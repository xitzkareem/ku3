       "      <td>Sometimes the power of Christmas will make you do wild and wonderful things. You do not need to believe in the Holy Trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. The simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. One congregation in Ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on Christmas Eve. The pastor at Grand Lake United Methodist Church in Celina, Ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of Jesus.\\n\\nFor many religious people the message of Jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. The sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. Jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time – but what would a generous act look like in our times? That was the focus of the sermon.\\n\\nThe potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! After the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. A bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this Christmas Eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.\\n\\nWhat did they do with this offering? Members of the congregation drove down to the local Waffle House to visit the ladies working the night shift. What a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!\\n\\nThe ladies working at Waffle House clearly were not with their families. They had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. The congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. They donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at Waffle House.\\n\\nIn total that amounted to $3,500 being split amongst the staff. What a beautiful moment! What a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! Doing a good deed like this on Christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at Waffle House. Sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.\\n\\nPerhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. It was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. It speaks volumes about the merits of the Church in our daily lives. This simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.</td>\n",

       "      <td>When a rare shark was caught, scientists were left blundering for answers. This shark has a unique feature. And it’s not that it can survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time. This shark’s unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth. If you’ve ever seen the hit science fiction movie “Alien,” this shark is that monster made manifest on earth. This shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite. It’s a deadly predator of the deep sea.\\n\\nBesides its telescoping teeth, this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in 1986. In the three decades since it was first found, just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found.\\n\\nBut during a routine survey in the Donghe Township in Taiwan, the country’s Fisheries Research Institute found five of these horrifying deep-sea sharks.\\n\\nThe team was notably horrified and described “the most obvious feature are the needle-shaped teeth, like snake-like fangs. This is also the origin of viper shark name.”\\n\\nThat’s right. This beast is called the viper shark. And as you can tell by its name, it is ferocious with its prey.\\n\\nAlthough researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals, little is known about them. But researchers think these creatures swim between 300-400 meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to 150 meters below at night. Could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light?\\n\\nThe last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of 350 meters below the surface of the sea. Four were already dead. But a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater. But it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat. It perished just a day later.\\n\\nWhile viper sharks look like the Alien monster from the movie, they do not feed on humans. Their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes. One of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish. These creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glow-in-the-dark bodies. And when they swim close enough, the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole.\\n\\nThe first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of Shikoku Island in Japan in 1986. Bottom-trawler vessel Seiryo-Maru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea.\\n\\nBecause the fish was a new discovery at the time, it’s scientific name honors the Seiryo-Maru captain, Hiromichi Kabeya. The shark’s scientific name was Trigonognathus kabeyai.\\n\\nAlthough not much about these fish are known, scientists classify them in as a dogfish shark. They have only been found in the deep parts of the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nHow would you react if this shark came up on the other end of your fishing line? Would you think you were having a nightmare?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Donald Trump has the unnerving ability to ability to create his own reality and convince millions of Americans that what he says it is true. The problem with the president lying is that he then believes his own lies. A new poll shows how that can get the country into deep trouble.\\n\\nThe new ABC News/Washington Post poll came out after the president’s physician gave him a physical and mental exam. The doctor gave Trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.\\n\\nThis poll was able to capture Americans’ opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around Trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. In addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear Trump tell the public that he was a “very stable genius” before they were interviewed. He said:\\n\\n‘Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.’\\n\\nThe ABC/Washington Post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. That left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.\\n\\nThen, there was the question of Trump’s mental stability. The poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. When asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.\\n\\nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was taken from January 15 through 18, 2018. The random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both English and Spanish. The margin of error was +/- 3.5 percentage points.\\n\\nFeatured Image via Getty Images/Drew Angerer</td>\n",

       "0  Sometimes the power of Christmas will make you do wild and wonderful things. You do not need to believe in the Holy Trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. The simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. One congregation in Ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on Christmas Eve. The pastor at Grand Lake United Methodist Church in Celina, Ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of Jesus.\\n\\nFor many religious people the message of Jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. The sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. Jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time – but what would a generous act look like in our times? That was the focus of the sermon.\\n\\nThe potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! After the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. A bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this Christmas Eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.\\n\\nWhat did they do with this offering? Members of the congregation drove down to the local Waffle House to visit the ladies working the night shift. What a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!\\n\\nThe ladies working at Waffle House clearly were not with their families. They had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. The congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. They donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at Waffle House.\\n\\nIn total that amounted to $3,500 being split amongst the staff. What a beautiful moment! What a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! Doing a good deed like this on Christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at Waffle House. Sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.\\n\\nPerhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. It was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. It speaks volumes about the merits of the Church in our daily lives. This simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "3  When a rare shark was caught, scientists were left blundering for answers. This shark has a unique feature. And it’s not that it can survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time. This shark’s unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth. If you’ve ever seen the hit science fiction movie “Alien,” this shark is that monster made manifest on earth. This shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite. It’s a deadly predator of the deep sea.\\n\\nBesides its telescoping teeth, this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in 1986. In the three decades since it was first found, just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found.\\n\\nBut during a routine survey in the Donghe Township in Taiwan, the country’s Fisheries Research Institute found five of these horrifying deep-sea sharks.\\n\\nThe team was notably horrified and described “the most obvious feature are the needle-shaped teeth, like snake-like fangs. This is also the origin of viper shark name.”\\n\\nThat’s right. This beast is called the viper shark. And as you can tell by its name, it is ferocious with its prey.\\n\\nAlthough researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals, little is known about them. But researchers think these creatures swim between 300-400 meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to 150 meters below at night. Could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light?\\n\\nThe last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of 350 meters below the surface of the sea. Four were already dead. But a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater. But it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat. It perished just a day later.\\n\\nWhile viper sharks look like the Alien monster from the movie, they do not feed on humans. Their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes. One of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish. These creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glow-in-the-dark bodies. And when they swim close enough, the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole.\\n\\nThe first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of Shikoku Island in Japan in 1986. Bottom-trawler vessel Seiryo-Maru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea.\\n\\nBecause the fish was a new discovery at the time, it’s scientific name honors the Seiryo-Maru captain, Hiromichi Kabeya. The shark’s scientific name was Trigonognathus kabeyai.\\n\\nAlthough not much about these fish are known, scientists classify them in as a dogfish shark. They have only been found in the deep parts of the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nHow would you react if this shark came up on the other end of your fishing line? Would you think you were having a nightmare?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "4  Donald Trump has the unnerving ability to ability to create his own reality and convince millions of Americans that what he says it is true. The problem with the president lying is that he then believes his own lies. A new poll shows how that can get the country into deep trouble.\\n\\nThe new ABC News/Washington Post poll came out after the president’s physician gave him a physical and mental exam. The doctor gave Trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.\\n\\nThis poll was able to capture Americans’ opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around Trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. In addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear Trump tell the public that he was a “very stable genius” before they were interviewed. He said:\\n\\n‘Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.’\\n\\nThe ABC/Washington Post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. That left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.\\n\\nThen, there was the question of Trump’s mental stability. The poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. When asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.\\n\\nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was taken from January 15 through 18, 2018. The random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both English and Spanish. The margin of error was +/- 3.5 percentage points.\\n\\nFeatured Image via Getty Images/Drew Angerer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "  'Article': 'Eric Dane, the actor best known for his roles on Grey\\'s Anatomy and Euphoria, has died less than a year after revealing he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was 53.\\nDane starred as family patriarch Cal Jacobs on hit HBO teen drama show Euphoria. Before that, he was perhaps best known as Dr Mark Sloan, or \\'Dr McSteamy\\', on medical drama Grey\\'s Anatomy.\\nThe California-born actor was diagnosed last year with ALS and spent the last few months raising awareness for the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).\\n\"With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS,\" reads a statement from his family.\\nHe was married to fellow actress and model Rebecca Gayheart, with whom he had two children.\\nThe written statement said he spent his final days surrounded by friends and his devoted wife, and his two daughters, Billie and Georgia, \"who were the center of his world\".\\n\"He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he\\'s received,\" it said.\\nDane also played Jason Dean in fantasy drama series Charmed, and Captain Tom Chandler in action drama show The Last Ship, while appearing in films such as Marley & Me, Valentine\\'s Day and Burlesque.\\nALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease, is a rare degenerative disease that causes progressive paralysis of the muscles.\\nIt affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, causing patients to slowly lose their ability to speak, eat, walk and breathe independently.\\nLast summer, Dane told ABC network\\'s Good Morning America that his diagnosis made him \"angry\".\\n\"Because, you know, my father was taken from me when I was young,\" he told the programme.\\n\"And now, you know, there\\'s a very good chance I\\'m going to be taken from my girls while they\\'re very young\".\\nHis father died by suicide when Dane was seven years old.\\nThe actor was born in San Francisco in 1972 and made his television debut in the Wonder Years in 1993.\\nDane\\'s Grey\\'s Anatomy co-stars are leading tributes to the late actor.\\nKim Raver - who plays doctor Teddy Altman in the series - said: \"During filming he\\'d get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you.\"\\nKevin McKidd, who plays trauma surgeon Owen Hunt, posted \"rest in peace buddy\" on Instagram.\\nEuphoria creator Sam Levinson told Variety: \"I\\'m heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend.\"\\n\"Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift,\" he said.\\n\\nCorrection 20 February 2026: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Kim Raver played Eric Dane\\'s on-screen wife in Grey\\'s Anatomy. Their characters had a short-lived romance but were not married.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The US state of New Mexico will reopen a criminal probe into a ranch once owned by Jeffrey Epstein, following allegations that surfaced in justice department files on the convicted sex offender.\\nState prosecutors said they would seek full access to unredacted Epstein files relating to the Zorro Ranch, held by federal investigators in Washington DC.\\nThey also pledged to work with a so-called Epstein truth commission set up this week in New Mexico.\\nThe state shelved its initial investigation into the ranch in 2019 upon request from federal prosecutors in New York. Epstein, who died in a Manhattan jail in 2019, faced no charges in New Mexico.\\nState Attorney General Raúl Torrez said on X that his office \"will take a broad and comprehensive\" look at the Zorro Ranch.\\nHe said they would work with an Epstein truth commission, set up by state legislators on Tuesday.\\nThe bipartisan, four-member panel is investigating allegations that the ranch might have facilitated sexual abuse and sex trafficking.\\nOne of the state legislators on the panel, Andrea Romero of Santa Fe, told the BBC: \"We are learning that there may have been reports to the FBI, back in 2019 or prior to, of bodies being buried, of folks being trafficked.\"\\nOn Wednesday, the state said it was investigating a 2019 email from the recently released tranche of files that alleged Epstein had ordered the bodies of two foreign girls be buried outside the ranch, Reuters news agency reported.\\nUS Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said last week he was seeking an unredacted copy of the email, which came from an anonymous sender.\\nLawmakers on the commission also want to know why Epstein did not register as a sex offender after having pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008.\\nWhile Epstein did not face any charges in New Mexico, prosecutors in the south-western US state confirmed in 2019 that they had interviewed possible victims who visited the property.\\nA number of women have previously alleged they were recruited and abused by the convicted paedophile at Zorro Ranch, which they said was integral to his sex-trafficking operation.\\nCongresswoman Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico told the BBC: \"In Zorro Ranch, it was very isolated, very beautiful landscape.\\n\"We have heard very disturbing reports of some of the activity going on there.\"\\nShe added: \"We know that there are horrible things that occurred at that ranch.\"\\nThere are thousands of references to the ranch, located south of Santa Fe, in the millions of documents released in late January by the US justice department.\\nIt boasts a 21,000sq ft mansion on a hilltop overlooking nearly 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of desert.

This was the smallest deficit for around in two decades.\\nBut the US still recorded record trade gaps with several countries, including Mexico, Vietnam and Taiwan.\\nOverall, the deficit in goods and services - which takes into account things like travel and digital services - was $901.5bn last year, almost unchanged from $903.5bn in 2024.\\nThe White House has also said it will take time for its efforts to pay off.\\nBut Trump\\'s frequent revisions to the tariffs have raised uncertainty about the strategy.\\nThe president has used the threat of tariffs during international negotiations. Most recently, he signed an executive order stating the US would impose additional taxes on countries that continue to trade with Iran.\\nThe Supreme Court is also currently weighing a challenge to the duties brought by a group of businesses and states, which could lead to the bulk of last year\\'s tariffs being struck down.\\nIf the Trump administration loses the case, White House officials have said they are prepared to reinstate the tariffs using different tools.\\n\"Looking ahead there will inevitably be more rejiggering in supply chains, but we see scope for a modest ascent in imports in spite of tariffs in the year ahead,\" analysts at investment bank Wells Fargo wrote.\\nMeanwhile on Thursday, a report by the JP Morgan Chase Institute focusing on mid-size firms, found that many businesses had started shifting business away from China before the new tariffs went into effect.\\nOverall, the bank\\'s data suggested foreign imports appeared little changed last year, despite monthly tariff payments roughly tripling.\\n\"The broader effects of trade policy changes may only become apparent with a significant lag,\" the report concluded, noting policy uncertainty and the difficulty of finding alternate suppliers.\\n'},\n",

A White House official said on Wednesday that Iran would be \"very wise\" to strike an agreement.\\nYet for all the talk of diplomacy, Trump has ramped up his rhetoric against the Islamic Republic in recent weeks, and ordered what analysts say is the biggest US military buildup in the Middle East since the Iraq War in 2003.\\nIt is another striking example of Trump\\'s willingness to use military force more often than supporters had expected in his second term, and without prior approval from Congress.\\nTrump\\'s threat to strike Iran cannot simply be dismissed as a negotiating tactic, since the last time he threatened an adversary with military action the US followed through with its attack on Venezuela in January.\\nThat operation had a narrow military objective, at least as defined by the administration, and ended with the successful capture of former President Nicolás Maduro.\\nWith Iran, the rationale for another military campaign is far less clear.\\nTrump does not want Tehran to develop nuclear weapons, a priority shared by US allies.\\nThe Islamic Republic, which has been weakened by economic sanctions and mass protests against the regime led by the country\\'s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has signalled it\\'s open to negotiate on the issue of uranium enrichment.\\nThe indirect talks between the US and Iran have stalled over the administration\\'s insistence that Tehran also curb its ballistic missile programme and support for proxy groups in the region.\\nBut while the negotiations may have deadlocked, Trump hasn\\'t spelled out why attacking Iran again now - less than one year after a US strike last June - will yield the outcome he\\'s after.\\nTrump has insisted the US strike on Iran last year \"obliterated\" the regime\\'s nuclear facilities.\\nThe president hasn\\'t offered an explanation of why another strike is needed, if that is the case, or what, exactly, the new targets might be.\\nAnd unlike in Venezuela, Trump\\'s broader objectives in Iran remain something of a mystery.\\nDoes the administration want to usher in regime change in Iran?\\nIs the US prepared for an Iranian military response that would target American military bases in the region?\\nHow might a prolonged conflict affect America\\'s other strategic goals in the Middle East, including the Board of Peace-led process to rebuild Gaza?\\nTrump has offered few details on his thinking about potential day-after scenarios.\\nIsrael\\'s role in a potential attack also remains unclear.\\nIsrael joined the US in striking Iran last year, and is widely expected to participate again if Trump launches a new military campaign.\\nIsrael\\'s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump at the White House last week to discuss the situation.\\nWith his first official State of the Union address of his second term looming next week, Trump also faces additional pressure to make the case for how a potential attack on Iran fits into his domestic political agenda.\\nTrump ran for the presidency in 2024 with a promise to disentangle the US from foreign conflicts - a stance that\\'s popular with his Maga base and many Republicans in Congress who oppose US intervention in places like Ukraine.\\nSince taking office, however, Trump has launched numerous military attacks, including in Syria, Venezuela, Iran and on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.\\nAn extended air campaign in Iran would risk alienating some supporters ahead of the US midterm elections, in a moment when opinion polls suggest voters are increasingly frustrated with Trump\\'s handling of issues like immigration and the economy and when the president has drawn criticism for his focus on foreign affairs.\\nA major attack on Iran would also conflict with Trump\\'s push for the Nobel Peace Prize.\\nTrump has said he deserves it for ending eight wars since the start of his second term, a claim that is widely disputed.\\nThere is no precedent for a US president actively campaigning for the world\\'s most prestigious peace prize while wielding American military force abroad.\\nAll the uncertainty has left the rest of the world guessing about Trump\\'s motivations in edging the US closer to war with Iran.\\nStill, that may be exactly how the president likes it.\\nSince returning to the White House last year, the president has seemingly relished playing the role of the world\\'s dealmaker-in-chief.\\nTrump has presided over numerous signing ceremonies and international summits like the Board of Peace event on Thursday in Washington.\\nHis tariffs regime forced other countries to seek more favourable trade deals with the US, placing Trump at the centre of high-stakes negotiations over the global economy.\\nTrump commanded worldwide attention last month with the strike on Venezuela and his call for the US to seize control of Greenland.\\nThe dispute over Greenland was another instance where other nations struggled to interpret Trump\\'s true intentions.\\nWhen it comes to Iran, Trump said on Thursday that the world would have to wait and see what he might do.\\n\"We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen,\" he said.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'BBC Verify has confirmed a second US aircraft carrier appears to be heading towards the Middle East, as Washington continues to put pressure on Iran over its military program and recent deadly crackdown on protesters.\\nUSS Gerald R Ford, the world\\'s largest warship, briefly broadcast its location as being off Morocco\\'s Atlantic coast on Wednesday. In the 48 minutes where its location data was public, the vessel appeared to be heading towards the Mediterranean Sea.\\nBut the carrier has not yet been sighted crossing the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean and an aircraft which operates from it was tracked returning to the Atlantic on Thursday.\\nUS and Iranian officials met on Tuesday for a second round of talks, with progress reportedly made between negotiators in Switzerland. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the world will find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether the US will reach a deal with Iran or take military action.\\nOn Monday, BBC Verify identified another aircraft carrier - USS Abraham Lincoln - in satellite images taken on Saturday off the coast of Oman, about 700km (430 miles) from Iran.\\nThe arrival of two of the 11 aircraft carriers operated by the US Navy adds to what we know about the military build-up in the Middle East over the past few weeks, where BBC Verify has tracked an increase of destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.\\nBoth Gerald R Ford and Abraham Lincoln lead strike groups with several guided missile destroyer warships. They are operated by more than 5,600 crew and carry dozens of aircraft.\\nUSS Gerald R Ford switched on ship-tracking automatic identification system (AIS) for the first time in 2026 at 12:30 GMT on Wednesday. The carrier transmitted its location, visible on ship-tracking website MarineTraffic, until 13:18 and was sailing in the direction of the Mediterranean.\\nHowever, a transport aircraft attached to the carrier which landed in Spain on Wednesday was tracked at about 13:00 on Thursday heading towards the area where the aircraft carrier was spotted.\\nThe appearance of Gerald R Ford comes after BBC Verify identified the Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea, around 240km (150 miles) off the coast of Oman, in publicly available images captured on Saturday by the European Sentinel-2 satellites.\\nThe Abraham Lincoln had not been seen since it reportedly entered the region in January but it had been crossing the open sea where satellite coverage is limited. Military assets on land are more visible and frequently captured on satellite.\\nBBC Verify has now tracked 12 US ships in the Middle East: the Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered Nimitz-class carrier, which together with three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers forms a carrier strike group; plus two destroyers capable of carrying out long-range missile strikes and three specialist ships for combat near to the shore that are currently positioned at Bahrain naval station in the Gulf. Two other destroyers have been seen in the eastern Mediterranean near the Souda Bay US base, and one more in the Red Sea.\\nWe have also been following the movements of large numbers of US aircraft to both European and Middle Eastern airbases, including:\\nF-35 and F-22 fighter jets\\nKC-135 and KC-46 refuelling tankers used to support the long-range movement of other aircraft\\nE-3 Sentry command and surveillance aircraft designed to coordinate large-scale operations\\nIn response to recent US military movements, Iran has carried out its own show of force.\\nOn Monday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran. The exercise saw IRGC Commander‑in‑Chief Maj Gen Mohammad Pakpour inspecting naval vessels at a harbour before missiles are seen launching from a ship, the IRGC-linked Tasnim News Agency reported.\\nThe Strait is considered one of the world\\'s most important shipping routes and a vital oil transit choke point. Around a fifth of the world\\'s oil and gas flows through the Strait, including from Kharg Island, Iran\\'s main oil export terminal. Pakpour was seen flying over the island in a helicopter in the report showing Iran\\'s latest military manoeuvres.\\nFootage broadcast by Iranian state TV on Thursday also showed planned naval drills in the Gulf of Oman with Russia, which involved a simulated ship rescue operation.\\nThe Fars news agency - which is affiliated with Iran\\'s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - said \"operational units from both Iran\\'s regular army\\'s navy and the IRGC navy\" took part.\\nMilitary intelligence expert Justin Crump told BBC Verify that the current US military preparations in the Middle East show \"more depth and sustainability\" than its manoeuvres ahead of the seizure of former Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in January, or the operation carrying out air strikes on Iran\\'s nuclear facilities last June.\\nThey all feature a carrier strike group and several destroyers operating independently. However, the US deployed its assets in Venezuela and Iran last year under quite different circumstances.\\nThe US deployed the Gerald R Ford to the Caribbean ahead of its strikes on Venezuela, one of eight warships we tracked in the region at the time, though it used fewer aircraft as it could easily send jets from surrounding US bases on America\\'s mainland or from its base in Puerto Rico instead.\\nThe US also deployed amphibious assault ships within the Caribbean, which can be used as launch platforms for helicopter operations as was seen with the capture of Maduro. But Venezuela\\'s military is generally seen as less capable of defending itself or retaliating against the US.\\nWhen the US struck Iran last year in Operation Midnight Hammer, which targeted Iran\\'s nuclear facilities, it was attacking a country with a much more powerful military than Venezuela. Iran\\'s military is capable of hitting US bases across the Middle East.\\nThe recent build-up in the region more closely resembles that seen during Operation Midnight Hammer. The US had two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region, five destroyers placed in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, and three combat ships in the Gulf.\\nIt had also moved squadrons of fighter jets and refuelling aircraft from the US to Europe. But the B2 stealth bomber flights that were used to hit the Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites actually took off from US bases in Missouri.\\nCrump, chief executive of risk and intelligence company Sibylline, said the build-up of US warships and aircraft, as well as eight existing airbases in the region would allow it to conduct a \"fairly intensive and sustained strike rate\" of about 800 sorties a day, with the aim of rendering any Iranian responses \"ineffective\".\\n\"What we are seeing isn\\'t just strike preparation, but rather a broader deterrent deployment capable of being scaled up or down,\" he said. \"This means it has more depth and sustainability than the force packages arranged for either Venezuela or Midnight Hammer last year. It\\'s designed to sustain an engagement and counter all potential responses against US assets in the region and, of course, Israel.\"\\nAdditional reporting by Barbara Metzler, Ghoncheh Habibiazad, Thomas Copeland, Yi Ma\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'When authorities in Truckee, California, learned of a large avalanche that hit a group of backcountry skiers, they rushed into action.\\nEmergency messages came on Tuesday at 11:30 local time (19:30 GMT) from a group guide\\'s iPhone, using satellite-texting capabilities, as well as from another skier\\'s emergency distress beacon.\\nThe 15-person group was at the end of a three-day trip to the Frog Lake Huts in the popular Castle Peak mountain region when the avalanche struck, according to the Nevada County Sheriff\\'s Office.\\nBut with nearby Highway 80 closed due to an ongoing massive storm, it was a challenge to reach the group, and authorities had to improvise.\\nThe trapped skiers were directly across the snow-blocked highway from the Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, also closed due to the weather, but the resort was able to deploy rescue teams in an attempt to reach them. Another nearby resort, Tahoe Donner\\'s Alder Creek Adventure Center, also sent teams. Some used a snow-cat, a manned vehicle that runs on treads in order to move on top of deep snow. They are most commonly used for grooming ski runs, but can also transport people.\\nBy Tuesday afternoon, around 50 rescuers were working to reach the site, arriving from both the south and north of the mountain. At 17:30, they arrived at an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.\\nThe accident site was about as large as a football field, according to officials.\\nFor rescuers in any avalanche, time is crucial. People who are fully buried under avalanche snow normally die from asphyxiation in less than one hour. But, roughly half of avalanche fatalities in North America are caused by blunt force trauma, rather than burial, according to a recent study.\\nRescue teams, as well as the group trapped by the avalanche, used special climbing skins on the underside of their skis, allowing users to travel uphill and through the backcountry.\\nEventually, they found a group of six alive, stranded on the mountain and trying desperately to shelter from the storm.\\nTwo of the six survivors had to be carried back and \"could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche,\" said Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. One person remained missing as of Wednesday afternoon, and is presumed dead.\\n\\nAuthorities on Wednesday said it was too dangerous to try to recover the bodies of those killed- seven women and two men - until the weather clears. Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tours. The entire group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.\\nOne of the deceased was the spouse of a rescuer, but Woo said that even with the personal tragedy, the rescue team remains focused.\\n\"Everybody has circled around to provide their love and condolences for this family,\" Woo said. \"But I think it\\'s also motivated the team of their purpose - to go out there and rescue those who were still alive, and now recover those decedents who are still out there.\"\\nAvalanche danger in the region remains high due to an unstable base and new snow that continues to \"load\" dangerous slopes, according to forecasters with the Sierra Avalanche Center.\\nThey had warned on Monday of naturally occurring avalanches starting far overhead, and eventually coming down through the clouds.\\nWhile it is unclear exactly how rescuers found the survivors, skiers buried in an avalanche typically are advised to try to stick a hand out of the snow to alert rescuers, create a shell with their arms to ease breathing for as long as possible, and remove skis to avoid being pulled deeper into the snow. And experts warn against panicking, which can lead to breathing too quickly.\\nBackcountry skiers usually carry a shovel, beacon and probe as a precaution.\\nEach of the skiers in the California group had a beacon, probably the most vital tool in emergencies, to send out a signal to help pinpoint the user\\'s location. Most ski trips begin with skiers\\' beacons in transmit mode but after an avalanche, survivors switch beacons to search mode, which use arrows on the device\\'s screen and audio cues, to help rescuers find them.\\nOther safety devices are growing in popularity, including backpacks that inflate to help avalanche survivors, however officials in California say it\\'s not known whether anyone in the group was equipped with these devices.\\nAuthorities had initially been told that the group was made up of 16 people, but later said they found out that one person had backed out of the trip at the last minute.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'A luminous outline of Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores loomed over Caracas against the night sky in January. The steady light of hundreds of drones in a show put on by the government in Venezuela, suspended their image in front of the clouds, before rearranging to call for their return: \"El pueblo los reclama,\" they spelled out, \"the people want them back\".\\nAfter a lightning operation by the US to spirit the deposed president and his wife out of the country on 3 January, Venezuela has found itself in limbo.\\nDespite Delcy Rodríguez, the former vice president and now acting Venezuelan leader, calling for the return of Maduro and Flores, there are no signs that\\'s going to happen. The former first couple are in New York in Brooklyn\\'s Metropolitan Detention Center awaiting trial for alleged crimes including drug trafficking, all of which they deny.\\nNevertheless, Rodríguez - a Maduro loyalist - must maintain a tricky equilibrium: appealing to her socialist base by continuing to support Maduro through anti-imperialist rhetoric, while at the same time changing policies under pressure from US President Donald Trump, with the threat that she could be following Maduro if she won\\'t comply.\\n\"Trump has implied that Venezuela is now a US protectorate, so she serves at the will of the US president,\" says Christopher Sabatini, senior research fellow on Latin America at Chatham House think tank. \"She has also been investigated by the DEA - there\\'s not a conviction, or bounty on her head, or indictment, but that threat has hung out there. The threat is, \\'we have the goods on you\\'.\" The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) did not comment when approached by the BBC.\\nRodríguez is now walking a diplomatic tightrope. \"President Maduro had already warned of an attack of this nature due to the desperation of the United States\\' energy voracity,\" Rodríguez said in her first statement after the operation. Yet shortly afterwards, Trump announced that Caracas had agreed to deliver up to 50 million barrels of oil - and that he would manage the money.\\nAnd in her first speech to the National Assembly on 16 January, Rodríguez criticised \"imperialist expansion by the United States\". That same day, Rodríguez met with CIA Director John Ratcliffe in Caracas. Rodríguez has been contacted for comment.\\n\"Rodríguez\\'s legitimacy lies in the military strength of the US. And it will last if Trump wants it to. She cannot stand up to him,\" says Carmen Beatriz Fernández, Venezuelan political analyst and CEO of DataStrategia, a political consultancy firm.\\nOne question is how long Rodríguez can keep this double act of keeping both the Venezuelan left and the US administration onside? And if she had to choose, would it be a tough choice or does one side very obviously hold the power?\\nCaracas, Venezuela\\'s capital city of around three million people, is festooned with banners calling for Maduro\\'s return and decrying US interventionism.\\n\"She is handling communication in the best possible way and establishing guidelines for the country to continue moving forward despite the hijacking,\" Leonardo Arca, 39, a civil servant, tells the BBC during a small pro-government march in Caracas last month. These big public displays calling for Maduro\\'s return are usually organised by the government, and it\\'s common for people to be told to go by their bosses.\\nHe carries a banner that reads \"Free Cilia\". Other people carry signs that read \"Yankee go home\" or \"Bring them back\" in English.\\nSince Maduro and Flores were detained, what feels like years of changes have been crammed into a few short weeks.\\nThe superpower of Chavismo, the left-wing political ideology that sustained the leaderships of Hugo Chavez and Maduro after him, is that it can quickly change course to keep the president - whoever that might be - in power.\\nOn assuming the presidency on a \"temporary\" basis, Delcy Rodríguez - a lifelong Chavista - appointed mostly technocrats rather than ideologues with a nod to the need for pragmatism as Venezuela entered a new era.\\nAlong with passing a law paving the way for US oil companies to start work in Venezuela, she also allowed for the release of numerous politicians and human rights activists who had been imprisoned for months or years. The opposition claims this has only happened because the US pressured them into it and point out that many political prisoners still remain in jail.\\nTrump has referred to Rodríguez as \"a wonderful person\" and \"someone we have worked very well with.\" Rodríguez, in turn, has acknowledged that there have been telephone calls and said that the tone is \"courteous\" and \"mutually respectful.\"\\nHe has also acknowledged the diplomatic bind that Rodriguez is in. When asked by a reporter what he thought of her statements that Maduro is still the legitimate president, he dismissed it by saying: \"I think she probably has to say that.\"\\nRodríguez has avoided making inflammatory remarks against Trump. But she has used language deeply rooted in Latin American communist opposition to US expansionism, referring to the US as a \"lethal nuclear power\", \"invader\" and, \"imperialist\".\\nPhil Gunson, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank based in Caracas, says: \"Washington must understand that she must continue with this rhetoric. It is a way of maintaining cohesion in the Chavista project, even though it is known that it is not real.\"\\nAll experts we spoke to agree that the pressure and threat from the US on Venezuela and Rodríguez is real.\\n\"US pressure may escalate,\" says Ana Milagros Parra, a Venezuelan political scientist. She says options for the US could include further intervention in Venezuelan territory, more economic sanctions and further oil blockades.\\nWhile Rodríguez must keep the leftist Chavismo grassroots happy, they only represent 15-20% of society and there are many Venezuelans who were never supportive of Maduro.\\nDuring his 13 years in power, Maduro\\'s popularity waned. His 2024 election win was called into question after widespread international accusations that the vote was rigged. Opposition tallies collected by their election observers - which were independently reviewed - showed their candidate won 67% of the vote compared with Maduro\\'s 30%. But nevertheless, Maduro assumed office claiming a 53% victory.\\nMore than 7.9m Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, with 6.5m counted as refugees by the UNHCR, showing the scale of the civil and economic crisis that has gripped the country.\\n\"This was not a popular government,\" Sabatini says. \"Most Venezuelans are feeling more optimistic about his removal.\"\\nThere is one major factor that could work in Rodríguez\\'s favour: the promise of respite for the long-struggling Venezuelan economy. The country\\'s inflation is by far the highest in the world, and 86% of Venezuelans were in poverty in 2024 according to the Venezuelan Finance Observatory.\\nFood in Venezuela is staggeringly expensive. Research carried out in 2025 found that a basic food shop composed of 60 everyday items cost $526.83 (£421). Venezuelans, battered by years of hyperinflation, are hoping US investment will ease the crisis but with the US focus so far firmly on the oil industry, it is not yet clear how much - and how quickly - any of it will trickle down to the average worker.\\nDelcy Rodríguez is also having to navigate a tricky balancing act within the military, who are loyal to Maduro.\\nInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello wields great power and Rodríguez is treating him cautiously. \"He sits atop not just a deeply corrupted military or national guard, but also a ragtag group of paramilitaries called the colectivos… They have been the shock troops sent to threaten protests,\" says Christopher Sabatini. \"This is his (Cabello\\'s), if you will, private army. He has a $25m (£20m) bounty on his head in the US.\" The BBC has contacted Cabello for comment.\\nWhile this bounty shows the US has him in its crosshairs, the two nonetheless appear together at events, showing an uneasy alliance. \"There\\'s a theory that they\\'re playing good-cop-bad-cop,\" Sabatini adds. \"She knows she needs him to maintain the security forces and keep them on her side… but as long as they don\\'t interfere with her momentum of attracting investors and most of the elements of the Trump administration, he serves her purpose.\"\\nDespite this massive balancing act and all the US\\'s might, some argue that Rodríguez is not as powerless against Trump as it might first appear.\\nAccording to Sabatini, Trump is desperate for the world to see the extraction of Maduro as an unqualified success.\\n\"Trump wants to see Venezuela continue on the path it\\'s on, he doesn\\'t want anything to contradict the narrative that everything is hunky dory. Trump doesn\\'t want to see the oil hit the fan, so to speak.\\n\"(So) she has some leverage over Trump, which most people don\\'t realise. She\\'s not just a secondary partner,\" Sabatini says.\\n\"It\\'s more of an equal partnership than Trump would like.\"\\nSplits within the US administration itself could also have strengthened Rodríguez\\'s hand. Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, has an explicit anti-communist agenda and is believed to want to see her government overthrown.\\n\"Rubio… regularly speaks to the opposition, who are unhappy. There are rumblings of discontent,\" says Sabatini. \"Rubio and others will push for early elections but it\\'s up to her when they are held.\"\\nAnd the better things are in Venezuela, the more likely she is to call the elections. \"She wants to wait to see the economy lifted so she could potentially run and win,\" Sabatini adds.\\nIndeed, this pragmatism runs through Rodríguez\\'s political DNA. \"Chavismo is pragmatic. Its main objective is to survive, and maintain power and wealth,\" says Phil Gunson.\\nAs Ana Milagros Parra says: \"They bend so as not to break.\"\\nAnd it seems that this means that even up against the might of Trump, Rodríguez is not completely without power.\\nWith additional reporting by Nicole Kolster from Caracas\\nTop picture credit: Reuters and Getty Images\\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said she was \"not in good physical health\", but had no reported cognitive issues.\\nPolice also say they found blood on the floor of Guthrie\\'s porch - which was confirmed to be hers.\\nOfficials have released doorbell-camera videos and images showing a masked and armed suspect on Guthrie\\'s doorstep the night she disappeared.\\nThe footage showed the suspect - who the FBI said appears to be a male between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) - covering a camera lens with some plants.\\nHe was wearing a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack, the FBI added.\\nThe man\\'s clothes are believed to have been bought at Walmart, according to Nanos, the Pima County sheriff.

It says it has received more than 13,000 tips from the public since Guthrie\\'s disappearance.\\nPresident Donald Trump, who ordered federal authorities to help in the investigation, has called the case \"very unusual\".\\nA number of possible ransom notes have been reviewed by investigators, some of which were first sent to media outlets.\\nAuthorities have not said that any of these has been verified as having been sent by Guthrie\\'s suspected abductor.\\nAt least one of them has been determined by the FBI to be fake, which led to the arrest of a man in California.\\nOne of the possible notes was said by FBI Special Agent Heith Janke to have set a deadline for a multimillion-dollar sum to be paid in bitcoin by 5 February, or a higher figure to be paid by 9 February.\\nOn 6 February, authorities said they were investigating a new message. They did not say who received the note or provide any details about what it said.\\nIn several emotional videos, Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have commented on the alleged ransom notes and pleaded for their mother\\'s safe return.\\nOn 4 February, Savannah said \"we are ready to talk\", telling the abductor or abductors directly that \"we need to know without a doubt that she is alive and you have her\".\\nIn a separate video the following day, her brother Camron said the family still had not received any contact from \"whoever is out there holding our mother\".\\nIn another video on 6 February, the family released a third video in which Savannah Guthrie said: \"We received your message, and we understand. We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her.\"\\nShe added: \"And we will pay.\"\\nFurther video updates have followed, including one that was shared on 12 February that showed images of a young Nancy with her children.\\nTwo weeks after her mother went missing, Savannah made another direct appeal to the person or persons who may have taken her mother, saying: \"It is never too late to do the right thing.\"\\nSavannah Guthrie, 54, is an American broadcast journalist who has served as the co-anchor of NBC News\\' Today since 2012.

He stands by that fervently.\"\\nOnly Democratic lawmakers attended the deposition. No Republican lawmakers travelled for it, though some of their staff members did attend.\\nThe Democrats addressed reporters after the session.\\n\"We should be very clear that there would be no Epstein island, there\\'d be no Epstein plane, there\\'d be no money to traffic women and girls, Mr Epstein would not be the wealthy man he was, without the support of Les Wexner,\" congressman Robert Garcia, of California, said.\\nAlthough Wexner gave his testimony behind closed doors, his opening statement was made public.\\nIn the statement, Wexner said his relationship with Epstein was limited, and denied any knowledge of the convicted sex offender\\'s abuse.\\n\"I was naive, foolish and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,\" he said. \"He was a conman. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.\"\\nHe said he was \"pleased to testify\" and wanted \"to set the record straight\".\\nWexner also said he had visited Epstein\\'s private island for \"a few hours\" with his family.\\nThe pair\\'s relationship dates back to the 1980s and Wexner has said he cut ties after Epstein was accused of sexually abusing children in Florida.\\nWexner has also said he later discovered Epstein \"had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family\" - a statement he repeated in his opening remarks on Wednesday.\\nThe retail magnate was identified in a 2019 FBI document as a potential co-conspirator. A separate email also said there was \"limited evidence regarding his involvement\".\\nDeputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche previously said Wexner\\'s name \"appears in the files thousands of times\".\\nWexner\\'s lawyers recently told the BBC: \"The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner\\'s legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.\\n\"Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.\"\\n'},\n",

The small businesses and US states challenging his administration\\'s tariffs claim that the president has overstepped his authority.\\nThe Supreme Court could rule on the case as soon as this Friday.\\nThe US central bank, which sets interest rates, has been under pressure from Trump to lower borrowing costs more aggressively.\\nFederal prosecutors recently opened a criminal investigation over testimony the central bank\\'s chair, Jerome Powell, gave to the Senate about renovations to Fed buildings.\\nThe president has also taken aim at Fed governor Lisa Cook, whom he wants to remove.\\nThe Fed has been monitoring the effects of tariffs on inflation. Officials voted to hold interest rates steady at their meeting in January, citing signs of stabilisation in the labour market.\\nAt the same time, inflation in the US cooled last month, according to the Department of Labor, as prices for energy and used cars fell.\\nThe retreat could add fuel to arguments by Trump and others that the Fed was in a position to cut interest rates without stoking a new flare-up in prices.\\nBut some analysts have warned that further progress toward the Fed\\'s 2% inflation target could stall in the months ahead if companies start to pass on the costs of tariffs more fully to consumers.\\nMinutes from the Fed\\'s January meeting, released on Wednesday, underscored division among Fed officials as to the path forward for interest rates this year.\\nSome even cautioned about a risk of rate hikes if inflationary pressures persist.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'A scandal at the Winter Olympics has left the Canadian curling teams on the defensive and Canadians reeling over the crack in their country\\'s polite persona.\\nOver the weekend, Canadian curler Marc Kennedy had an expletive-filled outburst after Sweden accused him of cheating during a match, and later said his team might be the target of a \"premeditated\" attack by their rivals.\\nKennedy was accused of double-touching the curling stone, by making contact with the granite part of the stone with his finger after releasing it down the ice.\\nThe next day, Canadian women\\'s captain Rachel Homan was accused of the same thing.\\nBoth have denied the accusations, but Canada\\'s curling teams, who historically have dominated the sport, now face questions over their tactics.\\nWhile the curlers have shown their anger over the situation during matches, fans of the sport and Canadians have questioned whether the team acted in the spirit of curling.\\nIn a country well known for its \"niceness\", the cheating row has stung for some. The BBC asked tourists and locals in Montreal what they made of it.\\n\"It\\'s a sad day for Canadian sport,\" said Tim Gray, from Alberta. \"Integrity in the sport is important, even if you have to call it on yourself.\"\\n\"As Canadians, we aren\\'t supposed to do these things,\" said Samar, from Ontario.\\nWithout sportsmanship, said Dwayne from British Columbia, it\\'s not sport any more.\\nThere was a more nuanced take at the Royal Montreal Curling Club.\\nOne of the curling instructors, Ankara Leonard, said the publicity could be good for the sport by generating interest.\\nShe added: \"Do I think [Kennedy\\'s] finger affects the rock? No I do not. Do I think we have to play within the rules? Yes.\"\\nThe controversy began on Friday when Swedish player Oskar Eriksson accused Kennedy of touching both the handle of the curling stone and the granite.\\nAs the game continued, Kennedy and Eriksson got into a verbal back-and-forth that included expletives.\\nTheir exchange quickly went viral as a video emerged that appeared to show Kennedy pushing the stone with his finger after releasing it.\\nKennedy later said the Swedish team had asked officials \"to make sure we weren\\'t double touching\".\\nTouching the handle of the curling stone multiple times is allowed, as long as it does not take place beyond a boundary known as the hog line.\\nBut the Swedes\\' grievance seems to have been that the second touch by Kennedy appeared to involve him making contact with the granite part of the curling stone with his finger.\\nThis incident, and the later controversies, led World Curling to clarify the rules of the sport. \"During forward motion, touching the granite of the stone is not allowed. This will result in the stone being removed from play,\" they said.\\nAfter the match, Kennedy got a verbal warning from World Curling for using foul language, but he was not formally charged with cheating by the governing body.\\nThe next day, Kennedy said: \"I probably could have handled it better. But we\\'re human out there and there\\'s a lot of emotions. I\\'m not going to apologise for defending my teammates and standing up for myself.\"\\n\"I\\'ve curled my whole life, never once with the intention of getting an advantage through cheating,\" he added.\\nAn opinion piece in the Canadian news outlet, the Globe and Mail, pointed to some of the frustration felt back home\\n\"These Canadian curling teams are not fun bad guys. They come off like the sort of competitors who need so desperately to win that they will do anything - even things that are pointless - in order to get there.\"\\nCathal Kelly, the writer of the opinion piece, continued: \"There\\'s an easy way out of this - stop struggling. Stop acting like our curling reputation matters more than our national one. Be the bigger man and woman, even if you don\\'t think you did anything wrong.\"\\nThere was a second cheating row on Saturday when match officials accused the Canadian women\\'s team of the same violation by making contact with the granite.\\nRachel Homan said there was a \"zero percent chance\" there had truly been a violation, as she and her teammates looked on in frustration. The Canadians lost to the Swiss, 8-7.\\nOn Sunday, Great Britain\\'s men\\'s team was accused of the same violation.\\nBoth Homan and British men\\'s curler Bobby Lammie had stones removed from play due to alleged violations.\\nHoman later slammed the officials\\' decision to remove her stone during a defeat to Switzerland, saying it was \"insane\".\\nWorld Curling does not use video to review play, but they did send two officials to monitor how players released their stones in subsequent games.\\nCurling columnist and Olympian Tomi Rantamaki, in an article for The Curling News, warned that Canada\\'s dominance in the world of curling means its players should be mindful of the influence they have.\\n\"Young players in Finland, Korea, Italy, Sweden - everywhere - often copy what Canadian teams do. They copy the athlete\\'s delivery, the sweeping, the tactics, the communication,\" Rantamaki wrote. \"And they copy the behaviour.\"\\nUpdate 18 February: This article was amended to provide further explanation of the rules regarding double-touching and contact with the granite of the curling stone\\n'},\n",

However, the local sheriff told the BBC that said DNA may still play a role in finding Guthrie.\\nNancy Guthrie, mother of NBC television anchor Savannah Guthrie, has been missing since 1 February, when officials say she was taken from home against her will.\\nThe family have made repeated pleas for the return of the 84-year-old.\\nIn his comments to the BBC, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said he believed Guthrie was the victim of a targeted kidnapping, and that she was being held somewhere close to her home in Tucson.\\nNanos, who is leading the hunt, said he was confident they would find her - whether it took \"10 days, 10 months, or worse\".\\nDetectives have received close to 40,000 tips from the public, he added.\\nNanos said he did not see the lack of DNA matches as a setback, and added that DNA could still play a crucial part in solving the case.\\nThe glove was just one of several that were collected from various locations near Guthrie\\'s residence, though most turned out to have been discarded by people searching for the missing woman.\\nLast week, investigators released video footage taken from a doorbell camera at Guthrie\\'s front door that showed a masked man wearing gloves and a backpack.\\nIn the video, the suspect walks toward the camera and tries to cover it with his gloved hand before grabbing some brush from the front yard to block the camera\\'s view.\\nAfter conducting a forensic analysis of the video, the FBI said it believed the man was between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall, with an average build.\\nThe sheriff\\'s department said it was working with Walmart to determine who purchased a backpack worn by the suspect in the video, which is exclusively sold at the store.\\nMore than two weeks since Guthrie, 84, was reported missing, no arrests have been made, the sheriff\\'s department confirmed on Tuesday.\\nHowever, authorities noted that more DNA found at her home was being analysed - and that they are exploring other \"investigative genetic genealogy\" databases for DNA matches.\\nPolice said over the weekend that the Guthrie family, including Nancy Guthrie\\'s children and their spouses, were not suspects in her abduction.\\nNanos described Guthrie\\'s children and the rest of her family instead as \"victims\" in the disappearance.\\nGuthrie\\'s three children have posted multiple videos online pleading for their mother\\'s safe return in the two weeks since her disappearance, saying they were willing to pay her abductors.\\nOver the weekend, Savannah Guthrie posted another such video that addressed a potential kidnapper directly.\\n\"It is never too late to do the right thing,\" she said. \"We are here and... we believe in the essential goodness of every human being.\"\\nGuthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when a family member dropped her off at her home following a get-together at her daughter Annie Guthrie\\'s house.\\nMembers of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.\\nA massive search team mounted by both local police and the FBI have since been combing through Guthrie\\'s home and the surrounding area.\\nOfficials have warned that Guthrie needs regular medication and is \"not in good physical health\". They have said she has no reported cognitive issues.\\nPolice have also found blood on the floor of Guthrie\\'s porch that was confirmed to be hers.\\nThe FBI has increased the reward for information about her disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.\\n'},\n",

And because my network clearly doesn\\'t want us to talk about this, let\\'s talk about this.\"\\nColbert, host of The Late Show, went on to explain that new FCC guidance on the \"equal time\" rule - which requires certain TV and radio broadcasters to give equal time to rival political candidates - could have created legal trouble for the network, according to CBS lawyers.\\nThe FCC regulates radio, TV and satellite airwaves, giving it power over a range of matters, including mergers and decency complaints.\\nCBS flatly denied Colbert\\'s claims in a statement on Tuesday.\\n\"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep James Talarico,\" the network said.\\nTalarico, 36, is a Democratic candidate for a US Senate seat in Texas.\\nCBS added in a statement: \"The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates... and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.\\n\"The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.\"\\nThe full interview was later posted on YouTube, where FCC rules do not apply.\\nNews content has traditionally been exempted from the \"equal time\" rule.\\nBut the FCC has said the rule may soon apply to late-night programmes like Colbert\\'s. It may also apply to political radio programmes, which tend to have more conservative hosts and listeners.\\nAfter issuing the new guidance in January, Brendan Carr, the FCC chairman known for taking an expansive view of his power, said on X that \"for years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late-night & daytime talk shows qualify as \\'bona fide news\\' programmes - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes.\\n\"Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"\\nUS President Donald Trump has at times said he is considering pulling the FCC licence for several US networks that he says have aired views critical of his presidency.\\nParamount Global, the parent company of CBS, agreed in July to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute with Trump regarding an interview it broadcast on CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris.\\nBusiness commentators have questioned whether the deal was made partly so as to not affect Paramount\\'s planned merger with Skydance Media, which Trump had the power to halt.\\nCBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.\\nAnna Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC board, condemned the response by CBS, saying Colbert and the network had the First Amendment constitutional right to free speech.\\n\"This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration\\'s broader campaign to censor and control speech,\" she said in a statement, adding that the FCC had \"no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes\".\\nShe continued: \"It is no secret that Paramount, CBS\\'s parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.\"\\nShe has previously accused the FCC\\'s Republican leaders of using the equal-time rule to unfairly penalise critics in violation of the constitutional right to free speech.\\nThe Late Show is due to end its 33-year run in May.

       "  'Article': 'Jesse Jackson, a key figure during the US civil rights movement of the 1960s, was known for being the first African American to make the jump from activism to major-party presidential politics.\\nA protege of Martin Luther King Jr, Jackson built a career around working to politically organise and improve the lives of African Americans, and became a national force during his two White House campaigns.\\nWhile other African Americans sought the US presidency, Jackson was the first to find significant success at the ballot box – which would pave the way for those who came after, including Barack Obama and Kamala Harris.\\nOver the course of his career, Jackson built a movement to bring America\\'s increasingly diverse population together, with a message that centred on poor and working-class Americans.\\n\"No one else in the Democratic Party was talking about a multiracial, multi-ethnic democracy,\" Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said at an event in Chicago in August 2024 that celebrated Jackson. \"This movement wasn\\'t just about bringing us together, but about bringing us together around a progressive agenda.\"\\nA gifted orator, Jackson articulated the frustrations of those who felt like second-class citizens in the world\\'s most prosperous democracy. His speech to the 1988 Democratic National Convention, which ended with the refrain \"keep hope alive\", would be echoed decades later in the \"hope and change\" slogan of Obama\\'s successful 2008 presidential campaign.\\nAfter his historic run of presidential campaigns, Jackson went on to position himself as an elder statesman within the Democratic Party.\\nHowever, Jackson\\'s later years would be punctuated by scandal, including revelations of marital infidelity and financial impropriety involving his son and political heir, Jesse Jackson Jr, who served as a congressman from Illinois.\\nIn 2017, the elder Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson\\'s disease and largely withdrew from public life. That diagnosis was subsequently changed to one of progressive supranuclear palsy, a degenerative brain disease with similar symptoms.\\nJackson was born Jesse Louis Burns on 8 October 1941 in Greenville, South Carolina - the son of 16-year-old Helen Burns. Unmarried, she was expelled from her local Baptist church after she became pregnant - the result of an affair with a 33-year-old married neighbour, Noah Robinson.\\nWhen Jackson was two, his mother married Charles Jackson, who went on to adopt his new stepson. Jesse Jackson remained in touch with Robinson, and regarded both men as his fathers.\\nCharles Jackson was a religious man, and his son was brought up in the church - a traditional focus for black political resistance since the time of American slavery.\\nGrowing up in South Carolina, Jackson, like all black Americans, was segregated from his white neighbours. He was forced to attend separate schools and allowed only in designated areas in public places, like buses or restaurants.\\nIn high school, Jackson did well - being elected as class president and excelling in nearly every kind of team sport.\\nA football scholarship to the University of Illinois helped Jackson pursue his ambitions and escape his poor surroundings. But he soon transferred from the predominantly white institution to a historically black college in North Carolina.\\nHe said he left Illinois because his white coaches wouldn\\'t let him play quarterback in American football, although that account is disputed. Records show the team already had a black quarterback and Jackson was on academic probation.\\nAs a student in North Carolina A&T, Jackson gradually became involved with the civil rights movement. In 1960, he was arrested with seven other students after a silent demonstration in a whites-only public library, which led to the desegregation of the library.\\nFour years later, Jackson graduated and moved to Chicago, where he trained to become a religious leader and was noticed by King, the country\\'s most famous civil rights leader.\\nThrough the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King founded in 1957 to promote non-violent action to seek social and economic justice, he established Operation Breadbasket. The operation encouraged black men and women to frequent businesses that gave them basic courtesy and job opportunities, and to boycott those that did not.\\nStill in his 20s, Jackson was first asked to run the Chicago arm of the operation and, before long, to take on the national leadership.\\nIn 1968, Jackson\\'s life changed dramatically. He was with his mentor at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, when King was assassinated. Moments before the fatal shot, King was leaning over a railing in playful conversation with Jackson, who was standing in the parking lot below.\\nJackson told reporters that he cradled King\\'s head as he died - although other witnesses did not confirm that account. The next day, Jackson controversially appeared on television with his clothes still stained with King\\'s blood, assuming the mantle of civil rights leadership.\\n\"We were determined we would not let one bullet kill the movement,\" he later said.\\nJackson, like King had done in the years before his death, began speaking about America\\'s problems as rooted in class inequality as much as racism. The principal schism, he said, was between the haves and the have-nots.\\n\"When we change the race problem into a class fight,\" he told the New York Times, \"then we are going to have a new ball game.\"\\nThree years later, arguments over leadership led Operation Breadbasket to fracture and Jackson to form Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) - a new, wide-ranging civil rights group.\\nIn the years that followed, Jackson became one of the most influential political figures in America.\\nHis PUSH organisation championed inner-city education and affirmative action programmes that saw businesses employing black workers.\\nBut he remained a controversial figure, with allegations that he had once made antisemitic remarks, and - as an ordained minister and the result of an unwanted pregnancy - he opposed abortion.\\nThe issue was convulsing US politics after the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade. Democrats, who traditionally aligned with the civil rights movement, mostly supported keeping abortion legal.\\n\"Human beings cannot give or create life by themselves, it is really a gift from God,\" he wrote in 1977. \"Therefore, one does not have the right to take away that which he does not have the ability to give.\"\\nHe suggested that Moses and Jesus would not have been born, had abortion been a possibility in biblical times.\\nIn 1983, Jackson travelled to Syria to plead for the release of a captured American pilot, Lt Robert Goodman. His mission was successful, and greatly boosted his national profile.\\nWith black youth unemployment running at around 50%, Jackson then announced a run for president.\\nHis decision caused heartache for some of his natural supporters, including King\\'s widow, Coretta, who feared he would fail to win the Democratic Party\\'s nomination and damage the chances of other progressive candidates.\\nDuring the campaign, Jackson spoke about the \"rainbow coalition\", a broad group of voters from a variety of races and beliefs who were traditionally disadvantaged and who, Jackson said, had been hurt by the policies of then-President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.\\n\"Our flag is red, white, and blue, but our nation is a rainbow - red, yellow, brown, black, and white - and we\\'re all precious in God\\'s sight,\" he said in a speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, where he called for the party to unify.\\nJackson copyrighted the term and later founded a political group with the same name. The move irritated some members of the Black Panther organisation, who in the 1960s had used the term to describe an alliance between activists groups in Chicago.\\nWhile Jackson ultimately lost the Democratic nomination, his campaign had become a political and cultural phenomenon. In October 1984, he hosted Saturday Night Live – a popular weekly network television comedy programme.\\nHis presidential bid also had a profound effect on Democrats. By winning more than 3 million votes and coming third during the primaries, he showed that a black candidate could rally nationwide support and possibly take the White House.\\nAt the same time, by running on a liberal platform, he brought many of the issues important to the party\\'s left wing to the fore and gave them traction, such as universal healthcare and paying reparations to the descendants of slaves.\\nJackson was on record as a supporter of a Palestinian state, and had called Israel\\'s prime minister \"a terrorist\".\\nHe had also pledged never to use nuclear weapons first and to slash defence spending if he became president - positions that seemed impossible at the height of the Cold War.\\nHe tried for the White House again four years later and continued to campaign on a liberal agenda of higher taxes, increased public spending and universal, state-funded healthcare.\\nOnce more, he made an impressive showing - taking an early lead over Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee - but once more, he lost, this time after winning just under 7 million votes and 1,023 delegates to the Democratic National Convention.\\nThose delegates went on to back reforms to the party\\'s primary process that made it easier for insurgent candidacies like Jackson to compete for the party\\'s presidential nomination without backing from the Democratic establishment.\\nIn 1991, Jackson tried to repeat his Syrian triumph, and visited Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War to plead with Saddam Hussein to release Western hostages.\\nA year later, he decided against a third presidential run and, despite his suspicion of Bill Clinton\\'s centrist \"Third Way\" policies, lent his support to the former Arkansas governor.\\nWhen Clinton found his presidency in peril after the public learned about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, he asked Jackson to counsel his family through the crisis.\\nJackson said that, although Clinton had lied about the relationship, he did not deserve to be impeached for \"high crimes\". Clinton had committed a \"little crime\", he said.\\nIn 2001, Jackson was publicly called to account for his own affair, when it was revealed he had had a relationship with a member of his staff and fathered a child.\\nJackson promised to take leave to \"revive my spirit and reconnect with my family\", but the speed with which he returned to public life damaged his credibility with some clergy across America.\\nHe maintained a highly visible media profile with television shows and mercy missions, which some critics cast as self-promotion.\\nIn March 2007, Jackson pledged his support for Barack Obama\\'s campaign to become the first African American in the White House.\\nRelations between the two men were initially strained, after Jackson criticised Obama for \"talking down to black people\".\\nHis remarks were picked up by a nearby microphone and Jackson later apologised for his \"crude and hurtful remarks\".\\nBut, in the moments before Obama was due to make his victory speech in Chicago the following November, a television camera picked out Jackson in the audience with tears streaming down his cheeks.\\nMany of those watching suggested that Jackson\\'s success in boosting black turnout in previous presidential campaigns had helped ensure Obama\\'s victory.\\nHe later backed the new president\\'s decision to support gay marriage, comparing the situation to the earlier struggle against laws in the country that had barred interracial marriage.\\nWhile he continued to be a political force, he faced strain at home.\\nIn 2013, his oldest son - Jesse Jackson Jr - was convicted of using campaign money to fund his personal lifestyle and sentenced to 30 months in prison.\\nFive years later, Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson\\'s disease and had to step down as leader of Rainbow/PUSH, the merged organisation of his two earlier groups.\\nStill, after George Floyd, an African-American man, was killed by police officers in 2020, Jackson travelled to Minneapolis to plead for criminal charges against the officers.\\nAnd he was a loud voice in favour of withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan, and for increasing the minimum wage.\\nIn 2024, Jackson applied for a presidential pardon for his son\\'s conviction, but was refused by then-President Joe Biden.\\nThat year, the veteran campaigner also returned to the political realm he loved, making a rare appearance at the Democratic convention in Chicago, where the party officially nominated Kamala Harris for president.\\nHigh-profile delegates paid tribute to a man they said had done much to ensure a black woman had a significant chance of reaching the White House. Harris later lost the 2024 election to Donald Trump.\\n\"We learned at his feet,\" said Al Sharpton, a fellow veteran civil rights activist who had worked with Jackson at Operation Breadbasket decades earlier.\\nPramila Jayapal, a congresswoman from Washington state, addressed him as she spoke at the convention, saying: \"For every elected official we will see on that stage - we are here because you laid the path for us.\"\\n'},\n",

They are slow-walking it,\" the former US secretary of state told the BBC in Berlin, where she attended the annual World Forum.\\nThe White House insisted that by releasing the files they had done \"more for the victims than Democrats ever have\".\\nMillions of new files relating to the late sex offender Epstein were released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) earlier this month.\\n\\nAt the time, the deputy attorney general said three million pages were not released - due to the existence of personal medical files, graphic depictions of child abuse or other material that would jeopardise investigations.\\nWhen asked whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor should go before a congressional committee, Hillary Clinton said: \"I think everybody should testify who is asked to testify.\"\\nAppearing in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.\\nThe committee does not have the power to compel him to appear in front of them, but put pressure on the Clintons to do so, which they agreed to last month.\\nBill Clinton will make his appearance on 27 February and Hillary Clinton will appear the day before.\\nA planned vote to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress for initially refusing to appear was shelved after the pair agreed to testify. It will be the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.\\nHillary Clinton reiterated the couple\\'s call for their congressional committee hearing to be in public rather than a closed-door deposition.\\n\"We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public,\" Hillary Clinton told the BBC.\\nRepublican committee chair James Comer had accused the Clintons of \"delay\", saying the pair \"caved\" as a contempt vote loomed.\\n\"I just want it to be fair,\" said Hillary Clinton. \"I want everybody treated the same way.\"\\n\"We have nothing to hide. We have called for the full release of these files repeatedly. We think sunlight is the best disinfectant.\"\\nThe former presidential candidate argued that she and her husband were being used to divert attention away from Trump.\\n\"Look at this shiny object. We\\'re going to have the Clintons, even Hillary Clinton, who never met the guy.\"\\nHillary Clinton said she had met Ghislaine Maxwell - Epstein\\'s convicted associate - \"on a few occasions\".\\nBill Clinton - who was featured in the Epstein files - was acquainted with Epstein but said he cut off contact two decades ago.\\nNeither Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein\\'s abuse, and both have denied knowledge of his sex offending at the time.\\nThe millions of new files relating to Epstein that were made public by the US justice department earlier this month after Congress passed a law requiring the agency to release material related to investigations of Epstein.\\nThe Department of Justice (DoJ) has now said it has released all of the files required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers have argued the release is insufficient. Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who co-wrote the law, called for the DoJ to also release internal memos outlining past decisions on whether to charge Epstein and his associates.\\nEpstein took his own life in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited, without the chance of bail, his trial on sex trafficking charges. It came more than a decade after his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender.\\nAndrew, the former prince, has faced growing pressure from some US officials and the family of his prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre to testify before the Oversight Committee about his links to Epstein.\\nAndrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 containing no admission of liability. Giuffre died by suicide in 2025.\\nTrump - who is mentioned in the Epstein files - has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein\\'s victims.\\nWhen asked about Hillary Clinton\\'s comments in the interview, Trump told the BBC he had nothing to hide.\\n\"I\\'ve been exonerated. I had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. They went in hoping that they\\'d find it, and they found just the opposite,\" he said aboard Air Force One.\\n\"They\\'re getting pulled in. And that\\'s their problem... Clinton and many other Democrats have been pulled in.\"\\nIn relation to the allegations against Trump, the DoJ has previously said: \"Some docs contain untrue and sensationalist claims against Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear the claims are unfounded and false and if they have any shred of credibility they certainly would have been weaponised against Trump already.\"\\nThe White House said: \"By releasing thousands of pages of documents, co-operating with the House Oversight Committee\\'s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein\\'s Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"\\n'},\n",

Corfield\\'s was one of more than 1,100 names given to a hotline set up to report sexual abuse within the church, which has no official name but is often referred to as The Truth or the Two by Twos.\\nThe FBI launched a probe into the church around a month after the BBC published its investigation in early 2024, but Corfield remains free in the US state of Montana despite him saying investigators visited him more than a year ago.\\nWe have now spoken to a man who says he was also sexually abused by Corfield in 1974 when he was 11 years old - around a decade before he started abusing Michael. Corfield previously claimed to the BBC that he had not sexually abused anyone else.\\nThe FBI did not respond to requests for comment.\\nAsked about Michael\\'s case, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said it launched an investigation after it \"received a report of historic sexual assaults that occurred in the early 1980s\" in Saskatchewan and that its \"findings were sent to Crown Prosecutors for their assessment\".\\nThe Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice said it \"does not comment on whether it is reviewing cases under investigation by the police\".\\nThe Truth is believed to have up to 100,000 members worldwide, with the majority in North America.\\nIt was founded in Ireland by a Scottish evangelist in 1897 and is built around ministers - referred to by the church as workers - spreading New Testament teachings through word-of-mouth.\\nOne of its hallmarks is that workers give up their possessions and must be taken in by church members as they travel around, spreading the gospel. This makes children living in the homes they visit vulnerable to abuse, former members say.\\nWarning: This article contains details some readers may find upsetting\\nContacted by phone in December 2025, Corfield told the BBC that he was visited by the FBI a year ago.\\n\"They saw me in person. They basically reviewed information and I just responded with the truth,\" he said.\\nAsked whether he told them that he abused Michael, now 57, for six years starting when he was 12, Corfield replied \"yes\" before adding: \"It was a year ago - I don\\'t remember all the details.\"\\nHe added that the FBI \"were satisfied at that point and I haven\\'t been contacted by anyone else since\".\\nAsked if he was fearful of arrest, Corfield said: \"I realise there is that possibility.\"\\nHe was no longer attending church meetings, he added.\\nLast month, another man contacted the BBC about being abused by Corfield.\\nThe man, who is entitled to anonymity but we will call Edward, said that Corfield attacked him on a camping trip in Canada in 1974.\\n\"Robert got mad at me for something - I don\\'t remember exactly what that was. Then he called me into the camper,\" he said.\\n\"I can only remember him being angry and holding me down. I just remember the cushions being covered with that weird 70s floral pattern … he ended up holding me down on the bed,\" he added.\\n\"He went from angry to sexually assaulting me.\"\\nEdward recalled another time when a group of boys were swimming on church convention grounds and he saw Corfield watching, \"blanket over his lap, doing something inappropriate to himself underneath the blanket\".\\nCorfield \"was in constant grooming mode\", Edward said.\\nHe tried to tell his parents about what Corfield did to him, but said \"they wouldn\\'t even hear a name from me\".\\nThe power of the workers in the church means they are rarely challenged.\\n\"When my incident happened with Robert, I tried to talk to my parents about it and neither one of them would have anything to do with that, because he was a preacher and he could do no wrong,\" Edward said.\\n\"Our house was an open door, the workers had keys to the house,\" he added.\\n\"They were on the pedestal, they were the moral compass. The family kind of didn\\'t have a moral compass on its own, they only only looked at right and wrong based on what the workers said. Right and wrong wasn\\'t about what your heart or soul said.\"\\nEdward reported the attack to the RCMP in 2024 but the prosecutor\\'s office declined to prosecute the case due to lack of evidence.\\nCorfield declined to comment about the latest allegations when contacted last week.\\nHowever, the BBC has obtained two private letters Corfield sent to Michael, in 2004 and 2005, which asked for forgiveness and said he was seeing a therapist. In one letter, Corfield said he was \"making a list of victims\".\\nThe church has been thrown into crisis since more than 1,500 current and former members of the sect contacted a hotline set up by campaign group, Advocates for The Truth, in 2023.\\nThe Advocates have since ceased operations, but co-founder and private investigator, Cynthia Liles, is still running the hotline under the name 2x2 Church Accountability.\\nThere have been 1,164 allegations of sexual abuse, she said, with more than half of the accused in positions of authority. There have been approximately 75 convictions, she said.\\nBut despite Corfield admitting to sexually abusing a child for six years, he remains free.\\n\"I\\'m confused by the law enforcement in Canada. Robert is a confessed pedophile…he took responsibility for abusing me for six years,\" Michael told the BBC in a message.\\nHe also wants to see the church\\'s leadership face justice, some of whom have been accused of covering up abuse.\\nIn our previous investigation, Michael said he reported his abuse in 1993 to Dale Shultz, Saskatchewan\\'s most senior church leader - known as an \"overseer\". Overseers are the most senior members of the church and there is one for each US state and Canadian province where there is an active following.\\nBut Shultz didn\\'t go to the police and Michael says he violently assaulted him a few weeks later because he thought he had told others of the abuse claims.\\nMichael said Shultz then \"encouraged\" him to leave the church - while Corfield was moved to be a minister across the border, in the US state of Montana.\\nCorfield told the BBC in 2024 that he believed it was Shultz\\'s decision to send him to Montana, where he remained in post for 25 years.\\nShultz previously told the BBC that \"much of the information that you have received concerning me is distorted and inaccurate\". However he declined to go into any further detail.\\n\"I\\'m frustrated that the RCMP refused to include the leadership. They failed the membership,\" Michael said last week.\\n\"Robert is guilty, sure. Dale and all the enablers are guilty also,\" he added.\\nEdward said \"it\\'s completely ridiculous\" that Corfield is still free.\\n\"What kind of pressure does the RCMP need to feel to make this move forward?\" he said.\\nThe RCMP directed questions to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice, who declined to comment.\\nThe church itself has done little to address the sexual abuse crisis, said Liles, the private investigator, who herself was born into the sect before leaving.\\n\"In fact I think they\\'re going backwards,\" she said. \"I think they retracted from positions they originally took in an attempt to show that they were going to try to make changes.\"\\nSome states initially hired an organisation that helps Christian groups confront sexual abuses, she said, but the church ended up rejecting the policies.\\n\"They just said: \\'we don\\'t need any of this, we\\'re just going to use the Bible,\\'\" Liles said.\\nMany perpetrators of sexual abuse are back in church meetings, Liles said, including one man in Arizona who was jailed for rape in 1969, made a church elder upon release and then went on to abuse other children within the church.\\nThe BBC reached out to multiple church overseers for comment, but did not get a response.\\nWhile the wheels of justice are moving slowly for victims, many are connecting online. One Facebook group called \\'Exposing Abuse: 2x2s\\' has more than 10,000 members from across the world offering each other support.\\nAfter Corfield\\'s public confession two years ago, Edward reached out to Michael.\\n\"I reached out to Michael very, very soon after that and we managed to stay in contact over the last few years and develop a relationship,\" he said.\\n\"For us to know each other, it gets rid of that isolated \\'me against the world\\' feeling - it\\'s actually us against the church.\"\\nEdward is also now receiving counselling to work through his experiences in the church.\\n\"It\\'s not the church that\\'s helping to fund my counselling sessions, it\\'s a bunch of ex-church members,\" he said.\\n\"That\\'s been a godsend for me.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has said it has released all of the files required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers have argued the release is insufficient.\\nA letter sent to members of the US Congress on Saturday from US Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputy said all documents held by the DoJ had been released. It contained a list of names appearing in the files.\\nKentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who co-wrote the law, called for the DoJ to also release internal memos outlining past decisions on whether to charge Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.\\nMillions of new files relating to the late sex offender Epstein were released by the DoJ earlier this month. At the time, the deputy attorney general said three million pages were not released.\\nThis was due to the existence of personal medical files, graphic depictions of child abuse or other material that would jeopardise investigations, said Todd Blanche on the day of the documents dump.\\nIn the latest letter, Bondi and Blanche wrote: \"In accordance with the requirements of the Act, and as described in various Department submissions to the courts of the Southern District of New York assigned to the Epstein and Maxwell prosecutions and related orders, the Department released all \\'records, documents, communications and investigative materials in the possession of the Department\\' that \\'relate to\\' any of nine different categories.\"\\nNo records were withheld from the DoJ\\'s release \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity\", the letter added.\\nThe individuals listed in the letter include people who \"are or were a government official or politically exposed person\", and whose name appeared at least once in the files, the letter says.\\nThe names appear in the files in a \"wide variety of contexts\", including some people who had \"extensive direct email contact with Epstein or Maxwell\" and others who were merely referenced in documents or news articles contained in the files, Blanche and Bondi wrote.\\nDonald Trump, Bill Gates, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and Bill Clinton - who are included in the list - all had documented past relationships with Epstein and Maxwell. There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing and each has denied any involvement in Epstein\\'s crimes.\\nBut the list also includes the names of deceased musicians Janis Joplin and Elvis Presley.\\nThe letter was addressed to the Senate Judiciary Committee\\'s chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Dick Durbin, as well as the House Judiciary Committee\\'s chairman Jim Jordan and ranking member Jamie Raskin.\\nIn an interview on ABC This Week on Sunday, Massie argued that, even though the DoJ \"wants to say they are done with this document production\", there are more crucial files that should be released.\\nThe DoJ was \"signing deliberative process privilege in order not to release some of the documents\", he said.\\n\"The problem with that is the bill that Ro Khanna and I wrote says that they must release internal memos and notes and emails about their decisions on whether to prosecute or not prosecute, whether to investigate or not investigate.\"\\nIn response to the letter, California Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, who co-wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act, accused the DoJ of \"purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email\".\\n\"To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd,\" Khanna wrote on X on Saturday.\\n\"Release the full files,\" he added. \"Stop protecting predators. Redact only the survivor\\'s names.\"\\nThe BBC has contacted the Department of Justice for comment.\\nUS lawmakers previously said files on Epstein were improperly redacted ahead of their release, leading to at least one document being unredacted after their criticism.\\nLawyers for Epstein\\'s victims have also said the latest tranche of files included email addresses and nude photos in which the names and faces of potential victims could be identified.\\nAt the time, the DoJ said mistakes were due to \"technical or human error\" and they had taken down all the flagged files.\\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump\\'s second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher\\'s weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

The most recent funding measure passed at the end of January only funded the DHS for two weeks while lawmakers from both sides of the aisle attempted to reach a deal on immigration reforms.\\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump said \"we\\'ll see what happens\" when asked by reporters whether he anticipated cutting a deal with Democrats to fund the DHS.\\n\"We always have to protect our law enforcement,\" Trump added.\\nThe shutdown is expected to affect several agencies under the DHS umbrella, including the US Coast Guard and TSA.\\nLast year, the US government saw its longest full shutdown in history, which lasted 43 days and led to many federal workers going without pay as well as flight chaos. Democrats at the time were pushing for more health care funding to address rising health care costs.\\nCongress is set to take a recess until 23 February, meaning the shutdown could continue until Trump\\'s State of the Union address the following day.\\nHowever, lawmakers could be called back to Washington earlier if they seem on the brink of a deal.\\nThe partial shutdown is unlikely to cause as much travel chaos as last year\\'s because the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees air traffic controllers, has already been funded for the rest of the year.\\nBut TSA agents - who fall under the DHS - may have to go without pay if the shutdown drags on, meaning people could see longer lines at airports if workers call in sick.\\nThe US Coast Guard, which the DHS also oversees, could also be affected. Vice Admiral Thomas Allan told lawmakers that going a few days without funding would mean about 56,000 workers going without pay, leading the agency to suspend missions that were not critical or lifesaving.\\nDHS has $165bn (£120bn) from Trump\\'s One Big Beautiful Bill Act - which also included $75bn to fund ICE - that it could use to address some of the funding shortfalls.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The US House of Representatives this week passed legislation that would require people to provide proof-of-citizenship when registering to vote as the midterm elections approach.\\nThe Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE America Act, would require people to present a valid US passport or birth certificate.\\nThe proposal has raised concerns among some groups, including married individuals who have changed their names and may not have matching documents.\\nIn a post on his social media site Truth Social, Trump warned that there would \"be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!\"\\nDemocrats say the legislation disenfranchises eligible voters, while Republicans say it is necessary to prevent voter fraud.\\nThe bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where it does not have enough backers.\\nHere\\'s what to know about this legislation.\\nThe SAVE act would require Americans to prove they are US citizens when they register to vote. It would also require a valid photo identification before they cast their ballots.\\nSome states already require voters to show valid photo identification at the polls. Federal law mandates that voters in national election be US citizens, but it does not require mandatory proof of citizenship, as the proposed legislation would.\\nThis bill - a renewed version of a legislation introduced last year that was stalled - establishes a process for people whose names have changed to submit additional documents to verify their identity.\\nThe provision has drawn particular concern for individuals who changed their names after marriage.\\nUnder the legislation, election officials who register a voter without obtaining the required proof of citizenship could face criminal penalties.\\nAn estimated 21 million Americans do not have documents proving their citizenship readily available, and 2.6 million lack any form of government-issued photo ID, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal-leaning think tank, and the University of Maryland\\'s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement.\\nA Pew Research Center poll from last year found 83% of respondents favoured requiring all voters to show government-issued photo identification, including 71% of Democrat or Democratic-leaning voters and 95% of Republican or Republican-leaning voters.\\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly praised the legislation and encouraged his Republican party to push it through both chambers of Congress so he can sign it into law.\\nWhile supporting the bill, Trump has also repeated his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen. The president says the SAVE Act could stop that from happening.\\n\"American citizens, and only American citizens, should decide American elections,\" the White House posted on social media, referencing a common talking point of the president\\'s that there is widespread fraud in elections. There is no evidence to support this.\\nThis week in a post on Truth Social, Trump repeated false claims about election fraud and said he would be presenting an \"irrefutable\" legal argument in defence of the measure \"in the very near future\".\\nMembers of the president\\'s party, by and large, support the legislation, too.\\nCongressman Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin Republican, disputed Democrats\\' comments that the bill is \"voter suppression\".\\n\"Those allegations are false,\" he said, arguing that a bill is needed to enforce existing laws, especially those that prevent immigrants who are not citizens from voting.\\n\"The current law is not strong enough,\" Steil said.\\nIt is unclear if and when the Senate may vote on the measure.\\nThe legislation passed the House, mostly along party lines, in a 218-213 vote.\\nBut Majority Leader John Thune does not have the 60 votes he needs to pass the bill in the Senate.\\nSome have urged Thune to change the filibuster rules by lowering the threshold required to pass a bill.\\n\"There aren\\'t anywhere close to the votes, not even close, to nuking the filibuster,\" Thune said at a news conference on Tuesday. \"So that idea is something, although it continues to be put out there. … That doesn\\'t have a future.\"\\nIn addition, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said she would not back the measure if it came for a vote, which would make passage even more difficult.\\nDemocrats have also tried - unsuccessfully - to enact nationwide voting rules, as opposed to the current patchwork of state-by-state measures.\\nBut the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act did not make it through Congress under the Biden presidency.\\n'},\n",

After the pursuit, the man got out of his car and an altercation broke out between him and the federal agent, it added.\\n\"While the subject and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,\" the agency had claimed.\\n\"As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broom stick.\"\\nThe DHS statement went on to say: \"Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots.\" The three people then ran into an apartment and were later all arrested, the DHS said.\\nShortly after the incident, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said an agent was \"beat up, he\\'s bruised, he is injured, he\\'s getting treatment, and we\\'re thankful that he made it out alive\".\\nIt was soon followed by a statement on X from US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said: \"Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It\\'s disgusting.\"\\nTwo men, Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, were charged with forcibly assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers in the performance of their official duties.\\nFrom the outset, the official account of the incident was inconsistent. DHS said it was Sosa-Celis who was driving the car then fled on foot but an FBI affidavit said it was Aljorna, the BBC\\'s US partner CBS News reports.\\nThe DHS also scaled back an earlier claim that three people had attacked the immigration agent, as charging documents later stated there were only two individuals involved.\\nSosa-Celis was shot in the leg during the incident.\\nOn Thursday, in an extraordinary reversal, Minnesota\\'s top federal prosecutor Daniel N Rosen asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Aljorna and Sosa-Celis, saying that \"newly discovered evidence in this matter is materially inconsistent with the allegations\".\\nThe US attorney wrote that, as a result, dismissing the case with prejudice - meaning it cannot be refiled - \"will serve the interests of justice\".\\nA judge granted the request on Friday and dismissed the case.\\nFrederick Goetz, a lawyer representing Aljorna, said he was \"delighted\" by the decision to dismiss the charges with prejudice.\\n\"It is my understanding that the video surveillance evidence that captured the incident was materially inconsistent with the federal agent\\'s claims of what happened,\" Goetz said in a statement to CBS News, adding that \"the agent\\'s claims of being assaulted were not backed up by the video evidence\".\\nSosa-Celis\\' lawyer Robin Wolpert said his client was \"a crime victim\".\\n\"These untruthful statements had serious consequences for my client and his family,\" he said.\\nA third Venezuelan man, Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez Ledezma, who lived nearby, was also arrested after the 14 January incident, but a court filing shows he was taken to an ICE detention facility in Texas, and was later returned to Minnesota and released by order of a federal judge.\\nOn Thursday, Trump\\'s border tsar Tom Homan announced that the enforcement surge in Minnesota will end after more than two months.\\nMore than 4,000 undocumented immigrants were arrested during the campaign, he said.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'US President Donald Trump has announced the reversal of the so-called endangerment finding, a key Obama-era scientific ruling that underpins much of US environmental legislation.\\nAs a result of this, experts are predicting various environmental and economic impacts, though the decision by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to be challenged in the courts from environmental groups.\\nHere are some of the potential impacts.\\nThe most obvious outcome of the legislative change is that there will be fewer restrictions placed on greenhouse-gas-producing industries - in particular vehicle manufacturers.\\nThe 2009 endangerment finding was the result of a major report by the EPA, which identified six greenhouse gases, including carbon monoxide and methane, as endangering current and future generations.\\nThe EPA produced the report after a 2007 US Supreme Court decision that it was responsible for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act - with the court ruling it was \"without a doubt\" that these gases counted as air pollutants.\\nGreenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, raising temperatures.\\nThe impact of the ruling until now has been notable. Greenhouse gas levels in the US peaked in the late 2000s and have been on a steady decline in the years since.\\nWith the endangerment finding gone, so is much of the legal basis limiting US industries in the amount of greenhouse gases they are allowed to emit.\\nNon-profit group the Environmental Defense Fund estimates that there will be an additional 7.5-18 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases - three times the amount emitted in a year at present - emitted by 2055.\\nThe effect of this, the group contends, would come at a cost that could potentially run into the trillions of dollars.\\nWhile there has already been a backlash from environmental groups, the Trump administration says removing the endangerment finding will be economically beneficial - particularly when it comes to the cost of vehicles.\\nReversing the finding will reduce automobile manufacturers\\' costs by around $2,400 (£1,760) per car, the White House claimed.\\nSince 2009, the endangerment finding has opened the door to government policies that have boosted fuel efficiency and the number of electric cars on the road. A key policy of Trump\\'s predecessor Joe Biden was the Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivised electric vehicle ownership and renewable energy projects.\\nSince returning to the White House, a number of these policies have already been scrapped by Trump.\\nThursday\\'s change has been welcomed by some in the motor industry.\\nManufacturer Ford told CNBC it would help to address \"the imbalance between current emissions standards and customer choice\", while industry body the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said it would help to \"correct some of the unachievable emissions regulations enacted under the previous administration\".\\nHowever, with climate targets still applicable in many international markets, there are doubts about how much car manufacturers will change production.\\n\"This rollback is sort of cementing things that have already been done, such as the relaxation of the fuel economy standards,\" said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert from Columbia University.\\n\"But it really does put the US automakers in a bind, because nobody else is going to want to buy American cars.\"\\nAs a result of the endangerment finding, a 2011 US Supreme Court ruling placed the power for regulating greenhouse gas emissions with the EPA, taking it out of the hands of the court system.\\nWith the finding gone, legal experts are predicting this will now unravel, leading to a surge in what are called \"public nuisance\" actions.\\nA public nuisance is anything that interferes with the rights of the public - but in environmental cases, it generally refers to something that would interfere with the health and safety of a community.\\nPrior to the 2011 ruling, various court cases were brought by several US states against alleged corporate polluters seeking compensation for that pollution.\\nSo US companies could once again face such legal action.\\n\"This may be another classic case where overreach by the Trump administration comes back to bite it,\" said Robert Percival, a University of Maryland environmental law professor.\\nAnnouncing the end of the endangerment findings, the EPA stated that maintaining greenhouse gas emissions standards was not a requirement to fulfil its \"core mission of protecting human health and the environment\".\\nBut scientists consistently say that pollutants, including greenhouse gases, can cause health problems and premature deaths.\\nThe Environmental Defense Fund estimates that, by 2055, the increase in emissions could lead to between 15,400 and 58,000 premature deaths.\\nIt also estimated that, over the same period, there could potentially be tens of millions more asthma attacks, and tens of thousands more hospital visits.\\nWhile the White House has pointed to the potential savings from removing greenhouse gas restrictions for the automotive industry, Thursday\\'s announcement raises questions about how the US will continue to perform in the global race for renewable energy.\\nThe Biden administration had promoted policies that incentivised domestic renewable technology development, in the hope of the US remaining competitive.\\n\"While the US retreats from clean vehicle standards, the rest of the world is accelerating, and American automakers are falling behind,\" said Margo T Oge, a former head of the EPA, who was in post when the endangerment finding was brought in.\\nShe pointed to a major uptick in the market share for electric vehicles produced by EU and Chinese companies in the past few years.\\n\"If the US abandons its standards, we aren\\'t \\'saving\\' the American auto industry; we are leaving it on an island of obsolete technology,\" Oge wrote in Forbes.\\nThis was a point also made by former US Secretary of State John Kerry.\\n\"China is now producing more wind, more solar than all of the rest of the world put together,\" he said.\\n\"That\\'s what they\\'re doing, they\\'re deploying it. Do you think they\\'ve taken a stupid pill or something yesterday and decided to change their entire economy to meet this new standard?\\n\"No, their population wants clean air.\"\\nDespite the argument that the US could lose ground in terms of renewable energy innovation, the Trump administration points to the economic strain created by regulation.\\nAnnouncing the change on Thursday, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin described it as \"the single largest deregulatory action in US history\" - and said the action was \"saving American taxpayers over $1.3 trillion [£950bn]\".\\nDiana Furchtgott-Roth, who served in the US Department of Transportation during Trump\\'s first term, told the BBC that regulations on emissions had created higher prices and resulted in manufacturing leaving the country.\\n\"It\\'s gone to China, where it\\'s made in a dirtier way,\" she told the BBC.\\n\"So to say that we\\'re reducing global emissions by ending energy intensive manufacturing in some countries, then having it go to China and India, where it\\'s made in a dirtier way, does not reduce global emissions.\"\\nBut Kerry, who also served as US special envoy for climate, said the decision to do away with the endangerment rule will invite enormous damage to people and property all around the world, as climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and severe.\\n\"It\\'s very clear the administration is trading facts and trading science for denial and the wilful negligence that will cost lives and health and countless taxpayers dollars.\"\\n'},\n",

It\\'s like having another older brother!\"\\nThat message came after Epstein offered to buy her a first-class ticket to Europe, according to the BBC\\'s US news partner CBS.\\nHer exit from Goldman follows the release of handwritten notes from a law enforcement official who participated in Epstein\\'s sex trafficking arrest in July 2019.\\nThe notes suggest that, on the night he was taken into custody, Epstein called Ruemmler, whose mobile phone number is redacted in the documents.\\nShe has said she never represented Epstein as a legal client.\\nCommunications from March 2019, four months before Epstein\\'s arrest, show Ruemmler advising him on how to push back against media scrutiny that his 2008 plea deal was too lenient.\\n\"Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offences] of sexual solicitation,\" Ruemmler wrote.\\nShe suggests arguing that Epstein was being persecuted due to his \"wealth\".\\nThe emails also show that Epstein lavished Ruemmler with gifts, including flowers, wine, a Hermès bag, $10,000 (£7,300) in Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and an Apple watch.\\n\"Am totally tricked out by Uncle Jeffrey today!

Police say Van Rootselaar was born a biological male and began transitioning to being female approximately six years ago.\\nThe suspect\\'s mother and step-brother were among the victims. Both were found dead at a local residence, police said.\\nKrauss said Van Rootselaar\\'s family were well-known in the community. \"That family is victimised, too,\" she added, noting that surviving relatives would also be grieving.\\nThe father of the suspect issued a statement on Wednesday night to CBC News in which he offered sympathy to the bereaved and said he was estranged from the suspect.\\n\"To the families who have lost loved ones, and to every person who has been affected by this senseless and unforgivable act of violence, I offer my most heartfelt condolences,\" said Justin Van Rootselaar.\\nPolice have said the suspect\\'s mother and step-brother were shot and killed at the family home first.\\nThe suspect then headed to Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, where police responded to reports of a shooting at around 13:30 local time (21:30 GMT) on Tuesday.\\nInside the school of 160 students, dozens sheltered in classrooms with their teachers as the attack unfolded. Among them was 17-year-old Darian Quist.\\nQuist said he and 15 others hid in their mechanics class, barricading the door with metal tables. At first, they were unsure why they needed to hide, he said. They later learned that there was an active shooter through an alert on their phones.\\nThey hid for over two hours before Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and SWAT officers safely escorted them out.\\nQuist said the shooting had left him and his classmates angry, saddened and shocked. \"That it happened in a place like this, it doesn\\'t seem real,\" he said.\\n\"But I know that it is,\" he added, \"that the people who lost their lives are real.\"\\nOutside the school, parents gathered at a nearby community centre as they anxiously waited to be reunited with their children. Krauss, the pastor, said she went over to support a close friend whose son was at the school.\\nKrauss said her friend later learned that their child was among those who were killed.\\n\"It was devastating, I don\\'t know what else to say,\" she said through tears. \"They are gutted.

It is also known for its picturesque scenery, with tourists drawn to its Unesco-recognised geopark - one of only five in Canada.\\nThat natural beauty is how Bob Zimmer, the federal Conservative member of parliament representing the region, hopes Tumbler Ridge will be remembered, rather than for the tragedy that struck it this week.\\n\"They want to be defined as a beautiful community with beautiful people,\" Zimmer told the BBC. \"But for now, there\\'s a dark cloud. It\\'s just going to take some time to mourn.\"\\nPolice said they had responded to multiple mental health calls involving Van Rootselaar over the years and had seized firearms from the suspect\\'s home before, though they were later returned after a successful petition by the owner.\\nAuthorities did not say who had owned the previously seized guns, nor how the suspect procured the weapons used in the shooting. They said Van Rootselaar had a gun licence that had expired in 2024.\\nZimmer acknowledged that there will be difficult conversations in the aftermath of the shooting, including on whether there is an \"obvious need for more substantial mental health support\".\\nBut for now, he said the community was focused on grieving.\\n\"We\\'re just here to give some hugs and tell [residents] that they are appreciated, and that there\\'s hope,\" Zimmer said.\\n\"But I think there are some serious questions that need to be answered after this.\"\\n'},\n",

In 2026, tariffs will cost the same household $1,300.\\nThe Tax Foundation said even the \"effective\" tariff rate, an average rate that takes into account people buying fewer goods in response to increased prices, is now 9.9%, making it the \"the highest average rate since 1946\".\\nWith such impacts on people, the Tax Foundation said any economic benefits of tax cuts included in Trump\\'s \"Big Beautiful Bill\" will be offset entirely.\\n'},\n",

It wasn\\'t in my universe.\"\\nHis difficulties are an indication of a wider freeze in the US labour market, where job openings and hiring rates have dropped to multi-year lows.\\nLast year the US added an average of just 15,000 jobs a month, very few by historic standards.\\nThe employment slowdown has raised concern about the health of the economy, but evidence of wider deterioration is elusive.\\nLayoffs have remained limited, apart from some high-profile cuts at firms such as Amazon and UPS and the unemployment rate has held steady at around 4.3%. Meanwhile, the wider economy continues to grow, expanding at a robust annual pace of 4.4% in the most recent figures.\\nIt\\'s a puzzling, and unusual, mix.\\n\"It\\'s actually very hard to point to another moment in the last 25 years where you have the combination we see today,\" said Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\\nTrigg said he was \"battening down the hatches\" and hoping that whatever is causing the situation will pass.\\nBut there are growing questions about whether the challenges he is facing could be here to stay.\\nLast October the investment bank Goldman Sachs put out a report, which was widely cited, suggesting the US could be facing a new period of \"jobless growth\" thanks to the arrival of new technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in particular, allowing companies to do more with fewer workers.\\nConcerns about the wider implications of such a change pulsed through discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month and have contributed to widespread economic anxiety in the US.\\nEconomics professor Constantin Burgi of University College, Dublin, said a decoupling of job gains and wider growth - like the one the US is seeing today - often occurs when an economy goes through a structural shift, like the advent of AI.\\nHe noted while AI\\'s promise remains hotly debated, technology has also made outsourcing even easier.\\nIn Burgi\\'s view the situation is likely temporary – but that does not mean it will be short-lived.\\n\"It can be a couple of months but it can also be a couple of years,\" he said. \"If the jobs are really lost due to outsourcing or AI, then unless we find in a couple of years actually we still need those people and replacing them didn\\'t work, then those jobs are gone.\"\\nFor those in the trenches looking for work, the search is demoralising, regardless of its cause.\\nJames Richardson, a 33-year-old from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said without help from his parents, he would be homeless. He has applied to more than 1,200 jobs since being let go from his role as an information security analyst for a government contractor in October.\\nSometimes his application is rejected within 15 minutes of submission, he said.\\n\"It feels like there is no-one on the other side even bothering to take a look at your experiences and credentials.\"\\nIt remains unclear whether the jobs slowdown is actually due solely or even mostly to technological change.\\nResearch suggests job losses due to AI have remained concentrated to just a few sectors.\\nAnd many US firms, especially in tech, still have on their payrolls a glut of workers who were brought on during the pandemic, when there was a small hiring boom. That could also help explain the lack of new vacancies.\\nThe Trump administration\\'s crackdown on immigration is also curbing population growth. That makes it harder to find workers, but it also means fewer are needed.\\nLaura Ullrich, director of economic research at Indeed, said in her view another reason hiring appetites took a hit last year was the uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration\\'s cuts to government spending and his programme of tariffs.\\nAssuming the economy remains strong, she does not think the new jobs numbers will stay this low.\\n\"I would definitely not call it a new normal, because I don\\'t think it\\'s normal,\" she said. \"I don\\'t think you can sustain the kind of labour market that we\\'re in over the long term.\\n\"Having a very low-hire, low-fire, low-quits environment in a period of economic growth can only last so long.\"\\nStronger-than-expected job gains in January could be a sign that hope is on the horizon for job seekers.\\nBut there are plenty of wild cards ahead, as Ullrich and others are quick to acknowledge.\\nAs the economy grows increasingly reliant on spending by the very wealthy, it has also become more vulnerable to a sudden downward correction in share prices.\\nAI could prove as transformative as its most optimistic backers are predicting.\\nOr the US could enter a period of lower growth, if restricting immigration takes the wind out of the economy.\\nAmy Beson, who was laid off in April as part of wider job cuts at the University of Arizona, said she was not expecting things to improve anytime soon.\\nUniversities have seen funding cuts from the government, making it harder for the 47-year-old to find the kind of work that used to be supported by grant programmes.\\nMeanwhile, she fears competition from the ranks of newly unemployed government workers.\\nEven expanding her search to healthcare, where she previously worked and which is considered one of the economy\\'s most resilient sectors, has not helped.\\n\"It definitely is the most desperate I\\'ve ever felt,\" she said. \"I do worry that this is the new normal.\"\\nReporting contributed by World Business Express\\n'},\n",

The president said he was revoking an Obama-era \"endangerment finding\" from 2009 which held that pollution harms public health and the environment.\\nFor almost 17 years, the US has used that scientific finding as the legal basis to establish policies to reduce emissions from cars, power plants and other sources of planet-warming gases.\\n\"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam,\" Trump said, using a term popular with Republicans for describing Democratic environmental and climate policies.\\nThe move marks the culmination of a decade-long push by Trump to tear up policies that Democrats and many climate experts say are needed to rein in emissions. And it is one of the most far-reaching reversals of American climate policy yet.\\nTrump, who has called climate change a \"hoax\" and a \"con job\", dismissed the science underpinning the Obama-era rule in remarks that at times took on the air of a victory lap over his Democratic opponents.\\nIt was yet another sign that, for the president, this issue is as much a political one as it is scientific.\\nHe focused on the economic impacts of reversing the endangerment finding, arguing that boosting fossil fuels instead of clean energy would lead to lower energy costs for American consumers.\\nTrump also singled out the US auto industry as a major beneficiary of the change.\\nHe said ending the endangerment finding would do away with an electric vehicle \"mandate\" put in place by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Under Biden, Congress passed a law to expand the nation\\'s electric vehicle charging network and created tax incentives to lower the cost of EVs, but it did not include any provisions forcing buyers to purchase them.\\nLee Zeldin, the administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency, made the announcement alongside the president and described the 2009 scientific ruling as the \"holy grail of climate change religion\".\\nBoth men framed its revocation as an assault on overbearing federal regulations - part of a longtime message from Republicans that bureaucratic red tape is hindering economic growth.\\nZeldin said past climate policies had \"strangled entire sectors of the United States economy\".\\nThis decision is \"the single largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States of America,\" he said.\\nThe rollback sparked fury, meanwhile, among Democrats and environmental groups who said it would wreck the US\\'s ability to combat climate change. \"We\\'ll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change - all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money,\" former President Barack Obama wrote on social media.\\nTrump reversed numerous Obama-era energy and environmental regulations in his first term in office. He also withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord, an agreement by countries around the world to lower emissions and address rising sea levels, natural disasters and other problems exacerbated by global warming.\\nTrump repeated the action at the start of his second term, reversing Biden\\'s decision to reinstate the US in the international climate pact.\\nIn recent years, climate policy in the US has swung wildly depending on who is occupying the White House. But the announcement on Thursday represented the largest move yet by Trump to dismantle the climate policies put in place by his Democratic predecessors.\\nIt also revived a campaign trail fight from the past few national elections, which pitted Trump against Democrats in Congress who backed wide-ranging climate and environmental policies known as the \"Green New Deal\".\\nWhether the strategy of climate rollbacks can help Republicans pick up votes in the November midterm elections, which will decide control of Congress for the rest of Trump\\'s term, remains to be seen.\\nThe issue rarely appeared as a top priority for voters in exit polls in the 2024 presidential election - with the economy and cost of living frequently ranking top.\\nPerhaps with this in mind, Trump took pains to argue Thursday\\'s move would save consumers thousands on a new car. Many environmentalists, however, are sceptical of this claim.\\nTrump and many Republicans have also argued that Democrats\\' climate policies are extreme and out-of-touch with public sentiment.\\n\\nBut opinion polls indicate a growing percentage of Americans are worried about global warming - a potential warning sign for Republicans who embrace Trump\\'s climate record in November.\\nIn the US, 63% of Americans say they are worried about global warming, compared to 37% who say they are not worried, according to a 2024 study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.\\nA 2025 Gallup poll indicated that a record 48% of American adults think global warming will pose a serious threat in their lifetime, up from 25% in 1997.\\nAt the White House on Thursday, Trump dismissed a question about whether he was concerned his decision would be unpopular with the public. He argued that the country would be better off without the climate change regulations of the past.\\nThat era is \"dead, gone, over\", he said.\\n'},\n",

A grand jury this week declined to bring charges of seditious conspiracy against them.\\nReducing Kelly\\'s rank could lead to a major cut in his retirement pay.\\nKelly, who is also a former astronaut, sued the government in January, naming Hegseth as the defendant. He argued that Hegseth had illegally tried to demote him in retaliation for criticising the Trump administration. He asked the judge to block the demotion with a temporary injunction while his lawsuit proceeded.\\nThe federal government had argued Kelly should contest the case against him through a military process and not in a civilian court of law, but in Thursday\\'s decision, Judge Leon wrote: \"I disagree.\"\\nLeon wrote that while service members have more limited free speech protections than civilians under the US Constitution\\'s first amendment, no court has ever extended those limits to retired service members.\\n\"This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly\\'s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,\" he wrote. \"To say the least, our retired veterans deserve more respect from their Government, and our Constitution demands they receive it!\"\\nSoon after the judge issued the temporary injunction, Hegseth posted on X: \"This will be immediately appealed. Sedition is sedition, \\'Captain.\\'\"\\nIn a statement, Kelly said that he appreciated \"the judge\\'s careful consideration of this case, and the clarity of his ruling\".\\n\"But I also know that this might not be over yet,\" he added, saying he was ready to keep fighting the Trump administration.\\nIn the video, the six Democratic lawmakers say that the administration \"is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens\".\\nKelly appears alongside Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin and US Representatives Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow, all of whom served in military or intelligence agencies.\\n\"Our laws are clear,\" he says. \"You can refuse illegal orders.\"\\nAfter the video was released, Trump posted on social media that the members of Congress should be arrested and put on trial. Labeling the video seditious behaviour, he posted: \"PUNISHABLE BY DEATH!\"\\nTrump later clarified to Fox News: \"I\\'m not threatening death, but I think they\\'re in serious trouble.\"\\nFederal prosecutors then began criminal investigations into the lawmakers and sought to indict them on charges of seditious conspiracy. But a grand jury, which decides if a case can stand up on court, declined to approve the charges.\\nMeanwhile, Hegseth announced he would open retirement-grade determination proceedings against Kelly and issue a formal letter of censure. He described Kelly\\'s comments as \"seditious in nature\" and a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\\nIn his decision, which contained more exclamation marks than are typical in judicial writings, Leon wrote: \"Rather than trying to shrink the First Amendment liberties of retired servicemembers, Secretary Hegseth and his fellow Defendants might reflect and be grateful for the wisdom and expertise that retired servicemembers have brought to public discussions and debate on military matters in our Nation over the past 250 years.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The US immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota will end, President Donald Trump\\'s border tsar told reporters on Thursday.\\nTom Homan said Trump had approved his request to conclude the operation, adding he would stay in Minnesota \"a little longer to oversee the drawdown, to ensure its success\".\\nHoman said Operation Metro Surge had resulted in many illegal immigrants who had committed violent crimes being detained for deportation. But the surge also sparked nationwide protests when two US citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were killed by immigration officers.\\nAfter the news conference, top Minnesota and federal officials appeared at a Capitol Hill hearing on Trump\\'s immigration crackdown.\\nOfficials in Minnesota have been able to \"greatly reduce the number of targets\" for immigration enforcement, Homan said, adding that Operation Metro Surge was a \"great success\".\\nMore than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to Homan, including men he said were convicted of rape and other sexual misconduct.\\nHoman said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has always had a presence in Minnesota and will continue to have one.\\nHe said that the surge\\'s end came after an unprecedented level of cooperation between federal agents and local law enforcement, with local officials increasing their crackdown on protesters he called public safety threats and local jails more willing to notify ICE of the release dates for individuals it was seeking.\\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz said at a news conference following Homan\\'s announcement that he was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the drawdown of federal agents.\\n\"The fact of the matter is they left us with deep damage, generational trauma,\" Walz said. \"They left us with economic ruin in some cases. They left us with many unanswered questions.\"\\nThe governor is expected to soon propose a $10m (£7m) emergency fund for small businesses who say they were financially hurt by the surge.\\nFollowing the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti last month, President Donald Trump dispatched Homan to Minneapolis to oversee the surge, sidelining the operation\\'s leader, Greg Bovino, who had faced intense criticism for ICE\\'s use of force and what many in the city alleged were civil rights violations.\\nTrump\\'s immigration crackdown has faced resistance in Democrat-led cities like Minneapolis from activists in the streets and local officials and immigrants in the courts. The administration last month finished removing National Guard troops from Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago - places where there had been large protests against the presence of troops and immigration agents - according to US Northern Command.\\nSome Republicans, too, had questioned the Minneapolis operation.\\nSenator Rand Paul told a committee hearing with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials on Thursday that \"saying we\\'re going to reduce this presence in the street is a good sign and a good step forward\".\\n\"I\\'m glad that\\'s happening,\" the Republican from Kentucky said. \"I think that is de-escalation.\"\\nICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said at the hearing that the agency is tracking roughly 1.6 million undocumented immigrants with deportation orders in the US, including roughly 800,000 who have criminal convictions.\\nHe also defended against accusations from lawmakers that the agency was not holding officers accountable, saying ICE had launched 37 open investigations for excessive use of force since January 2025.\\nThe fight over how immigration agents operate has now put the federal government at risk of a partial shutdown as Congress debates a funding measure for the DHS, which includes ICE.\\nOn Thursday, the US Senate failed to advance a bill on new funding for the department. Earlier this month, lawmakers approved DHS funding for two weeks and had planned to use that time to negotiate a substantive deal.\\nBut with no agreement in sight and the upper chamber set to go on break, DHS could lose its funding starting Saturday. That will affect a variety of services, including transportation security at US airports and responses to disasters and large-scale emergencies. Last year, lawmakers passed legislation creating a separate pool of funding that should allow ICE to continue to operate.\\nDemocrats are demanding changes in ICE - such as ending the wearing of masks - in exchange for support for the bill. They are also pushing for immigration agents in Minnesota and elsewhere to be required to reveal their identities and to end warrant-less searches.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'US Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the justice department\\'s handling of the files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and faced a barrage of angry questions on other issues during a fiery congressional hearing on Wednesday.\\nHer testimony before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee descended at times into a shouting match, with Bondi at one point calling a Democrat a \"washed-up loser\". After another heated exchange, one lawmaker stormed out.\\nHere are some of the key exchanges from the four-hour hearing.\\nThe hearing followed the release by the justice department earlier this year of millions more files from its investigations into the well-connected paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\\nSeveral of Epstein\\'s victims were seated behind Bondi at the hearing, and lawmakers frequently referred to them.\\nIn her opening statement, Bondi called Epstein a \"monster\" and told the victims she was sorry for the abuse they endured.\\nBut lawmakers directed a litany of complaints at Bondi about how the justice department has handled its release of the files. Several criticised what they said was a failure to redact the names of victims as required by law.\\nDemocratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said that in some cases \"nude images\" of survivors were released, some of whom had their identities protected \"for decades\".\\nJayapal asked survivors in the room to stand and raise their hand if they had not been able to meet with the justice department, which led all of them to rise.\\nJayapal then urged Bondi to apologise to the victims for the justice department\\'s handling of redactions.\\nBondi fired back, describing Jayapal\\'s questioning as \"theatrics\" and adding: \"I\\'m not going to get in the gutter with this woman.\"\\nThe attorney general said at another point during the hearing that officials were doing their best to protect victims in the timeframe allotted by the legislation that required the files to be released. She said any names brought to them that have been released \"inadvertently\" have been \"immediately redacted\".\\nBondi also faced questions on Epstein\\'s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who after a meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche was moved from a \"low-security\" Florida prison to a \"minimum security\" all-women Texas prison camp.\\n\"She needs to be moved back to a maximum security prison as soon as possible,\" one Democrat, Deborah Ross, said to Bondi.\\nBondi said it was a question for the Bureau of Prisons, and she only learned about the transfer after the fact. She said Maxwell \"will hopefully die in prison\".\\nMarina Lacerda, an Epstein survivor who attended the hearing, told the BBC that Bondi has been unwilling to help survivors.\\n\"She hasn\\'t taken any of our calls. She hasn\\'t taken any of our emails. She has totally ignored us, just like she did today,\" said Lacerda.\\nShe also accused Bondi and the justice department of trying to \"intimidate us\" into silence.\\nThe hearing turned tense over names in the Epstein files that had been redacted, too.\\nA bipartisan group of US lawmakers has accused the justice department of improperly removing the names of people from the files who are not protected.\\nThey have been allowed to review unredacted versions of the files, which has since led the justice department to unredact names in at least one document.\\nThomas Massie, a Republican who has been involved in these efforts, told Bondi he wanted to know who was responsible for the redactions and whether anybody will be held accountable for the \"failure\".\\nMassie went on to say that this issue is \"bigger than Watergate\" and spanned numerous US administrations.\\n\"This is a political joke,\" Bondi said as Massie continued to press her on why some people\\'s names, including billionaire Les Wexner, had been blacked out from the files initially.\\nWexner has previously alleged that Epstein stole millions of dollars from him while working as his financial adviser.\\nA legal representative for Wexner told the BBC: \"The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner\\'s legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.\\n\"Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.\"\\nDuring discussion of the Epstein files, California Democratic congressman Ted Lieu mentioned Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who is facing growing pressure from officials and the family of his prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre to testify in the US.\\nAndrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 containing no admission of liability.\\nLieu had the hearing display a picture of the former prince from the Epstein files, which shows Mountbatten-Windsor on all fours hovering over a female. No context has been supplied for the photos.\\nIt is unclear when and where they were taken and the picture itself does not indicate criminality.\\nLieu asked why the photos had not been used to prosecute Mountbatten-Windsor. Bondi responded by asking why Lieu did not bring those questions to former Attorney General Merrick Garland.\\n\"I agree with you,\" said Lieu, adding Garland \"dropped the ball\".\\nWhile the Epstein files took centre stage during the hearing, Bondi was also pressed by lawmakers on federal immigration agents fatally shooting two people during confrontations in Minneapolis, which sparked nationwide demonstrations.\\nTennessee Democratic congressman Steve Cohen told Bondi the shootings were \"executions\" that the justice department did not investigate.\\nBondi defended the federal government\\'s actions in Minnesota, saying protesters and federal agents had been incited by elected officials, whom she claimed have obstructed law enforcement and declared themselves \"at war\" with the federal government.\\nOther Republicans joined in to defend her, including the committee chairman, congressman Jim Jordan, who praised how Bondi had implemented President Trump\\'s crackdown on illegal immigration.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The sudden and unexpected closure of the airspace over El Paso, Texas, appears to have stemmed from the US federal government conducting drone-related tests.\\nThe 10-day closure, which ultimately ended hours after it was announced late Tuesday, caused a mass panic in the US-Mexico border city, with the mayor telling the BBC that the chaos \"was completely unnecessary\".\\nThe US Department of Defense said the airspace issue was due to the military disabling drones being used by Mexican cartels.\\nBut CBS News, the BBC\\'s news partner, said the closure followed a test earlier this week, where an energy laser was used to shoot down what appeared to be a foreign drone, but was actually a party balloon.\\n\"Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace. The Department of War took action to disable the drones,\" a Trump administration official said after the area reopened Wednesday morning.\\nCiting multiple sources close to the matter, CBS reported the Pentagon had planned to test new military technology - reportedly a high-energy laser - to practice taking down drones near a military base next to the El Paso airport.\\nMeetings to discuss the technology\\'s safety were scheduled with the FAA, but the defence department wanted to test it sooner, prompting the FAA - which regulates airspace safety - to halt flights, according to CBS.\\nHours after the announced airspace closure, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted on X that the FAA had worked with the Pentagon to \"address a cartel drone incursion\" and the \"restrictions have been lifted\".\\nThe BBC has not independently confirmed the reported dispute between the military and the FAA. The Pentagon declined to comment when contacted by the BBC, and a Trump administration official told the BBC that it is \"in lockstep to safeguard America\\'s national security and southern border against all foreign intrusions\".\\nThe Associated Press, New York Times and other US media on Wednesday published similar reports.\\nCBS reported that cartels have been using drones on the border lately but it was unclear whether the military had downed any yet using the technology that was being tested.\\nEl Paso Mayor Renard Johnson told the BBC that the city was not notified in advance about the 10-day closure, and that it spark fears from residents of a potential military conflict brewing.\\n\"We haven\\'t had flight restrictions like this since 9/11,\" he said, referring to the terror attacks on 11 September 2001, which shut down airspace across the entire US, and led to the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.\\n\"And keep in mind, in 9/11, we were only shut down at the airport for two days.\"\\nRenard added that it is still unclear to residents and city leaders why the airspace was closed, and that they have received no explanation from the FAA.\\n\"What they were doing caused complete chaos,\" he said, adding: \"People were confused. They didn\\'t know what to do.\"\\nIn an earlier news conference, the mayor said that medical evacuation flights were diverted because of the closure. Another flight that was carrying surgical equipment \"did not show up here in El Paso\".\\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters on Wednesday that her government had \"no information indicating drone activity at the border\".\\n\"If the FAA or any US government agency has relevant information, they can ask directly the Government of Mexico,\" she said.\\nLong-term airspace closures are rare. Since 2018, the FAA has cut airspace closures from an average of more than four hours per launch to just more than two hours, according to its web site.\\nThe restriction covered a 10-mile radius around El Paso, including parts of southern New Mexico, west of the town San Teresa.\\nAfter the initial closure, El Paso International Airport said in a statement it was told \"on short notice\" to halt all flights and contacted the FAA for more information.\\nCity Council member Chris Canales, who represents an area on the southwestern side of El Paso, told the BBC, \"The notice was published without any advance notice to local governments or to local air traffic controllers.\"\\nThe cancellations were so abrupt that people reported being told by airlines that their flights were still scheduled, even after the FAA\\'s announcement.\\n\"Just called (United Airlines) about my flight this morning and they said it\\'s still scheduled to leave???\" one woman commented on Instagram early Wednesday.\\nSome on social media speculated about broader conspiracy theories and wondered if the US was on the brink of war.\\n\"It is significant that the US shut down a major airport,\" Mick Mulroy, a former US Marine, CIA paramilitary officer and deputy assistant secretary of defense told the BBC.\\n\"If the purpose was for counter drone activity related to cartel drones, it makes sense as the primary means to do so is through electronic warfare (EW),\" he added. \"EW poses a real risk to civilian aviation. Therefore it was prudent to do so.\"\\nMulroy said the alleged cartel drones were most likely being used for surveillance and \"not anything offensive\".\\nMexico\\'s Ciudad Juarez is just south and west of El Paso, and US Army base Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range lie to the north.\\nFort Bliss is a military post focused on training and White Sands Missile Range is the country\\'s largest overland testing range for missiles, rockets and advanced weapons.\\nIn Mexico\\'s interior, cartels have used drones to drop explosives on rivals or security forces, and one cartel, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has a specialised drone unit.\\nBut along the border, drones are used primarily to help cartels gather intelligence and mostly for human smuggling operations.\\n\"They monitor the position of Border Patrol agents and relay that to migrants to direct them across the border,\" said Parker Asmann, an expert in Mexican cartels at the Washington-based think tank Insight Crime. \"It\\'s about gathering intelligence, surveillance and doing reconnaissance.\"\\nIn the El Paso area, which Asmann called a \"hub\" for human trafficking, drones are a \"newer\" technology performing work that would have previously been done mostly by \"spotters\" in the hills.\\nDrone activity in the area, however, is extremely regular, and it remains unclear why the reported incursion on Wednesday prompted a sudden and large-scale airspace closure.\\nMayor Renard said its common for unauthorised drones to fly in the area.\\n\"I don\\'t think this is the first time a drone has entered the airspace. And I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be the last time,\" he said.\\n\"You cannot shut down a major city in the United States for 10 days. That is completely unacceptable.\\n\"For a couple of hours, if they were doing a test, we can completely understand that. But you can\\'t come in and say, \\'oh by the way we\\'re gonna be shut down for that many days\\',\" he continued.\\n\"A drone does not rise to the level of 9/11.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The US House of Representatives has voted to rescind US President Donald Trump\\'s tariffs on Canadian goods.\\nIn a 219 to 211 vote, six Republican lawmakers joined Democrats to back a resolution that seeks to end the tariffs Trump imposed on Canada last year.\\nThe vote is largely symbolic as it will still need to be approved by the US Senate and then approved by Trump, who is very unlikely to sign it into law.\\nSince his re-election, Donald Trump has imposed a series of tariffs on Canada, recently threatening a 100% import tax in response to Canada\\'s proposed trade deal with China.\\nAs the vote was taking place on the House floor, Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time.\"\\n\"TARIFFS have given us Economic and National Security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege,\" he added.\\nThe vote came after US House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally in Congress, unsuccessfully tried to block discussion on the chamber\\'s floor by lawmakers on Trump\\'s tariffs.\\nWith Republicans holding a thin majority in the US House, the six Republican defections along with a near-united front from Democrats was enough to secure the votes.\\nThe measure had been introduced by Democrat Gregory Meeks who said that Trump had \"weaponized tariffs\" against allies and destabilized the global economy.\\n\"Not only have these tariffs done immense harm to our relationship with Canada, pushing them closer to China, they have driven up prices here at home,\" he said before the vote.\\nRepresentative Don Bacon from Nebraska was one of the six Republicans who crossed the aisle to join Democrats in approving the measure. Before the vote, he said \"tariffs have been a \\'net negative\\' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying.\"\\nThe bill now heads to the US Senate where Republicans also hold the majority. Even if it cleared that hurdle, it is unlikely to be signed into law.\\nSeparately, Trump\\'s tariffs are also facing legal scrutiny as the US Supreme Court is set to rule soon on a case questioning the president\\'s legal authority to impose the levies.\\nMeeks, the top Democrat on the US House Foreign Affairs committee, said the measure on Canada is the first of several bills he plans to introduce that aim to roll back Trump\\'s signature trade action.\\n\"Our fight doesn\\'t stop here,\" he said in a video posted online before the vote. \"I have resolutions also to end trump\\'s tariffs on Mexico, on Brazil, and on his Liberation Day global tariffs.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'People in the small Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge have reacted with shock and disbelief after nine people were killed and at least 25 wounded in a shooting at a local secondary school and home.\\nMembers of the remote community, 415 miles (667 km) northeast of the western city of Vancouver, spoke of their fear and uncertainty during the school lockdown, as no-one appeared to be aware of the magnitude of what was unfolding.\\nThey described how close the community of just 2500 people was, and how devastated it would be by what had happened.\\n\"I will know every victim. I\\'ve been here 19 years, and we\\'re a small community,\" town mayor Darryl Krakowka told Canadian broadcaster CBC.\\n\"I don\\'t call them residents. I call them family,\" he added.\\nChris Norbury, a town councillor, was as close as anyone in Tumbler Ridge to the shooting. His wife teaches at the secondary school, his daughter attends the nearby elementary school and he works at the visitor centre just a block away.\\nSpeaking to the BBC World Service\\'s Newsday programme, he explained how scared and anxious he felt as he waited for news of his wife.\\nHe first realised something was wrong when his daughter\\'s school called him to say they were in lockdown. He was able to contact his wife, who was also under lockdown, but by the time he found out - from an emergency alert - that there was an active shooter, he was unable to contact her again.\\n\"We just had to speculate and jump into social media to see what was going on - there was a lot of speculation... but being who I am I just wanted to stay calm as best I could and wait for the facts,\" Norbury said.\\nThat proved far from easy, though.\\n\"It was terrifying, it\\'s hard to put into words the dread and the fear that you feel knowing that a loved one is in danger,\" he said.\\nMeanwhile he was able to see emergency vehicles, including helicopters, coming and going from the school and a nearby medical centre.\\nThat feeling of helplessness and of not knowing what was happening was felt by those within the school too.\\nOne father told the BBC his son was there while the shooting took place.\\nThe child and his friends were busy studying in their classroom when \"all of a sudden they heard gunshots going off\", the father said.\\n\"They were huddled in a corner of the classroom for two to three hours. It felt a lot lot longer.\\nSome of the students were \"really freaking out and crying\", the father said.\\n\"My son was trying to console them. He tried to stay as calm as he could, but he is pretty shaken up, and he is scared... He didn\\'t know where the gunshots were coming from.\"\\nThe boy told his dad it was a terrifying experience, and they didn\\'t know what was going on. Luckily he was unharmed, but he is still waiting to hear information about some of his friends.\\n\"I\\'m just so thankful that I didn\\'t have to bury my kid,\" the father told the BBC.\\nDarian Quist, a grade 12 student at the school, was in a classroom with a teacher and about 15 students when the lockdown alarm sounded, though he believes he was in a different part of the school from the shooting. He and his classmates stayed there until the police escorted them out.\\n\"For a while I didn\\'t think anything was going on, but once everything was circulating and we realised something was wrong we got tables and barricaded the doors, and I believe we sat in there for two or two-and-a-half hours,\" he told CBC.\\nHe said everyone was tense and nervous. People sent him \"disturbing\" photos, he said, with \"blood and things like that\".\\n\"I think that\\'s when it all set in,\" he said.\\nHis mother Shelley Quist was working at the local hospital at the time. She said they only found out about the shooter half an hour after the lockdown - though she was on the phone with her son the whole time.\\n\"It\\'s just one of those things when you just think it\\'s never going to happen,\" she said, adding: \"Panic was setting in until I laid eyes on [Darian].\"\\nNorbury said that it wasn\\'t until after 17:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after the lockdown was first announced - that people started to be released from the school and he was able to find out that his wife was safe.\\nQuist described the departure as \"organised chaos\". \"Professionalism definitely took hold,\" he said.\\nBut even then those involved did not know the full extent of what had happened until the casualty figures were revealed.\\n\"A lot of people are shaken up right now, especially when we were told the true numbers,\" Darian Quist said.\\nThough the names of the victims have not yet been released, it is clear the whole town has been deeply affected.\\n\\nAre you in Tumbler Ridge? Share your experiences here\\nNorbury said he believed he may have known some of the children involved.\\n\"I was a children\\'s librarian for 10 years, and knowing that these children that I likely knew, that I likely read to... these are our friends, our friends\\' children have been injured, lost their life, and we just have to think how to come together as a community and rely upon each other for support,\" he said.\\nHe added: \"Crime is incredibly low here, we\\'ve never had anything like this before. It\\'s an incredible shock that anything like this could happen. We\\'re such a tight-knit community, we\\'re really like a family here.\"\\nNorbury also reflected on the effect the shooting would have on the community in the future.\\n\"How many people will be afraid to go to school? How many will this affect for the rest of their lives? And it absolutely will, that\\'s my fear,\" he said.\\n\"If I could talk to those people, I\\'d say, don\\'t let this define you. Please get help when you need help. We are strong and we are resilient and we will get through this\".\\n'},\n",

Pitt, 62, stars as veteran driver, Sonny Hayes, who returns to the Formula 1 grid with the fictional team APXGP after a long absence.\\nSpeculation about a possible sequel has been circulating for months but had not previously been confirmed, including during Apple TV\\'s press day last week, where the film is streaming.\\nSpeaking to the BBC at the annual Academy Awards luncheon in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Bruckheimer said: \"We\\'re working on a sequel.\"\\nThe producer declined to give a timeline for the project or confirm casting details, including whether Pitt would reprise his role.

       "  'Article': 'The list of some of the world\\'s most rich and powerful people with ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has lengthened, after the US government released millions of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier.\\nThere is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing. Many people who have featured in previous releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\\nHere is a list of some of the people mentioned in the latest release.\\nThe documents include email correspondence between Epstein and tech billionaire Elon Musk over travel plans Epstein appeared to be arranging, although Musk has said he has never visited Epstein\\'s private island.\\nIn November 2012, Musk wrote in one email: \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"\\nIn another, from December the same year, he wrote: \"I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose\", adding that a \"peaceful island experience\" is the opposite of what he\\'s wanting.\\nResponse: Musk responded in an X post in January, acknowledging that the emails might be used to \"smear my name\", but said he was more concerned about the prosecution of \"those who committed serious crimes with Epstein\".\\nTwo emails from 18 July 2013 are written as though drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they are genuine or were ever sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.\\nOne email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates \"to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls\".\\nIn an interview with NPR, his ex-wife Melinda said the release of the documents brought up memories of their marital struggles.\\n\"I\\'m able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, my God, how did that happen to those girls?\" she said.\\n\"At least for me, I\\'ve been able to move on in life, and I hope there\\'s some justice for those now-women.\"\\nResponse: A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: \"These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.\"\\n\\nThe US president is mentioned many times in the newly released files, which includes a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line.\\nMany of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence.\\nThe list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures.\\nResponse: Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein\\'s victims.\\nPhotographs appearing to show Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground have also been included in the latest Epstein files release.\\nIn two of the images, the former prince is seen touching the person, who is unidentified and fully clothed, on her stomach. Another image shows him staring directly at the camera.\\nNo context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken.\\nResponse: BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\\nRichard Branson\\'s name appears many times in the files.\\nIn one 2013 exchange, Epstein thanks Branson for his recent hospitality and public relations advice, to which Branson replies that it was \"really nice\" seeing him, adding: \"Any time you\\'re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!\"\\nVirgin Group has clarified that \"harem\" referred to three adult members of Epstein\\'s team.\\nResponse: In a statement to the BBC, Virgin Group said Branson\\'s contact with Epstein was \"only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event\".\\nThe statement added: \"When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations.\\n\"As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again. Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever – Richard believes that Epstein\\'s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims.\"\\nSarah Ferguson, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor\\'s ex-wife, who is invariably known as Fergie, appears to also be mentioned in multiple emails, including when Epstein was still under house arrest.\\nAn email from an account believed to belong to Epstein says: \"I think Fergie can now say, I am not a pedo.\"\\nIn another email exchange from April 2009 there is a request to meet Epstein for a \"quick cup of tea\", that includes the lines: \"My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you.\"\\nResponse: The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response.\\nEpstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released in the files suggest, including to his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva.\\nThe Metropolitan Police has launched a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.\\nIn 2009, one year after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor, da Silva sent an email requesting \"anything you can help me with\".\\nEpstein replied: \"I will wire your loan amount immediately\".\\nA separate email exchange appears to show Epstein arranging a place for Mandelson to stay at one of his New York apartments, with Epstein writing, \"thrilled to host and sad I\\'m not there\".\\nResponse: Lord Mandelson has said he will step down from the House of Lords. On Sunday, Mandelson reiterated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\" and for continuing his association following Epstein\\'s conviction. He has told the BBC he \"was never culpable or complicit in (Epstein\\'s) crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death\". He has not responded to the allegations of leaking documents, but BBC understands that he maintains he did not act criminally and did not act for personal gain. He argues that he sought Epstein\\'s expertise in the national interest during the 2008 global financial crisis.\\nThe files also contain many messages that appear to be sent between the late convicted sex offender and one of Trump\\'s former top advisers, Steve Bannon.\\nMost messages were sent in 2018 and 2019 after Bannon left his role in the first Trump White House, as he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death.\\nOne text exchange shows Bannon apparently strategising with Epstein on how to change the narrative around his past crimes, suggesting \"first we need to push back on the lies\" and \"rebuild your image as philanthropist\".\\nResponse: Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.\\nAn October 2018 text exchange between Miroslav Lajčák - who was serving as Slovakia\\'s foreign minister at the time - and Epstein appeared to show the two messaging about girls and diplomacy.\\nAfter Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: \"Why don\\'t you invite me for these games? I would take the \\'MI\\' girl.\"\\n\"Who wouldn\\'t,\" Epstein texts back. \"You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters.\"\\nResponse: Following the latest release of Epstein-related documents, Lajčák resigned from his current post as Slovakia\\'s national security advisor. He is not accused of any wrongdoing.\\nUS Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick brought his family to visit Jeffrey Epstein\\'s private island in 2012, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files\\' release, contradicting previous claims that he had cut ties with him years earlier.\\nIn one email from December 2012, Lutnick\\'s wife Allison wrote to Epstein\\'s assistant on what appeared to be the eve of the visit: \"We are looking forward to visiting you\", and, \"We would love to join you for lunch\".\\nDuring congressional testimony in February 2026, Lutnick confirmed the visit publicly for the first time, saying he spent about an hour on the island, along with his wife, four children, and their nannies. He previously said he cut off contact with Epstein in 2005.\\nResponse: Lutnick told lawmakers that he was in the region for a vacation, and that in the years since the visit, \"I barely had anything to do with\" Epstein. He also acknowledged another one-hour meeting with Epstein, which took place a year and a half after the island visit.\\nThe commerce department said in a statement to the BBC that \"Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing\".\\nLarry Summers, US President Bill Clinton\\'s former treasury secretary and former Harvard University president, is also in the new documents, including references to meetings and dinners between Summers and Epstein.\\nIn emails from 2017, Summers and Epstein joked about Trump and criticised him during his first term.\\n\"Your world does not understand how dumb he really is,\" Epstein said of Trump in one email to Summers.\\nResponse: After Summers was mentioned amid a batch of Epstein files released in November, he said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\" and resigned from multiple posts, including his role on the advisory board of OpenAI.\\nSteve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, is shown in the release of Epstein-related documents inquiring about a woman he met at Epstein\\'s house.\\nIn one email exchange, Tisch asked whether the woman was a professional or a \"civilian\".\\nIn other exchanges, Epstein tells Tisch he had a \"present\" for him and described a woman he would introduce Tisch to as \"tahitian speaks mostly french, exotic\".\\nResponse: In a statement to CNN, Tisch said he and Epstein \"had a brief association\", adding that he \"did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island\".\\nThe director of a new documentary on First Lady Melania Trump, which they produced together, appeared in the newly released files in a photo embracing a young woman.\\nBrett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured.\\nResponse: There is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner\\'s representative for comment. He told Fox News he never had a personal relationship with Epstein, whom he says he met once. He said the woman he was pictured embracing was his fiancée at the time.\\nThe anti-aging influencer and CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, exchanged a number of emails with Epstein, including crass comments, the latest documents release shows.\\nIn the emails, he wrote that his friendship with Epstein was something he could share publicly and included a discussion of the 2018 Miami Herald story that identified some of Epstein\\'s victims.\\nHe also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex, emails show.\\nResponse: On 2 February, Attia made a statement on X rejecting that he was \"involved in any criminal activity\", adding that \" I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties\".\\nThe chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games sent flirty emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of Epstein.\\nCasey Wasserman\\'s messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, show him saying: \"I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"\\nMaxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein.\\nResponse: Wasserman said in a statement: \"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light.\"\\nSergey Brin, co-founder of Google and one of the world\\'s richest men, visited Epstein\\'s private island and made plans to dine at Epstein\\'s home in New York City, according to the documents released on Friday.\\nHe also corresponded with Ghislaine Maxwell, who wrote to Brin in April 2003: \"Dinners at Jeffrey\\'s are always happily casual and relaxed\", and, \"Look forward to seeing you\".\\nResponse: The BBC has reached out to Google for comment. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing in the emails.\\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is mentioned in the newly released Epstein-related documents, showing they corresponded on multiple occasions after Epstein was convicted for sex crimes in Florida in 2008.\\nOne exchange shows plans for Barak to stay at Epstein\\'s New York City residence in 2017.\\nResponse: Barak has acknowledged his regular interactions with Epstein but said he never observed or participated in any inappropriate behaviour or parties.\\nNoam Chomsky, the famed linguist, appeared in both releases of the Epstein files, and the latest tranche of documents suggests Chomsky advised Epstein on media coverage of sex trafficking allegations against him.\\nIn emails from February 2019, the disgraced financier asked Chomsky if he should \"defend myself\" or \"try to ignore\".\\nA response that appears to be from Chomsky laments \"the horrible way\" Epstein was treated and the \"hysteria that has developed about abuse of women\".\\n\"It\\'s painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,\" the email said.\\nResponse: In a statement, Chomsky\\'s wife and spokesperson, Valéria Chomsky, said that \"Epstein created a manipulative narrative about his case, which Noam, in good faith, believed in.\"\\n\"It is now clear that it was all orchestrated, having as, at least, one of Epstein\\'s intentions to try to have someone like Noam repairing Epstein\\'s reputation by association,\" she said.\\n\"Noam\\'s criticism was never directed at the women\\'s movement; on the contrary, he has always supported gender equity and women\\'s rights.\"\\nBrad Karp, the chairman of prestigious law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down from his role after the latest files showed dozens of apparent email exchanges between him and Epstein. One correspondence reportedly is said to show Karp discussing Epstein\\'s pre-existing plea deal on sex trafficking charges.\\nIn an email sent in March 2019, four months before Epstein\\'s arrest, a sender named Brad Karp said: \"The draft motion is in great shape.\"\\nBloomberg reported that this discussion related to Epstein\\'s efforts to protect the 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors, in which he avoided federal charges, which could have seen him face life in prison. There is nothing in the emails to prove that they were in fact linked to the plea deal.\\nResponse: Announcing his resignation in a company statement on Wednesday, Karp said: \"Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.\" The statement did not mention the Epstein files, and Karp has not commented since. The BBC has contacted Paul Weiss for further comment.\\nIn the justice department\\'s first release of Epstein documents in December, several images showed former US President Bill Clinton, including a picture of him swimming in a pool, and another with him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.\\nClinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was first arrested.\\nResponse: A spokesman for Clinton, Angel Ureña, said on social media in December that photos released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) were decades old. \"They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn\\'t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be,\" he said.\\n\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We\\'re in the first,\" he said.\\nIn a post on social media, Clinton said that he had told Congress everything he knows.\\n\"I have called for the full release of the Epstein files. I have provided a sworn statement of what I know,\" he said. \"And just this week, I\\'ve agreed to appear in person before the committee.\"\\nClinton will testify before the House Oversight Committee later this month, and has called for the hearing to be public.\\nThe files appear to reveal communication between Epstein and the self-help author Deepak Chopra years after Epstein\\'s 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from minors.\\nIn a February 2017 email, Chopra seemingly asks Epstein to come to Israel with him and an unnamed group.\\n\"Come to Israel with us,\" Chopra says. \"Relax and have fun with interesting people. [if] you want use a fake name . Bring your girls. It will be fun to have you .

       "  'Article': 'When Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at about 08:00 on Thursday, it had nothing to do with Virginia Giuffre, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse.\\nWhat led to him being arrested started with information that came out in the massive Epstein file release in January, around activities while he was a trade envoy for the British government. But it will not have stopped there.\\nIt was emails in those files that seem to be between Andrew and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that led to Thames Valley Police getting involved.\\nOne email in particular stood out. In November 2010, after Andrew had returned from a UK government-funded trip to Asia, he was sent a series of country reports relating to his trip.\\nWithin five minutes of receiving them he seems to have forwarded them to Epstein, who had by this point already been convicted and spent time in prison for sex offences.\\nThere were further email revelations from the files.\\nA month later, on Christmas Eve, Andrew appeared to email Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money.\\nIn a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew seems to suggest Epstein invest in a private equity firm he had visited a week before.\\nThese will have formed the beginning of what today turned into a full investigation by Thames Valley Police. But detectives will have not relied only on the emails that we have seen.\\nIn order to build a case they will have gone to the government and to the palace asking for emails that might explain what was going on. The palace said last Monday that it would \"support\" Thames Valley Police.\\nDetectives will also have done their own trawl of the three million documents in the Epstein files, and they will have asked for unredacted copies from the FBI or the US Department of Justice. The National Crime Agency is helping UK police forces with those requests.\\nSo far we have seen only the tip of the iceberg, but detectives may have seen more of what lies under the surface\\nIt is highly unlikely that the police arrested Andrew on Thursday on the basis of just a couple of emails people have seen within the Epstein files.\\nAt this stage, Andrew has only been arrested. He has not been charged. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising from his relationship with Epstein and has not responded to specific BBC questions about the files released in January.\\nAnd a reminder, this arrest has nothing to do with allegations Andrew has previously faced from Giuffre, who said she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions in the early 2000s. An out-of-court financial settlement was reached between Andrew and Giuffre in 2022, which made no admission of wrongdoing on Andrew\\'s part.\\nThe police released Andrew under investigation on Thursday evening. Typically with arrests relating to white collar crime, people are held for a few hours to allow for searches and initial questioning. Being released under investigation does not rule out further questioning at a later date.\\nNow detectives will have a big decision to make. This could take weeks.\\nPolice officers with a crown on their cap badges will sit down with lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service and decide if there is sufficient evidence to charge the King\\'s brother.\\nIf they decide to take the case to court, it will be called R v Mountbatten-Windsor, or in layman\\'s terms, the King against the King\\'s brother.\\n'},\n",

It was acquired by Universal Music in 2012.\\n\"Troubled industry but related to P,\" Stern wrote to Epstein.\\n\"P\", which Epstein apparently used to refer to women, is believed to be an abbreviation of the word \"pussy\", another term Epstein often used.\\nFor birthdays and New Year greetings, Stern wished Epstein \"lots of P\", according to the recently released files. He once offered to get Epstein fashion show tickets \"to review Chinese P\".\\nHe would send Epstein a \"P factor\" for the places he visited, giving the Spanish island Ibiza 9/10, and Sarah Ferguson\\'s 50th birthday party 0.2/10.\\nAt the time Epstein had considered asking Stern for his help in an EMI investment, Lord Mandelson was First Secretary of State and Business Secretary in the UK government.\\nStern said it was \"too early to get Mandelson involved before i know more\".\\nEpstein appears to have emailed Lord Mandelson a few days later, saying: \"please email me bens contact info.. or havehim cal me re emi.

At the time ministers said the operation was justified under international law.\\nQuestions of international law would likely be applied by the UK government in justifying support for any US military action in Iran.\\nUnder a long-held agreement, the US would have to first request to use any UK sovereign military bases before conducting military operations.\\nUnder international law, there is no distinction between a state carrying out the attack and those which have supported that state, if the latter has \"knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act\".\\nIn January, the BBC\\'s political editor Chris Mason asked Sir Keir whether he supported a potential US strike on Iran.\\nAt the time, the prime minister replied he was talking to allies about how to prevent Iran from developing nuclear activities and killing protesters.\\n\"The aim here is that Iran shouldn\\'t be able to develop nuclear weapons. That\\'s hugely important,\" he said.\\n\"And of course we need to deal with the fact that they are repressing protesters, killing protesters. It\\'s grotesque what is happening. And so that\\'s where our focus is and we\\'re working with allies to that end.\"\\nReacting to the latest developments, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, a long-standing Trump critic, said: \"It\\'s now clear Donald Trump is trying to bully the government into letting the US use UK bases like Diego Garcia to pursue unilateral military action.\\n\"Keir Starmer needs to stand strong and give Parliament a vote on the use of UK bases by US forces.\"\\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

Andrew is slumped in the back seat of a car after his release, fingers steepled, whether in prayer or protection.\\nHis collar is up. For that matter, his collar has been felt. Was Andrew\\'s expression of shock how he looked when he had a mugshot photo taken in police custody?\\nIt\\'ll become the counterpart of that other famous Andrew picture, taken almost 25 years ago, of a smiling confident prince, beside a 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre in a London townhouse, when the capital was his playground.\\nEarlier, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had become the first senior member of the Royal Family in modern history to have been arrested. It was another catch your breath moment.\\nIt was followed by an unprecedented statement from his brother, King Charles. \"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,\" read the unambiguous statement from the King, offering no hiding place or royal get-out clause.\\nThe arrest, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, relates to Andrew\\'s time as the UK\\'s trade representative between 2001 and 2011. It follows a series of allegations, prompted by the release of the Epstein files, that Andrew shared official documents.\\nThat included sharing reports from trade visits and a confidential briefing on investment in Afghanistan with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and passing a Treasury briefing to a personal business contact.\\nBeing a member of the Royal Family will make no legal difference to how his case is assessed.\\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein.\\nThe no-nonsense police statement on Thursday morning was a bluntly worded news earthquake: \"The man remains in police custody at this time.\"\\nWhoever thought we\\'d read that sentence when the man in question is still in the line of succession to the throne, and in theory, if not in practice, remains a counsellor of state?\\nAndrew\\'s explanation of his behaviour won\\'t be in a TV interview. The public will not have forgotten the BBC\\'s Newsnight interview, which remains the last time Andrew spoke publicly about his relationship with Epstein.\\nThis time, it will have been in the presence of a lawyer and the investigating officers, rather than under the TV lights, and the consequences of any untruths will be much more serious.\\nThe action by the police on a winter\\'s morning in Norfolk was remarkable breaking news - and also appeared to have taken the King by surprise as much as anyone else.\\nBut the story of Andrew\\'s links to Epstein has been decades in the making - and so has Andrew\\'s downfall, first chipping away at his reputation before turning into an avalanche of disgrace.\\nThe association with Epstein meant Andrew lost his trade envoy role in 2011, and after that disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019 he was removed as a working royal.\\nHis retreat from public life became even more complete after his 2022 settlement with his accuser Virginia Giuffre.\\nAnd in October last year, as emails revealed that Andrew hadn\\'t ended his links with Epstein when he had claimed, he was stripped of his prince and duke titles, and eventually shuffled out of his Royal Lodge home at Windsor.\\nThey were tough sanctions, removing any vestige of royal status.\\nThe Palace has had some nervous moments in recent times, with questions shouted by hecklers suggesting they might be protecting Andrew.\\nThe statement from the King will have sought to draw a line under this and separate the Royal Family from whatever might happen to Andrew.\\nAnother important factor in all of this is the public mood. The Epstein files, and what they have revealed regarding a network of those apparently high in connections but low on morals, have left people feeling angry at such unaccountable power and wealth.\\nIt has felt abusive to the public, that the rich and influential appear to have been immune from the consequences of their behaviour, be it in terms of either sex or money. It has seemed to the public that corruption paid.\\nMaking the arrest even more resonant is that it happened on Andrew\\'s 66th birthday. Any candles would have to wait.\\nThere are references to Andrew\\'s previous birthdays in the Epstein files, such as a glitzy bash for his 50th at St James\\'s Palace.\\nOne person who had to turn down the invite for that night of \"mysterious mischief\" was Jeffrey Epstein, who was still under house arrest as part of a sentence for procuring a minor for prostitution.\\nAndrew celebrated his birthday 12 months ago as Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Knight of the Garter. Who knows what will have changed by his next birthday.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'When Jane Kingsbury, 80, last had her eyes tested, she says her optician told her that her eyesight was OK. But Jane, from Cambridge, says she is giving up driving at night because the feeling of being \"dazzled\" by other vehicles has left her feeling unsafe. \"I am worried about the glare from oncoming lights,\" she says.\\nAnd when Jane mentioned this at a discussion group she attends, others felt the same. \"Over 90% of us did not want to drive in the dark,\" says Jane. \"So we have changed the time of our meetings from 7.30pm to 1.30pm [for much of the year] so that we can drive home before dark.\"\\nJane and her friends aren\\'t alone. In a debate at Westminster last October, MPs voiced widespread concerns about bright headlights. Some described social isolation among constituents who had become too scared to drive in the dark.\\nThe RAC motoring organisation, which has campaigned on headlight dazzle, has repeatedly asked its members for their views. Most recently, more than half of respondents to a survey of 1,745 UK drivers in January this year felt the problem had worsened in the past 12 months. A third of those who said they were affected by dazzle said they felt less safe when driving at night.\\nIt\\'s not only older drivers who feel this way. Emily McGuire from Essex told the BBC: \"I am in my 30s and sometimes I can\\'t tell if [other vehicles\\'] main beam is on or off and once they have passed, I can\\'t see properly for a good few minutes, it\\'s terrible.\"\\nShe owns a smaller car and feels that she can\\'t avoid the lights on higher, bigger cars: \"I suffer with migraines when a car approaches me with extremely bright lights, I have to look down or in the other direction… I also have to slow right down when it\\'s really dark and I\\'m on a country lane.\"\\nAnd experts say the problem is getting worse. Denise Voon, clinical advisor at the College of Optometrists - which also campaigns on the issue - says: \"I am a practising optometrist and I\\'ve noticed that maybe 15 years ago, you rarely had people coming in complaining about headlight glare. But now it\\'s becoming more and more prevalent.\"\\nIt\\'s an issue that has even reached the United Nations - it will mandate all new cars to automatically adjust their headlight levels.\\nBut this will only affect new cars. And so the questions many are asking are: what, if anything, can be done about all the cars currently out there causing headlight discomfort - and why did nobody spot that this might be a problem?\\nExperts believe a number of factors can cause headlight dazzle.\\nOne is the angle of headlights. If misaligned, they are more likely to cause glare. Misalignment can cause a vehicle to fail its MoT test.\\nThen there\\'s the fact that headlights have got brighter, to help drivers see better.\\nHeadlights have moved a long way from the \"kind of brown glow\" produced by filament bulbs decades ago, according to Dale Harrow, professor of Intelligent Mobility and Car Design at the Royal College of Art in London. They have become more complex and \"a design object in their own right,\" he says.\\nGlass casings have given way to plastic and significantly, the light source has changed too, with most people now using LEDs instead of halogen bulbs, he says - the quality has improved and lights are now \"brighter, but also a lot clearer\".\\nWhile this \"has to be a good thing\" when it comes to helping the driver see clearly, Harrow says, it has also resulted in \"unplanned drawbacks\" - including dazzling other road users.\\nAnother problem is the illegal retrofitting of LED bulbs, especially when fitted into units designed for halogen. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency has said it has stepped up a crackdown on retrofit bulbs, with sellers facing potential fines of up to £1,000.\\n\"Recent advances in headlight technology have improved visibility but all headlights – whether LED or not – must still be aimed correctly and checked at the MOT test,\" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\\nOur eyes adapt in the dark to become a lot more sensitive to light, says Denise Voon. As a result, being suddenly hit by very bright lights can temporarily make it very hard to see, even causing pain.\\nRetinal cells at the back of the eyes which detect the light can get bleached, and take a while to recover. That\\'s when people notice an imprint remaining in their vision after looking away.\\nAlthough headlight glare does affect younger people, age is thought to be a factor. Older people are more prone to conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma, for example.\\nVoon says there are a number of reasons why LEDs may be particularly problematic. Firstly, they are two to three times as bright as traditional halogens, and their \"colour temperature\" is bluer and whiter, which mimics natural daylight.\\nAlso, LED lights \"are a lot more directional, so you\\'ve got this much brighter, whiter light in a very directional point hitting your eye compared to the more diffuse halogen ones\".\\nIt\\'s not clear if it is the brightness, colour, temperature or the direction of the lights - or some combination of all of these - that causes most problems, she says: \"But what we know is that\\'s one of the differences.\"\\nDespite widespread concerns that the problem is getting worse, there isn\\'t evidence that brighter lights are causing more accidents.\\nStatistics from the Department for Transport (DfT) show that headlight dazzle was recorded as a contributory factor in 216 collisions in 2023. Four of those collisions were fatal.\\nAlthough the overall number of collisions rose very slightly compared to the previous year, it was far below the 330 recorded in 2014. The figure was also lower than any of the intervening years except 2020, when the pandemic meant fewer drivers on the roads.\\nBut the fact that since 2024 \"vision affected by dazzling headlights\" is no longer listed in the DfT\\'s published statistics as a contributory factor in its own right, makes comparisons or identification of a trend harder.\\nEqually, these statistics don\\'t tell us whether some people are choosing not to drive at night and nor do they account for other changes in driver behaviour.\\nStill, a government-commissioned report by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), published last year, found that drivers \"perceived glare from vehicle headlamps to be an important and widespread issue when driving at night\".\\nIt also concluded that headlamps were perceived as \"too bright\", and that \"whiter\" headlamps and those on larger vehicles were \"generally perceived to be especially problematic for causing glare\".\\nSo far so obvious, you may think, based on what campaigners have been saying for some time. But the study went further.\\nResearchers took out a car at night, rigged with equipment to measure light intensity and an observer in the vehicle could press a button if they felt glare might interfere with their driving.\\nThe study drew a link between higher levels of luminance - meaning the intensity of light - and the likelihood of experiencing glare. It also suggested that 40,000 candela per sq m - a measure of luminance - may be an \"important threshold for the experience of glare being more likely\".\\nAlso, when the research car was travelling uphill or around a right-hand bend, glare was more likely, researchers said - a driver\\'s eyes are more likely to fall within the \"throw\" of headlamps from oncoming vehicles.\\nEchoing the concerns of experts, researchers also found \"some tentative indication that larger body shapes such as SUVs and models with light-emitting diode (LED) headlamps may be more likely to be associated with glare\". However, further research was recommended in this area.\\nThe government has since agreed to conduct such further research. But this has not started yet, and it\\'s unlikely to begin for at least a couple of months.\\nBut all this raises the question of why nobody anticipated widespread complaints about glare - in spite of all the research and development work that\\'s been carried out by carmakers around the world. \"It seems more priority has been put on giving drivers the best possible view of the road at night and less on the consequences for oncoming traffic,\" says Simon Williams, the RAC\\'s head of policy.\\nManufacturers reject this. \"Safety is every car maker\\'s top priority and providing good visibility to drivers in darkened conditions is essential,\" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. \"All headlights must meet international standards so drivers can see as clearly as possible but without dazzling other drivers.\"\\nIn October, I had the opportunity to speak to Thomas Broberg, senior advisor for safety at Volvo\\'s Car Safety Centre in Gothenburg, Sweden. He explained how vehicles have to meet the standards of countries in which the manufacturer wants to sell them - vehicle manufacturing being an international business.\\nThere are regulations around the headlights themselves, he says, covering their shape, intensity and glare. Also, headlights are tested on the road by different authorities and \"as a global car company, we need to comply with all of them\".\\nBroberg said it was a \"concern\" that people are complaining about glare, but insisted that avoiding glare was part of the design process. He also pushed back against the suggestion that SUVs end up dazzling people more. \"The angle of the light is actually regulated,\" he says. \"So if you have a higher vehicle, then you need to have a lower [beam] angle.\"\\nHe argues that road geometry, and poor aiming of headlights in cars that don\\'t have automatic levelling systems, are more likely culprits.\\nIn theory, technological innovations should help, particularly auto-dimming - although not everyone finds that they dip early enough.\\nOff the back of the TRL report, the government has promised to look further into design factors that may be contributing to glare. The idea would be to use the findings to propose changes to international regulations at the United Nations.\\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has a World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. Following an agreement by this forum, new vehicles are meant to have mandatory automatic headlight levelling by September 2027. The effect of this technology is to correct the aim of headlights if the vehicle\\'s load changes.\\nBut this would not change the headlight settings on the millions of cars on our roads already.\\nThe TRL report also points out that \"many instances of glare are likely to remain even with stronger regulation\", because real-world situations of \"road geometry\" - the shape of the road, with ups, downs and corners - are not realistically under DfT\\'s control.\\n\"We know headlamp glare is a real frustration for many drivers and is even discouraging some from driving at night,\" a DfT spokesperson says. \"That\\'s why we\\'re investigating the causes as part of our Road Safety Strategy and are pressing for improvements to international lighting regulations.\"\\nThere are some basic things drivers can do to reduce the impact bright lights have on them. For example, keep their windscreen clean, inside and out.\\nThe College of Optometrists reminds motorists to always wear glasses if they have them, and make sure they are clean. It also advises staying up to date with vision tests, which can also pick up problems with eye health.\\nMore practical advice when confronted with bright oncoming headlights is to briefly look to the side of the road, keeping your eyes open - and of course, be considerate of other drivers when you\\'re behind the wheel yourself.\\nFor Emily and others affected by glare, this guidance will have to make do for the time being.

       "  'Article': 'Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\\nIt comes after Thames Valley Police said it was assessing a complaint over the alleged sharing of confidential material by the former prince with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\\nThe former prince has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\\nHe has since been released under investigation. Andrew was seen leaving Aylsham police station on Thursday evening.\\nMountbatten-Windsor was arrested at about 08:00 GMT on Thursday on the King\\'s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, where he has been staying.\\nOfficers arrested the King\\'s brother on his 66th birthday.\\nIt is understood that neither the King nor Buckingham Palace was informed in advance of Mountbatten-Windsor\\'s arrest, by officers from Thames Valley Police.\\nWe don\\'t know the specifics of the allegations of misconduct in public office being investigated.\\nHowever, previously reported allegations include that he had shared reports from trade visits, forwarded a confidential briefing on investment in Afghanistan, and passed a Treasury briefing to a personal business contact.\\nBBC News UK and home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said: \"There has to be an assumption that part of this is going to be the sharing of documents within the Epstein files - between Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein himself. That\\'s when Thames Valley Police got involved.\"\\nBut Sandford said it was possible that police were not only focusing on emails seen widely in the Epstein files.\\n\"Firstly, there\\'s three million documents in the files, so there may be some the media have missed. But secondly, Buckingham Palace said they would support Thames Valley Police in their inquiries.\\n\"And that potentially means the police have gone to the Palace, or could go to the Palace, asking to see evidence of communications between Andrew and others.\"\\nAssistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright of Thames Valley Police said: \"We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.\"\\nThe force said it would not be naming the arrested man \"as per national guidance\".\\nIn a later update on Thursday evening, Thames Valley Police confirmed the arrested man \"has now been released under investigation\".\\nIt is the first time the former prince, who has faced numerous allegations over his links to Epstein, has been arrested.\\nMisconduct in public office is a really complicated offence, writes BBC News home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani.\\nIt essentially boils down to an allegation that someone who was doing a job on behalf of the British public did something seriously wrong, knowing it to be wrong.\\nThere are four \"elements\" or factors that police must focus on during their investigation so that prosecutors can later decide whether or not someone should be charged.\\nFirst, the police must establish whether the person they\\'re investigating was a \"public officer\" and the incident in question was plausibly part of those duties.\\nIf that\\'s agreed, detectives will then look for evidence that the incident in question saw the suspect \"wilfully\" neglecting to perform their duty or wilfully misconducting themselves in some other way. That wordy definition has long been a source of legal debate.\\nThe next question is whether the action they committed was so bad that it was \"an abuse of the public\\'s trust\".\\nLastly, if the evidence has passed those three tests, police need to examine whether the person under investigation acted \"without reasonable excuse or justification\".\\nThat final question is crucial. It\\'s a fundamental principle of criminal justice that someone suspected of wrongdoing is given an opportunity to put forward their side of the story - and that starts when the police come and knock on their door.\\nKing Charles\\'s brother spent much of his 66th birthday in custody and we\\'ve just received word on where he had been taken.\\nThe former prince was pictured slumped back in a vehicle following his release from Aylsham police station on Thursday evening.\\nTypically with arrests relating to white collar crime, people are held for a few hours to allow for searches and initial questioning. Being released under investigation does not rule out further questioning at a later date.\\nAt some point a decision will have to be made by the Crown Prosecution Service and Thames Valley Police about whether to charge the King\\'s brother with misconduct in a public office.\\nIt could be weeks before any substantial decision is made.\\nOn Thursday morning, Thames Valley Police said that, in addition to the arrest, it was \"carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk\".\\nUnmarked police vehicles were seen arriving at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk before Mountbatten-Windsor\\'s arrest.\\nIn an updated statement following Andrew\\'s release, Thames Valley Police said its searches in Norfolk \"have now concluded\".\\nIn recent weeks, Andrew has set up a temporary home on the estate whilst his permanent residence there, Marsh Farm, is being renovated.\\nMeanwhile, BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson, said she had seen uniformed police officers close to the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park.\\nUntil very recently, this sprawling property in Berkshire is where Andrew lived.\\nBBC News understands that searches are being carried out at Royal Lodge and that the officers are there to guard the scene. It is thought to be the only address being searched at the moment in Berkshire.\\nDal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent, told BBC News that by arresting the King\\'s brother, officers will be able to \"to access computer equipment, files, photographs, any other evidence\".\\nHe said they will be able to \"carry out searches of any premises he owns or occupies, or any other premises he controls, so there may well be searches in other areas as well\".\\nThe King has said \"the law must take its course\", following the arrest of his brother.\\nIn a statement the King said: \"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office.\\n\"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.\\n\"In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation.\\n\"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.\\n\"As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter.\\n\"Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.

That would help drive prices right down.\"\\nSustainable Economic Development Minister Kirsten Morel, who led the negotiations for the ferry deal, said it was unfortunate if choosing separate operators led to higher prices on food but added he would not apologise for \"protecting Jersey\\'s food supply chain\".\\nSandpiper CI, which manages the M&S franchise in Jersey, in December 2025 wrote to the island\\'s scrutiny panel requesting a review of the contract signed between DFDS and the Government of Jersey.\\nMark Cox, chief executive of the Channel Islands Coop, previously said dealing with the two different ferry contracts was \"challenging\" and added to the \"complexity of a very expensive supply chain\".\\nWaitrose said its prices were \"fairly based on additional costs\" while Morrisons said prices differed in the islands from the UK \"due to the additional costs such as logistics\".\\nCI Coop, a separate business to the Co-op Group in the UK, said: \"Our location means higher shipping and freight costs, and getting goods on to island shelves is simply more expensive.\\n\"Over the past three years, inflation in the islands has been higher than in the UK, and local wage levels already exceed the UK National Living Wage.\\n\"These factors all contribute to the cost of operating here and, inevitably, influence the prices customers see.\\n\"We also apply the same pricing across Jersey and Guernsey, with differences only where required by local taxes.\\n\"This means any variation is limited to GST and products subject to different duty rates, such as tobacco, beers, wines, and spirits.\"\\nIn 2024, Morrisons began running supermarket franchises in the islands and began expanding later that year.\\nIt said: \"Since acquiring our stores in the Channel Islands we have been working hard on reviewing our customer offerings.\\n\"Since November, we have reduced over 890 prices and currently offer the cheapest prices for a wide range of basket staples such as bread, milk, tea, eggs and butter.\"\\nThe BBC contacted Sandpaper CI but the company declined to comment.\\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

       "  'Article': 'Donald Trump has thrown the UK\\'s Chagos deal into doubt as he launched a stinging criticism of the plan that would see the UK hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a joint UK-US military base.\\nThe US president urged Sir Keir Starmer not to \"give away Diego Garcia\" - the largest island on the archipelago and home to the base.\\nTrump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media.\\nThis comes despite Washington on Tuesday giving its official backing to London\\'s plan to cede sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius.\\nIn response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was \"crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe\".\\n\"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,\" it said in a statement.\\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.\\nDiego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.\\nUnder the deal - which was announced last May - the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years at an average cost of £101m a year.\\nTrump\\'s latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.\\nThe US president\\'s position on the issue has seen rapid U-turns in recent months - from describing the planned transfer as an \"act of great stupidity\" to saying the deal was the \"best\" the prime minister could make.\\nUK ministers have previously said that the deal could not go ahead unless it had the support of the US.\\nThe bill, aimed at enshrining the agreement into UK law, has been delayed and there is no date set for the next stage.\\nUK Minister Alex Davies-Jones said the bill would return to the House of Lords \"as soon as parliamentary time allows\".\\nPosting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"\\nThe US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\\n\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said.\\n\"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"\\nAnd referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran\\'s controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the airfield located in Fairford in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"\\nThe Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities.\\nThe US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.\\nAsked by the BBC about Trump\\'s latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it\\'s coming straight from the horse\\'s mouth.\\n\"When you see it on Truth Social you know it\\'s directly from President Trump, that\\'s the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration\\'s policies.\"\\nBut on Tuesday, the US Department of State gave its official backing to the planned handover of the Chagos Islands.\\nIn a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".\\nShadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: \"It\\'s time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether.\"\\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Trump\\'s endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer\\'s approach is doomed to fail.\"\\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history.\"\\nEarlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands\\' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.\\nThey refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.\\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme, Misley Mandarin - one of the Chagossians who had travelled to the islands - said they would have to \"drag me from my beach\".\\nHe said \"there\\'s no reason\" for the deal \"because Mauritius never owned Chagos Islands in the first place\".\\n\"Keir Starmer, you could be a hero right now - don\\'t ratify that deal, cancel that deal and let Chagossians come back to their homeland as British,\" he added.\\nThe Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.\\nThe islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.\\nBut Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.\\nIn the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.\\nSome of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.\\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.\\n'},\n",

This action isn\\'t about the money but ensuring those who had to give up their military lives and careers get the justice they\\'re entitled to.\"\\nThe threat of legal action is likely to cause embarrassment for the MoD, which has been keen to publicise the work its done to make reparations for the suffering caused by the ban, including hosting an official event in which the King dedicated a memorial to LGBT+ service personnel.\\nAngela Jackman KC, a partner at Irwin Mitchell, representing the veterans, said: \"The scheme makes no allowance for Dismissed or Discharged Payment to potentially thousands of enlisted personnel who say they were subjected to discrimination and harassment, including disciplinary proceedings, which forced them to resign.\\n\"In some cases, veterans say they were given an ultimatum to resign otherwise face consequences such as dishonourable discharge.\\n\"The rules simply do not acknowledge numerous circumstances where veterans were constructively dismissed.\"\\nStewart served for seven years in the British Army as a corporal in the Royal Military Police, where he was deployed in the Gulf War and in Northern Ireland, receiving a Accumulated Campaign Service Medal for his long-term service.\\nHe left the army in 1995 following an investigation into his sexuality, which he says was \"intrusive and deeply traumatic\".\\nHe added: \"The least I and many others deserve is for the redress scheme to actually recognise what happened to hundreds, if not thousands of service personnel, was wrong.\"\\nThe MoD has previously vowed to speed up the awards process after it was criticised for handling applications too slowly, particularly for elderly and infirm veterans.\\nBBC News understands that a number of former service personnel who were eligible for the scheme have died while waiting for payouts.\\nEd Hall, chairman of LGBT+ veterans support charity Fighting with Pride, said: \"This scheme is an opportunity for the government to put itself on the right side of history, and we urge the government to listen and address the manifest injustice these former service people are facing.\"\\nA spokesperson for the MoD previously said it \"deeply regrets the treatment of LGBT serving personnel between 1967 and 2000, which was wholly unacceptable\" and that what they experienced was \"not reflective of today\\'s values or the inclusive culture of our armed forces\".\\nThe BBC has contacted the MoD for its response to the threat of legal action.\\n'},\n",

I think we need to make sure that we do it right if we\\'re going to look for a legislative way\".\\nShe added: \"We\\'re ready to get involved in any consultation process that there is locally with regards to either extending the Online Safety Act to Guernsey or creating our own legislation\".\\nIt is also something that has divided opinion between young people in Jersey.\\nVictoria College students Robbie, 16, and Felix, 15, have been studying online safety in their PHSE lessons.\\nRobbie said: \"I feel like we should have the ban for under-16s... the reels and the short clips I feel like are not good for young minds\".\\nFelix disagreed and said: \"I\\'m personally against the idea of a ban... I just think that that kind of behaviour could just shift to a different medium if we try and limit technology\".\\nThe lessons are led by PHSE teacher Gillian Silver who said online safety is societal problem that has to be addressed.\\n\"I think the biggest thing they feed back to us is they would like their parents to be more involved in their online worlds,\" she said.\\n\"We also have joined up thinking across our schools about what are the issues that young people are asking for support around.\"\\nShe added: \"I think it\\'s really important that we hear what they\\'re saying\" and lessons should be \"organic, reactive, and proactive to what\\'s going on\".\\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

that while the police are \"assessing\" the information, it would not necessarily lead to a full investigation.\\nLast year a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to the convicted sex offender had arrived at or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018.\\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the New Statesman last week that police \"urgently\" need to re-examine whether Jeffrey Epstein\\'s victims were trafficked within and outside of the UK.\\nAn Essex Police spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\"\\nIn December, BBC News discovered that three British women who were allegedly trafficked appear in Epstein\\'s records of flights in and out of the UK alongside other documents related to the convicted sex offender.\\nUS lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims told the BBC it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a \"full-scale\" investigation into his activities in the UK.\\nBrown said the scale of trafficking would \"become apparent\" if an investigation had been conducted into the flights.\\nThe former PM wrote to the chief police constables and commissioner of the Met, Essex and Thames Valley Police.\\nHe added that Stansted, located around 40 miles away from central London, was one of the airports \"where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\".\\nStansted Airport said in a statement: \"All private aircraft at London Stansted operate through independent Fixed Base Operators, which handle all aspects of private and corporate aviation in line with regulatory requirements.\"\\nThe airport said that these terminals are \"entirely independent\" and that \"no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal\".\\nImmigration and customs checks for passengers arriving via private jets are carried out \"directly by Border Force\", it said, adding that it does not \"manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft\".\\nBBC News has again contacted police forces in areas where Epstein-linked flights landed or took off from, including Police Scotland, Merseyside, Belfast, West Midlands, and Bedfordshire.\\nOur investigations team is sifting through the latest Epstein documents released by the US Department of Justice to see what other flights and trains Epstein may have used to travel in the UK.\\nThe Essex Police statement comes as a new national group has been set up to support UK forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files, the National Police Chiefs\\' Council (NPCC) has said.\\nThames Valley Police is assessing allegations, reported by the BBC, that a second woman was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\\nThe force previously said it has held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein during his time as the UK\\'s trade envoy.\\nElsewhere, Norfolk Constabulary said it was \"reviewing documents\" released in the US to \"ensure that all relevant information has been properly assessed\".\\nA spokesperson said the force had \"not received any allegations and is not currently conducting any investigation\", but that it was \"reviewing documents\" released in the US to \"ensure that all relevant information has been properly assessed\".\\nLast year, a BBC News investigation found one arrival and departure of an Epstein-linked flight at RAF Marham in west Norfolk.\\nSeparately, the tranche of documents released in December included a photograph taken the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk of Andrew lying across the laps of women, with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell standing in the background.\\nThe former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.\\nEarlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.\\nTwo properties linked to the former business secretary and British ambassador to the US were searched following the allegations.\\nThe BBC understands Lord Mandelson\\'s position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.\\nLord Mandelson has previously expressed regret for his continued association with Epstein and apologised \"to the women and the girls who suffered\".\\nHe was dismissed from his role as ambassador in September, after Downing Street said new information had emerged about the depth of this relationship with Epstein.\\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

A British passport costs around £100 for an adult, while the certificate of entitlement costs £589.\\nThese new rules for dual nationals are linked to the roll out of the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) system this month, a major immigration reform which will require visitors to the UK who do not have a visa to apply for a £16 entry document before arriving.\\nThe government said it plans to increase the ETA fee to £20 in the future.\\nDual nationals cannot apply for an ETA and must meet the new documentation requirements instead, with checks now carried out by airlines when departing en route back to the UK.\\nThe new rules do not apply to Irish passport holders but other EU citizens will be affected.\\nAccording to the latest census in 2021, 1.2% of UK-born residents were UK-other dual citizens (587,600) and 6.5% of non-UK-born residents were UK-other dual citizens (648,700).\\nThe government has said the reforms bring the UK\\'s immigration system into line with countries like the US and Australia.\\nBut critics say the looming deadline and a lack of communication around the changes have left people scrambling to apply for new documents, with dual nationals who are out of the country on holiday or visiting family facing the prospect of being stranded until they can acquire a passport or the certificate.\\nJelena, who was born in Latvia and has lived in the UK ever since coming to study, became a British citizen in November.\\nThe 34-year-old chartered surveyor told BBC News she delayed applying for a British passport when she became a citizen as she was travelling to see family for Christmas, so could not send off her Latvian passport as part of the application process.\\nJelena only learned of the changes recently and is unable to apply for new documentation immediately as she is due to go on a long-planned trip to South America in a few weeks and may not get her passport back in time to travel.\\n\"As it stands, after South America, I won\\'t be able to return to my flat [in Glasgow], which me and my husband own, in the country I have lived in for nearly 16 years, studied in and paid taxes,\" she told BBC Your Voice.\\nJelena intends to change her travel plans by returning to Latvia after her trip to apply for a British passport from there, potentially facing a wait of several weeks or months for it to arrive.\\n\"I\\'m lucky that my employer is flexible about me working from abroad - if that wasn\\'t the case, I wouldn\\'t have a job because of this,\" she said.\\n\"If I hadn\\'t applied for citizenship and just had an EU passport, I would be in a better situation than I am now,\" she added.\\n\"The irony is that I\\'ve chosen to be part of this country but it feels like I\\'m being deported. It feels like a betrayal.\"\\nPetra Gartzen, a UK-German dual national who has lived in the UK for four decades, said she was furious at the lack of communication about the upcoming changes and is frantically trying to secure a passport from Spain, where she is staying for a few months over the winter.\\nShe told BBC News: \"They changed the rules when I was already in Spain. There was no lead up, no major announcement - I found out about it from a Facebook post, and just thought, now what?\"\\nThe government says publicly available information has been in circulation about the upcoming changes since October 2024 but critics say it has not cut through to people affected.\\nPetra, a tech industry analyst, was told she would need to travel from southern Spain to Madrid for an appointment in order to apply for the \"ridiculously expensive\" certificate of entitlement while outside the UK, adding to the expense.\\nPetra has now applied for a UK passport from Spain - but that had its own complications. \"They agreed to accept a notarised copy of my German passport so I did not have to send that off, but they also wanted my original citizenship certificate - which I don\\'t have, it\\'s in the UK,\" she explained.\\nPetra now has a \"nervous wait\" to see if the documentation she was able to provide is accepted and processed in time for early March, when she is due to travel back to the UK before heading to the US for work.\\nShe said she felt let down by the way the changes have been introduced, adding: \"I\\'ve been a British citizen since 2019. The UK is my home - I\\'ve lived there for 40 years, I own a home, I work and pay tax. My whole life is there.\"\\nSwiss dual national Shaun West said he was considering not replacing his British passport and renouncing his citizenship over the new requirements.\\n\"There\\'s no worth in it for me,\" said the university professor, who became a Swiss citizen after Brexit.\\nHe said he would rather pay the ETA fee to temporarily enter the UK to see his parents, adding: \"[The government] said I\\'ll lose consular services. I\\'m not bothered. [They said] you won\\'t be able to live here. I\\'m not going to.\"\\nWest said that he found out about the rule change \"utterly by accident\" by reading online about how it affected Canadians, and said he believed it was discriminatory against dual nationals.\\nNorwegian dual national Linn Kathenes, who lives in the UK, said she was only notified by the Home Office about the new rules last week.\\nThe teacher said that the changes mean she is now in a race against time to make arrangements for an upcoming overseas school trip.\\nKathenes explained that she is waiting to collect her Norwegian passport, which she had to renew. She needs to send over the document before she can begin the process of getting the UK passport required to travel.\\n\"I don\\'t see another way, I just have to gamble\", she said.\\nThe Home Office has been contacted about her case.\\nCampaign group the3million, which represents EU citizens in the UK, has also criticised government communication around the changes.\\n\"The Home Office has not done enough to warn dual nationals of the serious impact this will have on them,\" the group\\'s head of policy and advocacy, Monique Hawkins, said.\\nShe has called on the government to \"urgently hit the pause button\" and introduce a \"low-cost, one-off travel authorisation\" for dual nationals who have found their travel plans disrupted.\\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Public information advising dual nationals to carry the correct documentation has been available since October 2024 and a substantive communications campaign about the introduction of ETA has been running since 2023.\\n\"This requirement applies to all British citizens regardless of other nationality and is the same approach taken by other countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia.\"\\nYou can also contact us by following this link\\n'},\n",

Allegations include phone tapping over a 20-year period.\\nANL has strongly denied the claims.\\nAt the High Court, barrister David Sherborne, representing Baroness Lawrence, questioned Wright about whether the Daily Mail\\'s reporting was partly motivated by a belief that the Lawrence family was benefiting financially from the case.\\n\"I have worked tirelessly for 25 years to help the Lawrence family get justice for their son,\" Wright, a veteran Daily Mail staffer, responded.\\n\"Mr Sherborne you should be ashamed of yourself ... given what Mr and Mrs Lawrence went through I wouldn\\'t begrudge them any money.\"\\nStephen, aged 18, was stabbed by a gang while waiting at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London.\\nThe Metropolitan Police\\'s failures to properly investigate the five prime suspects in the case became notorious and led to the force being branded \"institutionally racist\" by a landmark public inquiry in 1999.\\nThe Lawrences received £320,000 in compensation in 2000 for police failures.\\nTwo men were were found guilty of murdering Stephen after a trial in 2012, but the other suspects have not been convicted.\\nThe Daily Mail campaigned on the Lawrence family\\'s behalf, running a famous front page in 1997 naming the five prime suspects in Stephen\\'s murder.\\nBaroness Lawrence said in a previous case statement she believed the Mail was on her son\\'s side but now felt she had been \"played for a fool\", alleging private phone calls and conversations were secretly recorded by investigators.\\nOne of the investigators, Gavin Burrows, previously said in a witness statement he worked for the Daily Mail in phone tapping and \"blagging\" private information. He has since retracted this statement, claiming his signature was forged.\\nWright told the court the reason he mentioned the retracted claims in his own statement was because \"for four years I\\'ve lived under a cloud of the most despicable allegations it\\'s possible to put to any journalist.\"\\n\"Of course I had to respond to it. To deny it.\"\\nWright also strongly denied allegations he met private investigator Jonathan Rees and corrupt police officers in Thornton Heath pubs to pay them for information for stories.\\nWright said in his witness statement he spoke with John Ross, an ex-police officer sacked for misconduct, who was a \"very good tipster\" he took to lunch once or twice a year to maintain contact. He however denied paying serving police officers for information.\\nWright later called an allegation of paying a private investigator to \"blag\" information from Lady Lawrence \"absolute nonsense\".\\nFurther questions were raised about records showing Wright repeatedly commissioning private investigator firm ELI (Express Locate International) to obtain information.\\nThe former Daily Mail journalist said it was for legal searches of the electoral roll and land registry, which were difficult to obtain in-house.\\nHowever, Sherborne produced emails in court indicating the Mail newspapers had provided access to the electoral roll and phone directory for journalists\\' research.\\nHe said reporters turned to ELI because it specialised in unlawful methods for obtaining ex-directory phone numbers and other personal information.\\nThe case is set to continue throughout February.\\n'},\n",

Andrew has previously strongly denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein and rejected any suggestion he used his time as trade envoy to further his own interests.\\nEarlier in February, Thames Valley Police confirmed it was assessing whether there are grounds to investigate a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic, which reported Mountbatten-Windsor for suspected misconduct in public office and breach of official secrets.\\nKing Charles has previously said Buckingham Palace was ready to support the police as they considered allegations against his brother Andrew.\\nByrne said parliamentary recess meant the Business and Trade Committee had not yet had a chance to consider the allegations about Andrew, but added he was working to ensure \"the committee\\'s got options in front of them when they meet on Tuesday for how we might or might not take this investigation forward\".\\nHe said he couldn\\'t \"pre-judge\" the committee\\'s decision about whether an investigation was necessary, but added: \"At this stage, all I can say is nothing is off the table\".\\nIn theory select committees - cross-party groups of MPs covering specific policy areas - have the power to force witnesses to attend a session to answer questions.\\nHowever, this does not apply to members of the Royal Family and such an appearance would be unprecedented.\\nIn practice, there are few repercussions if someone does refuse to attend.\\nBryne, the MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North, is the latest person to suggest the former Duke of York could face an investigation for his conduct while serving as a UK trade envoy.\\nSir Vince Cable, who was secretary of state for business and trade for some of the former duke\\'s time as trade envoy, said police should \"check on whether criminal corruption took place\" adding a \"government investigation\" was needed to explore \"how this was allowed to happen.\"\\nByrne\\'s comments come as the National Police Chiefs\\' Council (NPCC) announced a new national group has been set up to support UK police forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files.\\nIt is understood the national coordination group will bring together affected forces to ensure consistency.\\nThe group is not an investigative team, and each force will remain responsible for any potential offences that occurred within their jurisdiction.\\n'},\n",

which is the maximum permitted without the need to hold a referendum.\\nThis breaks down to 2.99% for general council services and a specific 2% levy for adult social care.\\nIf approved on Wednesday, this would see its part of the bill rise by £83.81 to £1,763.46 for a Band D property.\\nThe leading Liberal Democrat group has said it will put more money in to road maintenance and Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND), but is also proposing to increase parking charges.\\nThe six districts are planning increases of between 2.99% and 3.35% – taking their sections of the bill to between £155 in Tewkesbury and £252 in Cheltenham.\\nPolice and Crime Commissioner Chris Nelson will be increasing the police\\'s part by 5.7% to £340.\\nTown and parish councils are also considering hikes.\\nDue to the number of councils and individual boundaries it is difficult to give an accurate overall estimate for council tax in the county, but if all budgets are approved, an average Band D property will pay approximately £2,320 next year.\\nCouncils across Gloucestershire and England as a whole say they are under huge financial strain.\\nMany claim they are being forced to take on more responsibilities and face higher service demands with less help from central government.\\nAt the start of the month a Local Government Association (LGA) report found six in 10 councils in England said they will find it difficult to set a balanced budget for the next financial year, and eight in 10 will likely apply for help from central government under a process called Exceptional Financial Support (EFS).\\nLouise Gittins, LGA Chair, said: \"Councils are doing everything they can to protect the services people rely on but demand and costs continue to rise faster than funding, leaving many with no choice but to consider emergency financial support.\"\\nWhen it comes to Gloucestershire County Council, 75% of its budget is spent on social services, statutory services which it has to provide by law.\\nLiberal Democrat council leader Lisa Spivey said this puts pressure on spending in other departments.\\n\"The reality is there is just not enough money to go around, so when residents expect us to fill more potholes in, resurface roads, but also deliver adult care, children\\'s social services, it\\'s really really difficult,\" she added.\\n\"What we really need is more money across the country.\"\\nCentral government has announced it will cover 90% the growing local authority debt around SEND services in England, which is estimated to reach up to £211m in Gloucestershire by 2028.\\nEven with this help, there are widespread concerns councils in England will only be able to provide statutory services in the near future, with others such as libraries and museums having to be cut back completely.\\n\"Without a real injection of more money in to the system as a whole, we will get to a point where we\\'ll have to make really difficult decisions about what we can do and what we can\\'t do,\" Spivey added.\\nAnd it\\'s not just large authorities which are struggling.\\nGloucester City Council is currently waiting to hear if the government will loan it £15.5m to help keep it solvent.\\nIt follows a cyber attack in 2021 and an over estimation of how much money its services and investments would make.\\nIn a statement the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG) said it inherited an \"outdated and unfair funding system\" which it is \"taking action\" to fix.\\nThis included \"making almost £78 billion available\" for council finances and £660 million for Gloucestershire.\\n\"We are delivering fairer funding, targeting money where it is needed most through the first multi-year settlement in a decade, giving councils greater certainty to plan and invest for the long term,\" the spokesperson added.\\n\"This will help councils deliver the high-quality public services local people need.\"\\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

I was having anger fits that I had no idea why,\" she said.\\nBarnett, who originally from Canada but has lived in Guernsey for 20 years, and said: \"The brain fog was extreme.\\n\"I could carry a meeting without any problems; but then I\\'d be sat there, not knowing what the name of something was that I\\'ve known for years, then you\\'re embarrassed, then the hot flushes come and the anxiety and overwhelm and it was just all too much.\\n\"There were days I cried because I couldn\\'t find my slippers.\"\\nShe said her experience was extreme and she felt she did not have anyone to talk to.\\n\"Every time I went back to the doctor they said: \\'Your levels are fine, you\\'re fine.\\'\\n\"But I would sit there in tears and think I\\'m not fine and I didn\\'t know why.\"\\nIn September 2025, she launched a business offering support to others in Guernsey because of her experience.\\nShe said many women feared the menopause because they feared \"the unknown\".\\nShe said: \"So, the more that we educate, the more that we talk about it, women aren\\'t going to fear it.\\n\"I\\'m a very outspoken person and I care about what happens to people.\\n\"It\\'s a support for women who maybe don\\'t know what\\'s going on with their bodies.\"\\nShe described the number of women that leave their jobs because of menopausal symptoms and a lack of support as \"outrageous\".\\nAccording to the British Menopause Society, 45% of women felt their menopause symptoms had a negative impact on their work.\\n\\nIn Jersey, Trudi Roscouet also created another business aiming to raise awareness of women\\'s health and offer support after she experienced the menopause at the age of 51.\\n\"Whether it\\'s our children, partners, bosses, it can affect everybody and everything,\" she said.\\nShe is also calling for more support in the workplace, highlighting how brain fog, anxiety and insomnia are the top three symptoms which affected women at work.\\n\"The big thing we need to do is keep educating the corporates to support female employees in the workplace - and not just once in a lifetime,\" she said.\\nUnder the UK Employment Rights Act 2025, all employers with more than 250 employees will be required to design and implement a menopause action plan to support menopause in the workplace and help women remain in employment.\\nVoluntary reporting is due to start in April 2026, with mandatory compliance by early 2027.\\nThe plans are required to have evidence-based steps, such as flexible working, temperature control and manager training to reduce workplace barriers.\\nIn May 2022, Jersey\\'s government signed up to becoming a menopause-friendly workplace by signing the 51 Employer Pledge.\\nThe 14-point pledge said menopause was to be treated with the same level of seriousness, care and support as other physical and mental health conditions, and that an individual approach should be taken and staff supported.\\nRoscouet said she believed there is more to be done, saying: \"I just don\\'t think the government are listening about women\\'s health anymore.\\n\"Menopause they believe has been dealt with.

       "  'Article': 'New evidence in the case of a man who has spent 23 years in prison for murder suggests he was framed by police, BBC Panorama has found.\\nPolice knew the testimony of the main prosecution witness in the trial of Omar Benguit for the murder of South Korean student Jong-Ok Shin was directly contradicted by CCTV evidence, we have learned.\\nA total of 13 other witnesses used to support the prosecution case have now told the BBC the police pressured them to embellish their statements or lie in court.\\nDorset Police did not directly address the suggestion that officers had framed Benguit, but said its investigation was \"thorough, detailed and very complex\".\\nJong-Ok Shin - known as Oki - was stabbed to death while she was walking home from a Bournemouth nightclub in 2002. Benguit, an addict with a history of drug and knife crime, was convicted at a third trial in 2005, after two previous juries failed to reach verdicts.\\nThe BBC has investigated this case over nine years, previously reporting that some witnesses had said they gave false evidence after being pressured by police. But Panorama\\'s latest investigation reveals:\\nPhone records suggest Benguit had an alibi that discredited the evidence of the main witness and the police buried it\\nPolice built their case around the testimony of a proven liar, even though they knew CCTV footage contradicted her story\\nTwo additional witnesses say they lied in court after police pressured them\\nFour more people told the BBC that officers had tried to get them to give false evidence and they refused\\nThe evidence of all the key prosecution witnesses has now been undermined or discredited\\nWitness testimony was crucial to the prosecution as there was no CCTV or forensic evidence linking Benguit to the crime.\\nAfter reviewing Panorama\\'s evidence, retired murder squad detective Brian Murphy called for the Independent Office for Police Conduct to investigate Dorset Police\\'s handling of the case.\\nThe former detective chief inspector, who has been involved in more than 200 murder investigations, said in his view Benguit\\'s conviction was not safe. \"This cries out for a review without a doubt,\" he said.\\nDes Jenson, Benguit\\'s barrister, said that if police had coerced witnesses to lie, \"it means that they have manufactured evidence, they\\'ve perverted the course of justice\".\\nThe murder led to intense pressure on Dorset Police, because Bournemouth\\'s economy relies heavily on international students and the South Korean government wanted the murderer caught.\\nThe police built their case against Omar Benguit around the testimony of a drug addict, who we are calling BB for legal reasons. She said she had been driving three people, including Benguit, on the night of the murder.\\nBB said she had stopped the car after passing Oki - and that all three men had gone to talk to her. They tried to persuade the student to come to a party and, when she refused, Benguit stabbed her, she said.\\nBB had a history of making false allegations and her account contradicted Oki\\'s dying testimony, that she had been stabbed by a single, masked attacker.\\nDuring the investigation, BB had also changed her story - initially accusing two other men, before naming Benguit in her third statement to the police.\\nPanorama has now discovered that police viewed CCTV footage during their investigation which discredited BB\\'s story.\\nIn her third and final statement, she claimed she had stopped at a BP garage on Charminster Road in Bournemouth before picking up Benguit and the others.\\nBut Panorama has found that when police checked CCTV cameras, they could not find any footage of BB or the men.\\nIt was the same with her description of what happened after the murder. She claimed she had driven the three men to what was then a crack house a mile away to get cleaned up.\\nThere was a CCTV camera across the road and police could see footage of addicts going in and out. But they did not find any evidence of BB, the three men or the car.\\nBB\\'s account was the only evidence placing Benguit at the murder scene, but her account was supported in court by witnesses who gave evidence about his actions before and after the murder. Most of them were also drug addicts.\\nLeanne is one of the witnesses who has previously admitted to lying in court. She was just 17 at the time and said she had been pressured into signing a false statement in the back of a police car.\\n\"I was a kid and I was thrown in the back of a car. I was petrified. There was already a statement wrote out,\" she said.\\n\"And then when they start asking me questions, they start crossing things out, putting other things in. It\\'s like they started with a template or something. This statement was their words, 95% of it.\"\\nPanorama has now obtained more evidence that suggests some officers may have been deliberately trying to frame Benguit.\\nPolice interviewed five drug addicts who had been at the crack house that night and they all initially denied having seen him there.\\nBut when they were re-interviewed months later, all five changed their stories in the same way. They all said they had seen Omar Benguit on the night of the murder and that he had been covered in blood.\\nIt was their evidence in court that helped to convict him.\\nOne of the crack house witnesses had already told the BBC she lied in court.\\nPanorama has now tracked down two more of them. One, who asked to remain anonymous, said the police pressured her to change key details.\\nThe second witness, Andi Miller, said BB had told the police about dozens of thefts they had committed together, and the police used that to get him to tell lies.\\n\"They had me bang to rights on jobs, you know what I mean?\" he said. \"And I never got charged for any of it. I felt as though the police pressurised me into saying something that wasn\\'t true.\"\\nThe BBC has also spoken to the family and friends of the last two crack house witnesses. They say the couple have admitted lying in court.\\nAlong with the 13 who told the BBC they were pressured to embellish their evidence or lie, that means the evidence of 15 key prosecution witnesses has now been discredited or undermined.\\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) is currently considering Omar Benguit\\'s case, after the BBC discovered CCTV evidence in 2021.\\nIt was grainy CCTV footage of a man who looked like Benguit using a phone box on Charminster Road about 25 minutes after the murder.\\nIf the man in the footage is him, then he cannot have been at the crack house cleaning up, as BB claimed.\\nThe CCRC discovered that 135 CCTV tapes from the original police investigation had gone missing.\\nThe commission has concluded it was possible that the man in the grainy phone box footage was Benguit, but it could not be sure.\\nNow, Panorama has uncovered new evidence that strengthens the possible alibi.\\nAt the time, Benguit and other addicts were regularly using the phone box on Charminster Road to arrange drug purchases with their dealer.\\nDocuments obtained by Panorama show a call was made from the phone box to Benguit\\'s dealer at the exact time that the man who looks like him was captured on CCTV.\\nThe combination of the CCTV footage and the phone records strongly suggests that Omar Benguit was in the phone box that night and has an alibi that disproves the crack house evidence.\\nThe programme has also discovered that the police were aware of this potential alibi at the time.\\nThey knew the man in the phone box resembled Benguit and they knew that a call had been made to his dealer at exactly the same time. Rather than investigating the alibi properly, police appear to have buried it.\\nCriminologist Barry Loveday, who has been researching the case for 20 years, said Dorset Police has serious questions to answer.\\n\"The police were highly selective in the way they collected evidence. In my opinion, Omar was framed. This was a quite elaborate frame-up,\" he said.\\nThere is a possible motive for the police to try to frame Benguit - their failure to stop a suspected murderer from killing again.\\nDanilo Restivo was suspected of murdering a 16-year-old student in Italy before he moved to England in 2002.\\nHe lived just three streets from where Oki was killed and he was an early suspect in her murder too.\\nA woman reported to police that she heard Restivo discussing details of Oki\\'s murder that had not been made public.\\nItalian police then warned Dorset Police about their suspicions, but detectives stopped investigating Restivo after his girlfriend gave him an alibi.\\nFour months later, Restivo killed his neighbour Heather Barnett in a brutal attack. It was another nine years before he was convicted of her murder and the earlier murder of 16-year-old Elisa Claps in Italy.\\nIn 2014, the Court of Appeal discounted Restivo as a suspect because Oki\\'s murder was different from the other two killings.\\nBut now Panorama has found a grainy CCTV image that could be him. It shows a man on a bike just around the corner from the murder scene and it was recorded about 10 minutes before Oki was killed.\\nPanorama wrote to Restivo about Oki\\'s murder, but he did not respond. Neither did BB.\\nOmar Benguit is now clean of drugs. Having served 23 years, he could now be eligible for parole if he admitted murdering Oki. But the 53-year-old told Panorama he could not confess to something he had not done.\\n\"I\\'d rather die in prison saying I didn\\'t do it, than get released now saying that I did do it. It\\'s not going to happen. I\\'m an innocent man. Why should I lie just to get out?\" he said.\\nA Dorset Police spokesperson said that Omar Benguit had appealed twice against his conviction and that his claims of wrongful conviction had been dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\\n\"This case has been through a series of reviews and any matter surrounding concerns regarding this conviction is ultimately a matter for the CCRC and the Court of Appeal,\" the spokesperson said.\\nThe force said it would \"instigate investigations if directed by the courts and responsible authorities\", adding: \"As always, our thoughts are with Oki\\'s family and friends who remain devastated by their loss.\"\\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

       "  'Article': 'Children have been \"weaponised\" by both sides of a toxic debate about transgender rights, the author of a government review into the treatment of children and young people questioning their gender has said.\\nDr Hilary Cass told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg \"people at the extremes\" had caused \"quite a lot of distress for young people\".\\nShe also suggested \"unrealistic images and expectations on social media\" had misled children, and that if some young people had \"taken more time\" they might not have pursued medical treatments.\\nHer 2024 review found gender medicine had been operating on \"shaky foundations\" when it came to evidence for medical treatment.\\nIn an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, she said there was a \"lack of realism about what transition would really mean and how hard it would be\" - pointing to \"quite intensive medical treatments\" and \"sometimes quite brutal surgeries\".\\nShe added: \"There are a tiny number of people who will never be comfortable with their biological sex, with the gender associated with their biological sex.\\n\"And for them, a medical pathway is the only way they\\'re going to live their life comfortably. And we don\\'t understand why that is, but we have to try and help those people thrive as much as the young people who are going to grow out of this.\"\\nThe review was commissioned after concerns about the treatment of growing numbers of children and young people with worries about their gender, particularly at the Tavistock Clinic in London\\nWhen asked how many children with distress about their gender would experience that same distress into adulthood, Cass said it was impossible to assess precisely, but it would be a \"really tiny number\".\\nThe paediatrician added: \"When the clinic started, there were about 50 children a year in the UK, and then by the time I started my review it had shot up to 3,500 a year.\\n\"We tried very hard to find out from the Tavistock what happened to the ones who didn\\'t go on medical pathway. They just didn\\'t follow them up and they didn\\'t have that data.\\n\"So that\\'s one chunk of children who don\\'t go on a medical pathway, then there are all the ones that me and parents and teachers will tell you about who go through two or three years of gender questioning and then desist.\"\\nAsked if children had been let down by an adult-led debate, Cass said \"absolutely\", adding they \"were also caught up in all the issues about single-sex spaces and sports and safe areas for women which were actually not to do with the children but they were somehow part of a football within it\".\\n\"That\\'s a real shame that children have been weaponised.\"\\nThe vast majority of people in the middle of the debate were silent while the \"people at the extremes\" and rhetoric in the media had been \"frightening for young people,\" the clinician said.\\nShe added that some activists for trans rights had been \"so strident that it\\'s made it more difficult for trans people themselves who are just trying to live under the radar\", while equally people who had taken the view no-one should ever transition had \"similarly made it difficult\".\\nCass, who praised the government\\'s guidance for schools in England published earlier this week, said it was important for there to be caution about very young children beginning the transitioning process because \"if they socially transition too early we think they can get locked onto a trajectory that may not have been the correct natural trajectory for them\".\\nAsked about why the number of children and young people who have gender dysphoria is increasing, Cass said it was \"complex\" but there was a different cultural context, with people \"less locked into gender stereotypes\".\\n\"I think what has kind of misled children is the belief that if you are not a typical girl, if you like playing with trucks, or boys who like dressing up or that you have same-sex attraction that means that you\\'re trans and actually it\\'s not like that but those are all normal variations,\" she said.\\n\"I think children and young people were being given a narrative that it\\'s not okay to be anything but absolutely typical of the other girls on Instagram.\"\\nCass also said it was \"vital\" that a controversial trial of puberty blockers for under-16s went ahead, or \"we\\'re going to have ongoing charlatans just handing out inappropriate drugs\", pointing to the private sale of the drugs - particularly online.\\nPuberty blockers - which suppress the hormones that cause puberty - are often prescribed to children questioning their gender as a way of stopping physical changes such as breast development or facial hair.\\nThey were banned for under-18s after the Cass review raised concerns about their safety, but a clinical trial to assess their safety was announced last year.\\nCampaigners have questioned the ethics of it, while the charity Stonewall said it was \"vitally important\" that all LGBTQ+ people have access to high-quality, evidence-based and timely healthcare.\\nCass denied that she had stopped young people and families getting the help they needed, saying the new centres would make sure people had \"individualised treatment\".\\n\"The biggest hurdle at the moment is they are still working through the big backlog,\" she said.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'It\\'s nearly 200 years since the birth of a British aristocrat who became the first Muslim member of the House of Lords.\\nBut few have heard of Lord Henry Stanley, who \"defied convention and his family\\'s wishes\" when he converted to Islam in 1859, according to historian Jamie Gilham.\\nLittle remains of Stanley\\'s letters and diaries \"which is really frustrating but adds to the idea that he was a private man,\" he said.\\nSince medieval times, a relatively small number of Brits had become Muslims while travelling abroad.\\nBut Gilham said Stanley was notable as he had influence politically and on his lands in Cheshire and Anglesey.\\nBorn in 1827, Stanley was the eldest of 10 children given free rein to develop their own thoughts and beliefs.\\nThe wider family, whose aristocratic ancestors can be traced to Norman times, had members belonging to various Christian denominations and at least one who was Jewish during Victorian times.\\nFamily historian Lady Stanley of Alderley, who is married to the current Lord Stanley, said they were \"free thinking\" and born to educated, well-travelled mothers.\\n\"They were people who did things,\" she added. \"It was acceptable to be argumentative.\\n\"Thinking, debate, discussions were OK as opposed to a \\'get off my land, I\\'m going shooting\\' attitude.\"\\nLike many educated Victorians, Stanley was dazzled as a child by travelogues and the Arabian Nights tales.\\nHe also had a hearing impairment which affected his schooling, and he left Eton after one year to study with a private tutor.\\nGilham said Stanley\\'s father, who was an MP, and his mother - who helped establish the first women\\'s college at Cambridge University - had \"great expectations for their first-born\".\\nHowever his struggles with hearing meant \"his family worried greatly about his future prospects\".\\n\"He only really started to shine when he went to Cambridge and learned Arabic,\" Gilham added.\\nWithin a year, the 20-year-old was employed as an assistant to the then Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston in 1847.\\nOver the following decade, Stanley worked for the diplomatic service, with postings in the Turkish-based Ottoman Empire, as well as Greece and Bulgaria.\\n\"Stanley came to appreciate the social and the spiritual benefits Islam provided the Ottomans,\" Gilham said.\\nIt was also a time when various European empires were reaching their peak yet faced republican or nationalistic revolts.\\n\"From letters, we see that Stanley experienced both political and spiritual crises,\" Gilham added.\\n\"He didn\\'t lose faith in God but he certainly had theological doubts. He did question the literal accuracy of the Bible, for example, and the letters between his parents show that he didn\\'t go to church for the first time in his life.\\n\"Unusually for Britain in the mid-Victorian period, Stanley did gravitate towards Islam - the religion of the Ottoman Turks - and symbolically at that time, around 1849-50, he gave up wine.\"\\nDisillusioned with Britain\\'s expanding imperialism, Stanley quit the diplomatic service in 1858 and decided to become a Muslim some months later while travelling in Arabia.\\n\"There\\'s little account of his religious conversion and beliefs,\" Gilham said. \"It\\'s just things that you can read in some of the family letters.\"\\nPress reports of Stanley\\'s conversion emerged in Sri Lanka on his visit there in 1859, before news travelled back home to Cheshire - where it was reported in the local Macclesfield Courier and then the national outlets in London.\\nSome reported that he made a pilgrimage to Islam\\'s holiest site in Mecca and adopted the name Abdul Rahman - Arabic for \"servant of the merciful Lord\" - although evidence is unclear, Gilham added.\\n\"Letters show his parents were absolutely furious and equally embarrassed and humiliated that their son would convert to Islam from Christianity.\\n\"His father said to his mother, \\'Is he mad?

He did defy convention in many respects - and a crucial respect in terms of religion - but in other ways he didn\\'t.\"\\nLord Stanley died at the age of 76 during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in 1903 and was buried in unconsecrated ground on his Alderley estate, in a service led by an imam from the Ottoman Embassy in London.\\n\"In some respects he was ahead of his time and he is starting slowly to be recognised and reclaimed to some extent,\" said Gilham.\\n\"He was not showy and maybe that was to the detriment of his legacy but I hope people will start to recognise him a little more than maybe he has been so far.\"\\nRead more stories from Cheshire on the BBC, watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer and follow BBC North West on X.

Patrick was clinically dead for 40 minutes. His wife performed CPR, while his daughter and son, then nine and seven, ran to get help.\\nParamedics\\' defibrillation attempts failed. With his life slipping away, they tried adrenaline shots as a \"kind of final roll of the dice\", says Patrick.\\nThey \"shocked and shocked and shocked [me]\", he adds. His wife began to suspect he was lost.\\nThen suddenly his heart began beating again.\\nPatrick awoke from his week-long coma a changed man, with a brain injury that affects his sight, memory and stamina.\\nUnable to work and live as he did before, he feels it\\'s allowed him to be more present in life and relationships.\\nIt\\'s a perspective shift, he tells Emma Barnett\\'s Ready to Talk podcast, that he \"wouldn\\'t change\" - even if given the chance to return to his old life.\\nStill the journey to today\\'s acceptance has been deeply traumatic.\\n\"I woke up blind,\" says Patrick of his first waking memory. \"I was experiencing these things, but not really connecting with them.\"\\nThe loss of his eyesight sparked vivid hallucinations. Known as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, the phenomenon is the brain\\'s way of \"filling in\" sudden missing visual data.\\nWhile some of these were \"frightening\" he says others felt \"great\" and strangely beautiful.\\nIn one, after his open heart surgery, he became convinced an American nurse was trying to murder him.\\nBut these hallucinations could also provide calm. One took him to a sanitorium in the Alps, where he looked out across the snowy mountains while nurses chatted next door. The experience gave him a \"blissful\" sense of safety.\\nAs his vision slowly returned, doctors realised his sight issues were linked to a brain injury. His eyesight remains partially impaired, comparable to \"looking through a telescope\".\\nInitial cognitive tests put him in the bottom 2% across memory and processing speed. Although vastly improved, he still has significant cognitive problems.\\nBut the full impact of his injuries only became apparent once he returned home.\\nSevere fatigue means he has to budget his energy. \"I never, ever wake up feeling refreshed. I wake up exhausted every day, and it gets worse as the day goes on,\" he explains.\\nThere have also been mental changes to adjust to. Patrick found he \"didn\\'t care about anything\" after his initial recovery. This wasn\\'t depression per se, but a condition known as pathological apathy that Patrick describes as feeling like \"floating through time\" without solid ground.\\n\\nTherapy and medication have helped to revive his motivation, with a psychologist encouraging him to grieve the life he\\'d lost. Still, Patrick says he misses the spontaneity of life, and fitting in with people his age by \"participating in society\" as expected, as well as actively playing with his children.\\nHe also feels regret for his wife, who he feels he\\'s \"outsourced\" his memory to. \"The truth is that she is my carer, really,\" he admits.\\n\"I sort of live as if I\\'m really very, very old.\"\\nDespite the vast changes, Patrick says in many ways he prefers this life. He has changed careers to become an author and says he now has more time to enjoy life.\\n\"I live life slowly now, not by choice, but because I have to. But I really appreciate that. I do see the beauty in things much more than I used to… I feel like I live a much richer existence by being slower,\" he says.\\n\"My perspective has fundamentally altered. I feel grateful to be alive\".\\nHis relationship with his family has also changed for the better.\\nHe is able to laugh at the quirks of his condition with them. \"I think we\\'re more solid than ever, really… we have a much closer bond because of what\\'s happened,\" he adds.\\n\"The most important thing to me has always been my family, but now I am able to give so much more of myself to it. Before I was living almost on the surface of it,\" he says.\\nPatrick\\'s unique situation has allowed him to break free of the daily work grind.\\n\"So many people feel like that… I\\'m too busy to live my life.

Previously he has strongly denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein and rejected any suggestion he used his time as trade envoy to further his own interests.\\nSir Vince Cable, who was business secretary at the time, described sharing the briefing as \"appalling behaviour\".\\nThames Valley Police are already assessing whether to investigate the apparent sharing of documents related to Andrew\\'s time as trade envoy.\\nIn a new statement on Wednesday, police said: \"We can confirm today that Thames Valley Police is leading the ongoing assessment of allegations relating to misconduct in public office.\\n\"As part of this assessment, we have engaged in discussions with Specialist Crown Prosecutors from the CPS. We will provide updates as and when they are available, but at this stage it would be inappropriate to discuss further specifics of this work.\\n\"During an assessment phase, information is evaluated to determine whether a criminal offence is suspected and whether a full investigation is required. Allegations of misconduct in public office involve particular complexities, and therefore an assessment must be conducted carefully and thoroughly.\"\\nAs well as the Afghan document, Andrew also seems to have sent the disgraced financier official reports from his visits as a trade envoy to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam, according to emails in the Epstein files seen by the BBC.\\nEmails in the files raise the possibility Andrew shared further trade documents with Epstein. One message indicates that a few seconds after sending the reports from the South East Asia visits, the former prince then sent a second batch of files called \"Overseas bids\".\\nThese seem to be \"Zip files\" that usually contain many compressed pieces of information.\\nThe Afghan document, which is in the Epstein files, was compiled by UK government officials specifically for the then Duke of York.\\nIt provides an extensive overview of investment opportunities in Helmand province, at a time when the UK was militarily and politically committed to rebuilding Afghanistan.\\nAs Andrew said in his note to Epstein, it\\'s a \"confidential brief produced by the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand Province\".\\nIt was a briefing produced for Andrew - who was trade envoy between 2001 and 2011 - in the same month that he visited Helmand, where he saw UK troops based there.\\nIt gives an assessment of the current local economy and the business opportunities, including \"significant high value mineral deposits\" and the \"potential for low cost extraction\".\\nThis includes valuable natural resources such as marble, gold, iridium, uranium and thorium and also possible deposits of oil and gas, with the information prepared by UK government officials, working for the Helmand reconstruction team.\\nAccording to official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.\\n\\nSir Vince, who was seen as instrumental in ending Andrew\\'s time as trade envoy, called for more transparency on Andrew\\'s time as trade envoy.\\n\"I have twice in the past asked to see the file on Andrew as trade envoy and, strangely, it is empty,\" he said.\\n\"I met Andrew once as secretary of state, when I was invited to Buckingham Palace and he was asking me to find something useful for him to do. I didn\\'t.\\n\"Shortly after, in 2011, the first publicity appeared about his friend Epstein and I discontinued the envoy role,\" said Sir Vince.\\nThe role of trade envoy is to promote the UK\\'s business interests overseas and to encourage investment.\\nSpeaking anonymously, a diplomatic source suggested that an envoy such as Andrew might legitimately have shared information with potential investors, encouraging them to support UK international business initiatives, which might have included in Afghanistan.\\nAndrew\\'s apparent note to Epstein says he is going to \"offer this elsewhere in my network (including Abu Dhabi)\".\\nOn the wider principle of sharing documents, a former senior trade official said many of the reports seen by a trade envoy would have been quite \"pedestrian\", but sometimes the former Duke of York had \"really important meetings with really important people\" that produced real commercial opportunities.\\n\"So it is always possible that there were significant commercial things in the documents which would have been useful,\" the former official said.\\n\"They were absolutely not for sending outside government and particularly not to somebody who might seek to use them for commercial purposes. This was certainly not something a trade envoy could possibly do and justify in any way.\"\\nThe former prince continues to be dogged by his links to Epstein after the latest tranche of documents released by the US government included pictures of Mountbatten-Windsor, fully clothed, kneeling on all fours over a woman lying on the ground.\\nHe is facing growing pressure to testify in the US about his links to Epstein and last week moved from his Windsor home to the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.\\nOn Monday a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was ready to support the police as they consider allegations against his brother.\\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

Police later said that one of the victims died from a gunshot fired by police.\\nThe CST said more than half of the incidents it recorded across both days involved direct reactions to the attack, including celebrating it.\\nOf these 42 incidents, three involved \"face-to-face taunting and celebration of the attack to Jewish people\", and 39 took place online. These included antisemitic social media posts referencing the attack, abusive responses to public condemnations of the attack from Jewish organisations and individuals, or antagonistic emails sent to Jewish people and institutions.\\nThe killings in Manchester were the first fatal antisemitic terror attack in the UK since the CST began recording incidents in 1984.\\nAccording to the CST report, there were 3,700 anti-Jewish hate incidents recorded in 2025, up 4% from 3,556 in 2024. Last year saw the second highest annual total ever, second only to 2023 when there were 4,298.\\nThe total for 2023 included 416 incidents in the week following Hamas\\'s 7 October attacks on Israel - a larger number than any subsequent week.\\nThough 2023 saw the highest total number of incidents, last year was the first time more than 200 cases of anti-Jewish hate were recorded in every calendar month.\\nLast year also saw the highest ever recorded number of cases of damage and desecration to Jewish property - including damage to the homes and vehicles of Jewish people and to synagogues.\\nThere were 217 such incidents in 2025, up 38% from 157 in 2024.\\nCST chief executive Mark Gardner described the attack in Manchester as the culmination of \"two years of intense anti-Jewish hatred\".\\nHe said: \"The terror attack then triggered even more antisemitism, showing the depths of extremism faced by Jews and all our British society.\"\\nChief Constable Mark Hobrough, the national policing lead for hate crime, said 2025 had seen \"unacceptably high\" levels of antisemitic hate.\\nHe added: \"The tensions that exist in our society have not abated and are both deeper and more long-standing than anything we have experienced in modern times.\"\\nThe CST said there was also a spike in reports on the day of the Bondi Beach killings in Sydney in December, and on the two following days.\\nOf the 50 incidents across those three days, just under half (21) directly referenced the Bondi attack, the CST said.\\n\\nLord John Mann, the government\\'s independent adviser on antisemitism, said it was \"particularly troubling\" to see the large number of incidents that had taken place immediately after the Manchester attack.\\nOverall, he said the latest figures were \"deeply alarming and illustrate the unrelenting nature of antisemitism in our country today\".\\nHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the latest numbers were \"shocking\" and the government \"stands against the scourge of antisemitism\".\\nShe added: \"We are providing record funding for security at synagogues, Jewish schools and community centres.

There, he answered questions about the paper\\'s use of private investigators to obtain information.\\nOn Tuesday Dacre was back in court, facing similar questions from the same barrister, David Sherborne, who is representing the seven claimants.\\nDacre told the trial that he \"wasn\\'t aware\" of the extent of the paper\\'s use of private investigators - who he referred to as \"inquiry agents\" - until around 2007 when he \"brought the shutters down\".\\nSherborne asked Dacre whether his involvement in the case \"is motivated by a desire to protect your legacy\" rather than getting a fair outcome. Dacre admitted wanting to clear his name, but also said he cared about the \"honest and dedicated\" staff at the paper.\\nRegarding allegations that hacking and tapping phones was \"habitual and widespread\" at the Daily Mail, Dacre said: \"I utterly reject this. Such blatant illegality would not, I believe, have been countenanced at any level on the paper I edited.\"\\nHe added that he is sure if he was told there was evidence a journalist or agent had blagged information, he would \"have been pretty furious\".\\nThe \"sometimes preposterous allegations\" have \"in the small hours of the night – reduced me to rage\" he wrote in his witness statement, adding that they have had a \"deeply upsetting and, in some instances, traumatic impact\" on past and present Daily Mail staff.\\nAnother of the claimants, Baroness Lawrence, is the mother of the murdered black schoolboy Stephen Lawrence.

This page only displays data as it is presented in the latest release.\\nONS figures for immigration and emigration are update twice per year.\\nSmall boats figures from the Home Office are updated daily. Asylum, returns and visa figures from the Home Office are updated every three months.\\nThe number of people appealing against a refused asylum decision is updated every three months by the Ministry of Justice at a different time to other government figures on asylum.\\n\\nImmigration, emigration and net migration\\nFigures for net migration come from the ONS and use the internationally recognised definition of a long-term migrant: \"a person who moves to a country other than that of their usual residence for at least a year.\"\\n\\nVisas for legal migration\\nData for total entries via visas only includes those granted. It does not include people coming to the UK on a visitor visa or those on a transit visa - whose final destination is not the UK.\\nVisa figures do not show if or when an individual arrived in the UK, but marks the point at which they were granted permission to do so.\\nIf someone was granted more than one visa within the year shown, each one is counted separately.\\nThe work category refers to new individuals linked to visas and permits, or the extension of an existing permission. This includes sub-categories such as seasonal, health and care, domestic and youth mobility visas.\\nStudy visas include all sponsored individuals by approved education providers in the UK, and those on short-term study visas.\\nFamily visas lets someone come to the UK or stay longer so they can live with close family members who are already here.

She alleged she was made to have sex with him as a teenager.\\nBut in an email apparently written by Epstein\\'s associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is also in the image, in 2015, she said: \"In 2001 I was in London when [redacted] met a number of friends of mine including Prince Andrew. A photograph was taken as I imagine she wanted to show it to friends and family.\"\\nHe has always denied the claim and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022. It contained no admission of liability or apology.\\nThames Valley Police has confirmed it is assessing allegations reported by the BBC that a second woman says she was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with Mountbatten-Windsor.\\nThe encounter allegedly occurred at his former Royal Lodge residence in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.\\nOther emails appear to show Mountbatten-Windsor knowingly shared confidential information with Epstein from his official work as a trade envoy in 2010 and 2011.\\nUnder official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.\\nBut emails show the former prince passing on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam, and confidential details of investment opportunities, to Epstein.\\nThe Royal Family has sought to distance itself from Andrew, beginning in 2019 when it was announced he would step back from royal duties.\\nSince then, he has lost his titles, military offices and official roles, and has only very occasionally been seen at official events.\\nBut there has been continued pressure on the Palace to signal a clean break from Andrew as public anger over his alleged conduct continues.\\n'},\n",

Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct.\\nThe emails indicate that on 7 October 2010, Andrew sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong, where he was accompanied by business associates of Epstein.\\nAfter the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then-special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.\\n\\nAndrew told BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he last saw Epstein in New York in early December 2010 to tell the disgraced financier he was breaking off the friendship.\\nHowever, on Christmas Eve that year, he emailed Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money.\\nBy this time, Epstein was already a convicted sex offender.\\nSir Vince Cable, who was then business secretary, said: \"I was unaware of Andrew... sharing information about investment opportunities [in Afghanistan] before, this is the first I\\'ve heard of it.\"\\nIn a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew suggests Epstein might invest in a private equity firm he visited a week before.\\nOfficial terms of reference for trade envoys state that they \"are not civil servants\", adding: \"However, the role of a Trade Envoy carries with it a duty of confidentiality in relation to information received. This may include sensitive, commercial, or political information shared about relevant markets/visits.\\n\"This duty of confidentiality will continue to apply after the expiry of their term of office. In addition, the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1989 will apply.\"\\nAndrew has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein.\\nHe was stripped of his royal titles in October last year following increasing numbers of questions about his links to the late, convicted sex offender.\\nEarlier in February, Andrew moved out of his home in Windsor to the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.\\nBuckingham Palace had announced in October that he would be moving from Royal Lodge, at the same time his title of prince was removed.\\nThe former prince left the property on Monday night and is currently living at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate while his new permanent home undergoes renovations.\\n'},\n",

What are you wearing?\" He was not sure if I was kidding or not,\" says Siegal.\\nAndrew, who later described it as a \"small dinner party, there were only eight or 10 of us I think\", was said to have fended off requests for wedding invitations to Westminster Abbey.\\nAmong the guests, according to the emails, were Woody Allen and his wife Soon-Yi, TV presenters Katie Couric and George Stephanopoulos, comedian Chelsea Handler and talk show host Charlie Rose.\\nWithin days of the dinner party, details about the guests and their conversations had appeared in the US press - and the latest emails show an article being shared between Epstein and Siegal, with Epstein not happy with what seemed to have been a briefing to a journalist.\\n\"Not good for andrew, not good for me,\" Epstein emailed about the apparent insider details being leaked.\\nThe article claimed that Couric had told Andrew she would be broadcasting from outside the wedding and asked: \"If I e-mail your BlackBerry, will you give me the details on what is happening inside?\"\\nAndrew is quoted as saying that the Royal Family were delighted with the approaching marriage and that \"Kate is a terrific girl.\"\\nWoody Allen has played down his attendance at the event for Andrew.\\n\"Someone, a publicist, invited Soon-Yi and me to a dinner at Jeffrey\\'s house with one of those British royals. I can\\'t remember the name because I don\\'t follow the royals with any interest at all,\" he told the Sunday Times last autumn.\\nBut other emails in the released files show multiple exchanges between Allen and Epstein, including Allen talking to him about film makers.\\n\"If you don\\'t like Bergman, which I know you don\\'t, that\\'s fine. I\\'m sure he\\'s way too sophisticated for your taste. Should I now get you the box set on Bergman\\'s movies?\" messages Allen to Epstein.\\nIn another exchange Allen seems to be extolling the virtues of a new iPhone. \"I absolutely love this phone. Thank you, thank you, thank you,\" he says to Epstein.\\nThe latest emails also show Allen\\'s comments to Epstein about another dinner in December 2017.\\n\"Thank you for dinner last night. Just so you know, in the future, food should always be served very hot; never lukewarm.;)\" wrote Allen.\\nThere is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing\\nChelsea Handler has said that the dinner party was the only time she met Epstein and remembers Andrew being there and has joked about her own nervous comment to Woody Allen.\\n\"Yeah, we had dinner and it was so awkward and so weird... I was like what are we doing here? And then I asked Woody Allen how he and Soon Yi met and that was when I left,\" she recalled in a podcast in 2021.\\nSoon Yi was the adopted daughter of Allen\\'s former partner Mia Farrow.\\nThe Manhattan dinner was the same week that Epstein and Andrew were photographed together in Central Park.\\nIn Andrew\\'s account of his relationship with Epstein, he had gone to New York to end their connection, because it was more \"honourable\" to finish things in person.\\nOn Newsnight in 2019 he recounted what he\\'d said to Epstein in December 2010.\\n\"Look, because of what has happened, I don\\'t think it is appropriate that we should remain in contact,\" and by mutual agreement during that walk in the park we decided that we would part company and I left, I think it was the next day and to this day I never had any contact with him from that day forward,\" said Andrew in his TV interview.\\nThe latest emails suggest a different outcome.\\nAfter he was back from the trip, an account that seems to be Andrew emailed Epstein: \"It was great to spend time with my US family. Looking forward to joining you all again soon.\\n\"I\\'ll call you tomorrow... as I am moving the family up to Sandringham during the day.\"\\nThere was an ongoing conversation about trying to sort out unpaid wages for Sarah Ferguson\\'s staff, which was sufficiently annoying for \"the Duke\" to email Epstein: \"God it\\'s cold and dank here! Wish I was still a pet in your family.\"\\nRather than the claimed irrevocable goodbye to Epstein, as the year ended Andrew sent an optimistic message: \"Wishing you a wonderful Christmas and spectacular entry into 2011.\"\\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

He was also a director of the St George\\'s House Trust, based in Windsor Castle, from 2016 until 2022.\\nIn April 2017, Stern emails Epstein - nearly a decade after his conviction - to say that he was organising a \"super\" dinner at Windsor Castle in May that year, asking \"who else\" he should invite.\\nIn another email, dated the same day, Epstein appears to have the power to directly invite another business associate of his to the Windsor dinner, writing: \"I know you hate london do [sic] want a dinner invite at windsor castle with the top Chinese. biz people? may 26\".\\nThe recipient asks Epstein if he will be present at the dinner, to which he responds: \"no, I have a havard [sic] event\", potentially implying he was invited but unable to attend.\\nThe emails suggest that Epstein continued to have a much more influential and closer relationship with Mountbatten-Windsor and royal residences in the years after the former Duke had claimed to BBC Newsnight to have cut contact with him in December 2010.\\nIn 2014, Stern messages Epstein to say that \"PA [Prince Andrew] sends his birthday wishes and love\" alongside a picture of him with the then-Duke and Duchess of York.\\nThe message apparently from Stern also wishes Epstein \"Happy Birthday\" and shares a crude photo of champagne being poured down a naked woman, adding: \"Champagne for you (even though you don\\'t drink it)\".\\nHe appears to keep in frequent contact with Epstein about his work and access to the Palace, emailing Epstein in 2010 that he was at Prince Andrew\\'s \"birthday party\" and boasting about the famous celebrities he had encountered.\\nOther emails seem to show that Stern had also acted around this time as a conduit between Epstein and Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of York.\\nIn 2011, emails include one from Stern\\'s account which sent Epstein a message from \"Sarah\" mentioning \"The Duke\", in which she congratulates him on the apparent birth of a \"baby boy\".\\nAfter the crash of a business venture in 2009, Ferguson also appears to write to Epstein: \"I urgently need 20,000 pounds ($27,521) for rent today\" following an exchange with Stern, which she is copied into.\\nA spokesman for Sarah Ferguson previously told the BBC that she was told to congratulate Epstein on a baby but has no knowledge beyond that.\\nFurther emails, as part of the three million published last week, also shed new light on Epstein\\'s apparent invitation to have dinner with \"The Duke\" at Buckingham Palace in 2010, and that the sex offender requested to bring three women along with him.\\nOn 27 September that year, Epstein emails \"The Duke\" to say that he is in London and asks what time Mountbatten-Windsor would like him and a woman, who the BBC is not naming.\\n\"The Duke\" suggests they could have \"dinner\" at Buckingham Palace and \"lots of privacy\", to which Epstein agrees, responding that he is with three women.\\nEpstein asks if he should \"bring them all, so as to add some life\", in the email exchanges. \"Yes. Plenty of space here for chat! Bring them,\" says \"The Duke\".\\nIn a previous email, sent months prior, Epstein had described one of the women as \"a great friend\" and \"very pretty\" after \"The Duke\" asked who she was.\\nAnother email, sent the evening before the dinner, appears to show that Epstein had also personally invited a fourth woman to the Buckingham Palace meet-up, asking if she wanted to join and that she agreed.\\nThe BBC has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising out of his association with Epstein.\\nThe BBC has spent days trying to contact Stern for comment.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'After a bruising week, it\\'s hard to overstate the mess that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Sarah Ferguson find themselves in.\\nBut increasingly it appears it\\'s a mess their daughters also can\\'t escape.\\nThe newly released emails indicate that Jeffrey Epstein had a bigger presence than previously thought in the lives of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.\\nOne exchange suggests they had lunch with him in Miami, just days after his release from prison for prostituting minors. Elsewhere, it appears they were called upon by him to entertain his contacts and give tours of Buckingham Palace.\\nFor Beatrice, now 37, and Eugenie, 35, these new revelations could put their future under scrutiny.\\n\"It will raise questions from the public about just what they were doing,\" says royal commentator Richard Palmer.\\nBut royal journalist Victoria Murphy says while the emails make for \"really, really uncomfortable reading\", there continues to be sympathy towards the princesses.\\nAnd there\\'s no doubt that seeing a picture apparently of your father on all fours, crouching over a young woman, can only be deeply embarrassing.\\nIt should be said Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing, and being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.\\nSo after the York family brand has been dragged through the mud, where do the princesses now fit within the Royal Family?\\nBoth princesses are repeatedly mentioned in the latest dump of Epstein files.\\nMedia reports of the alleged lunch in Miami have often referred to \"the girls\", suggesting they were younger than they were.\\nAt the time of that visit Eugenie was 19 and Beatrice was 21.\\n\"They weren\\'t five-year-old girls when they were taken to see Epstein. They were grown ups,\" argues author Andrew Lownie, who wrote the book Entitled about Andrew. \"There\\'s a big campaign to say they are innocents caught up in the shellfire, but they\\'re not, they\\'re deeply involved.\"\\nBut Murphy disagrees with that portrayal, arguing it\\'s understandable to see why they went along with it.\\n\"It\\'s easy to be critical of that decision now that Epstein\\'s crimes are front and centre, but if no-one was raising any flags for them at the time you can see how they would just have gone on the trip their mother organised.\"\\nThe perks of being friends with Jeffrey Epstein are also apparent.\\nAn exchange between Epstein and his assistant seems to suggest he paid for the family\\'s flights, totalling \"for all tickets: $14,080.10\".\\nBut it was not all one way.\\nOn several occasions Epstein appears to ask Ferguson if her daughters can meet people, and on one appears to ask for them to show the redacted person Buckingham Palace.\\nOnce, Ferguson apologises, saying they were not around and explaining their whereabouts.\\nIn another extraordinary exchange, a \"Sarah\" appears to refer to Eugenie\\'s love life - saying she is returning from a \"shagging weekend\".\\nIn some of the emails, Epstein\\'s contacts also refer to the princesses.\\nOne email, sent to Epstein from a friend, reads: \"Just spoke to Duchess of Pork. She is at this wild lunch with Beatrice. I just introduced myself to her. Told her 1 know (barely) her father and how terrific he is...more later.\"\\nFerguson\\'s representatives have been asked for comment.\\nBut for Palmer, the repeated mentions of both princesses in the emails \"makes it difficult to distance themselves\" from the saga. \"There\\'s no avoiding the links between the Yorks and Epstein,\" he says.\\nNeither of the sisters are working royals. Both are married with children, and have their own careers. But like other royals both princesses also have philanthropic endeavours.\\nEugenie co-founded the Anti-Slavery Collective, a charity whose focus includes victims of sex trafficking.\\n\"It\\'s a preposterously inappropriate cause for [Eugenie] to be involved with,\" said Lownie.\\nAccording to the most recently available accounts, donations have slumped - from £1.5m in 2024 to £48,000 in the year ending 2025, although it has a healthy sum of money in reserves. No income was raised from events or auctions in the year to 2025, compared with the previous financial year when a major gala fundraiser was held.\\nThe charity has said that it hopes to hold a similar gala every three years. But a source from the sector has said it is \"difficult optically to do anything high profile like that again\".\\n\"Unsurprisingly, it\\'s keeping a low profile,\" they added.\\nBBC News has approached the Anti-Slavery Collective multiple times to ask for a comment in light of the latest controversy surrounding Andrew and Epstein, but it has not responded.\\nWe also approached a number of other charities the princesses are involved with, asking whether they retain their confidence in light of the recent emails.\\nOutward Bound said Princess Beatrice is involved with the group \"in her honorary role as Deputy Patron\".\\nBut Salvation Army, which has a long-standing partnership with Eugenie, struck a more cautious note. \"We place victims and survivors at the heart of all our decision making and we are closely monitoring this story,\" a spokesperson said.\\nAway from their charity work, the princesses both also have jobs.\\nBeatrice founded advisory firm BY-EQ, while Eugenie works as a director at the art gallery Hauser & Wirth in Mayfair.\\nIt has recently faced legal challenges regarding alleged breaches of Russian sanctions, though it strongly contests these accusations. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Eugenie. Southwark Crown Court told BBC News the trial date had been set for 2028.\\nLast year, around the time her father lost his prince title, Beatrice was pictured at an investment summit in Saudi Arabia. Her family have long-held links to the Middle East and she also recently appeared in a promotional picture for a UAE bank.\\nBeatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi have also been involved in some of her father\\'s business activities. They were present at Pitch@Palace, Andrew\\'s start up business network, and were pictured meeting the then-Chinese ambassador to the UK in 2020, alongside her parents.\\nPalmer suggests there may have been a blurring of royal role and personal profit.\\nThe princess, he said, built her career off the back of her royal status and introductions her parents gave her, \"meeting all sorts of business contacts and members of royal families abroad\".\\nBoth princesses have independently wealthy husbands, and two children each.\\nBeatrice\\'s husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi is a property developer, descended from Italian nobility, while Eugenie\\'s, Jack Brooksbank, has worked in hospitality and marketing.\\nBeatrice splits her time between her Cotswolds property and an apartment in St James\\' Palace. Eugenie lives between Portugal and Ivy Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.\\nIt is understood the princesses do pay rent on their royal properties. But the Palace would not confirm if it is paid at a market rate. It comes at a time of mounting calls for wider transparency about royal finances, following the outcry over Andrew\\'s lease agreement at his former Windsor mansion.\\nThis week, Andrew moved to the King\\'s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, which means he is no longer close to his daughters and grandchildren. At present Ferguson\\'s whereabouts are unknown, although there has been speculation she may move to Portugal to live with her younger daughter.\\nPrivately, the princesses remain in touch with their parents, says Palmer. \"From what I understand, they are still speaking to them,\" he says, \"and want to remain loyal to them.\"\\nBut in public, he says, they will keep their distance. \"They need to separate themselves publicly from their parents, otherwise [they] risk the toxicity spreading further to them.\"\\nWhen Andrew lost his titles, Beatrice and Eugenie kept theirs. There is also no change to the line of succession.\\nBut some have questioned where they now fit within the wider Royal Family.\\nThe sisters have always been said to be close to the Prince of Wales and Duke of Sussex and have shared what it is like to grow up in the limelight.\\nEugenie is reported to have been particularly close to Harry, and travelled to California to visit him.\\nFootage in the Harry and Meghan documentary showed her attending the Super Bowl, going on bike rides with her cousin and playing with his son Archie on a beach.\\nLike Harry, both Beatrice and Eugenie have now found themselves on the outskirts of the family. But even in recent years, with their father\\'s disgrace hanging over them, they have continued to attend, and be part of, royal occasions.\\nThe biggest question mark for many, was where they would spend this past Christmas.\\nUntil the last minute, it was unclear whether the princesses would appear at Sandringham. But in the end, they did - choosing to spend Christmas Day with the wider Royal Family, rather than with their parents in disgrace at Royal Lodge.\\nFor Lownie, it\\'s a clear sign that a deal was struck between Andrew and the King - that he and Ferguson would \"go quietly\", so long as their daughters were protected.\\nBut what\\'s also clear is that they wouldn\\'t have been there if King Charles had not wanted them there. Their appearance gives us an insight into how the Palace is seeing things: Beatrice and Eugenie are still members of the Royal Family. They are still in the firm, and will be looked after.\\nAs the Royal Family walked the short distance from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church for the Christmas Day service, both Beatrice and Eugenie, alongside their husbands, were prominent among the group, just behind the King and Queen.\\nIt is, perhaps, a sign of how they intend to move forward amid the Epstein fallout.\\nUntil now, the princesses have always been seen as part of a package, together with Andrew and Ferguson as part of the House of York.\\nWhatever happens next, Beatrice and Eugenie will need to step out from their shadow if they are to continue to be an active part of the Royal Family.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The government unlawfully trespassed in a barrister\\'s office and seized legal papers from her safe in a major national security case, the High Court has heard.\\nThe case centres on claims of complicity by UK intelligence services in torture by the CIA of alleged al-Qaeda operative Abu Faraj al-Libi, who is held at Guantanamo Bay.\\nDuring a hearing in London, his barrister Jesse Nicholls said government security officers had conducted an \"unlawful entry, search, sift and seizure\" of documents.\\nMr Justice Chamberlain directed that \"all the material\" taken from the barrister\\'s safe be returned to her.\\nHe ordered a further hearing on 25 March, which will consider whether the government\\'s actions were unlawful.\\nThe affected barrister is Rachel Toney, who represents al-Libi\\'s interests in secret hearings which are closed to him and his own lawyers.\\nLike many cases involving MI5 and MI6, this one takes place partly in secret to allow the government to use evidence it deems too sensitive to disclose publicly, or to al-Libi and his lawyers.\\nAccess to the closed part of the case is available only to the judge, government, and security-cleared barristers known as special advocates who represent al-Libi. Toney is a special advocate in this case and in many others.\\nThe special advocates are separate from al-Libi\\'s own solicitors and barristers, who can only communicate with the special advocates using messages sent via an official go-between - a civil servant - to check that nothing secret is disclosed.\\nGovernment security officers entered Toney\\'s chambers last month.\\nIn written submissions, al-Libi\\'s barristers said the government had \"proceeded to enter her chambers despite having been refused permission, enter her safe in her absence, and remove the very working material over which consent had been expressly refused, in both electronic and paper form\".\\nIn the absence of judicial authority for the search, they argued the move was \"obviously unlawful\".\\nThey said the government team had sifted through legally privileged material and accessed her laptop before proceeding to delete multiple files.\\nThe government seized and deleted documents relating to another case that Toney worked on - that of a Palestinian man called Abu-Zubaydah - who was tortured by the CIA.\\nThe BBC revealed in January that the UK government had paid him a \"substantial\" sum of compensation to settle a case in which he said MI5 and MI6 were complicit in his torture.\\nAl-Libi\\'s barristers said the government\\'s knowledge of CIA torture programmes is key to his case, and that Toney\\'s existing awareness of this subject means she is at \"at least as familiar\" with the relevant material as the government\\'s own lawyers.\\nThey argued the seizure was therefore \"heavily aggravated by the circumstances and appears to have had a doubtful or improper motive\". They said this motive was to \"gain a litigation advantage\" at a time when Toney was being effective and therefore proving \"troublesome\" for the government.\\nThey asked whether Attorney General Lord Hermer was aware in advance and had given his consent.\\nIn a legal note by Toney and her fellow special advocate, they said that her access to the Abu Zubaydah material has \"unsurprisingly\" been important given the similarities between his case and the al-Libi one.\\nThey said the government\\'s actions were \"unprecedented\" and that the \"inescapable conclusion is that Miss Toney has been singled out\".\\n\"We are concerned that the motivation is to achieve an advantage in the litigation, and whether that is in fact the motivation, that is its clear effect\", they added.\\nThey said, such is their \"disquiet\" at what has occurred, that they are \"considering resigning from this case\".\\nIn a letter to al-Libi\\'s lawyers, seen by the BBC, the government said the intelligence services had not consented to the use of material disclosed in the Abu Zubaydah case, and that their position is that Toney is not entitled to use that material.\\nDuring the hearing, Rory Phillips KC, representing the government, said the search and seizure was carried out by an independent legal section of the government that deals with special advocates. The judge put it to him that the person who went to Toney\\'s chambers is \"your agent\", but he denied this.\\nAt the end of the hearing, following a closed session to which the BBC did not have access, Mr Justice Chamberlain said Toney is permitted to use the material to prepare for a hearing in the case later this month. He said this direction was with the consent of the government, which also now consented to giving her the documents back.\\nAl-Libi, a Libyan national, has been imprisoned without trial at Guantanamo Bay since 2006. He was captured by Pakistani special forces in May 2005 and transferred to US custody within days.\\nAl-Libi alleges that he suffered torture and extreme mistreatment while held at secret CIA prisons known as \\'black sites\\' in various countries, whilst MI5 and MI6 passed questions for use during his interrogations.\\nUS authorities say he was a senior al-Qaeda figure and had long-term associations with Osama Bin Laden.\\nIf you have information about this story or a similar one that you would like to share with Daniel De Simone and the BBC News Investigations team please get in touch.

They are basically just giving you a gun to go and die,\" he added.\\nThose undergoing explosives and weapons training are only required to attend training for nine days before being sent to the front line, the report said.\\nIchung\\'wah said that, initially, recruits departed through Nairobi\\'s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) using tourist visas and travelled through Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\\nHowever, with heightened surveillance at JKIA, traffickers reportedly changed tactics, rerouting victims through South Africa, Uganda and other neighbouring states.\\nThe report identified some of the rogue agencies behind the recruitment of Kenyans and the medical facilities used for testing.\\nAuthorities say several suspects, including the alleged mastermind, remain under active investigation, with further arrests expected. Investigations continue as officials seek additional suspects and work to rescue Kenyans still caught in the conflict.\\nSpeaking to the BBC last week, Kenya\\'s Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said Nairobi had shut down more than 600 recruitment agencies suspected of duping Kenyans with promises of jobs overseas.\\nMudavadi said Kenya was working closely with Russia on curbing illegal recruitment practices, including discussions on visa policy and bilateral labour agreements excluding military conscription.\\nThe foreigner minister is due to visit Moscow next month to discuss the matter.\\nSo far 27 Kenyans who had been fighting in Russia have been repatriated, he said, with authorities providing psychological care to address their trauma and \"de-radicalise\" them.\\nPressure has been mounting on the Kenyan government to act after the recent discovery of more bodies of nationals of African countries who had been recruited to fight for Russian armed forces.\\nLast November, Ukraine\\'s foreign minister said that more than 1,400 people from 36 countries in Africa had been recruited to fight for Russia.\\nUkraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.\\nUkrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.\\n\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'A UN fact-finding mission has determined that evidence of atrocities carried out during the siege and takeover of the Sudanese city of el-Fasher points to genocide.\\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) captured el-Fasher, located in the western region of Darfur, at the end of October after an 18-month blockade.\\nIt was one of the most brutal chapters in Sudan\\'s nearly three-year civil war and triggered widespread international outrage.\\nThis is the closest the UN has come to declaring that genocide is being carried out by RSF fighters in Darfur during the current conflict. The RSF has not commented on the report but has denied previous such accusations.\\n\"The body of evidence we collected — including the prolonged siege, starvation and denial of humanitarian assistance, followed by mass killings, rape, torture and enforced disappearance, systematic humiliation and perpetrators\\' own declarations - leaves only one reasonable inference,\" said fact-finding mission expert Mona Rishmawi. \"The RSF acted with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Zaghawa and Fur communities in El-Fasher. These are the hallmarks of genocide.\"\\nThe report concludes that at least three underlying acts of genocide were committed, including killing members of a protected ethnic group; causing serious bodily and mental harm; and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group\\'s physical destruction in whole or in part.\\nThe investigators were not able to visit el-Fasher but based their report on more than 320 interviews with survivors, statements from RSF commanders and verified videos and satellite images.\\nCalling the findings \"truly horrific\", UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she would take the report\\'s conclusions to the UN Security Council on Thursday.\\nIn a statement she said there must be international criminal investigations to ensure accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims, and an end to the arms flow feeding the conflict.\\nSudan\\'s civil war erupted in April 2023 out of a power struggle between the regular army and the RSF over how and whether the paramilitaries would integrate into the security forces. It evolved into a country-wide conflict fuelled by longstanding local grievances and ethnic divisions.\\nBoth sides have been accused of committing human rights abuses and war crimes.\\nIn the Darfur region, Arab militias that form the backbone of the RSF have targeted non-Arabs they see as enemies, using savage tactics also employed some 20 years ago. At that time, they massacred hundreds of thousands of Darfuris from indigenous African ethnic groups, employed by the country\\'s then authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir to put down local rebellions.\\nThe report says the city was deliberately starved and destroyed during the long siege, which systematically weakened the \"targeted population\" and left them defenceless against the extreme violence that followed.\\n\"Thousands of persons, particularly the Zaghawa, were killed, raped or disappeared during three days of absolute horror,\" it says, as RSF troops failed to distinguish between Zaghawa civilians and the armed groups defending the city.\\nInvestigators described RSF conduct in el-Fasher as an aggravation of earlier patterns but on a far more lethal scale, noting that this demonstrates the failure to prevent the atrocities despite clear warning signs. They say without prevention and accountability, the risk of \"more genocidal acts remains serious and ongoing\".\\nThe mandate issued by the Human Rights Council in Geneva called on the investigative team to \"identify, where possible\" suspected perpetrators in a bid to ensure they are \"held accountable\".\\nThe report names RSF Leader Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (widely known as Hemedti) and spokesperson Lt Col Al-Fatih Al-Qurashi, citing the way they publicly claimed and celebrated the operation.\\nIt notes that General Hemedti acknowledged some \"violations\" had occurred during the takeover of the city but that while he described el-Fasher as a \"catastrophe\", he justified the assault as necessary.\\nThe RSF leader also issued instructions for his fighters not to harm civilians or kill prisoners, and he promised investigations. But investigators say the RSF did not respond to the mission\\'s request to clarify the steps it had taken, or any other questions.\\n\"The scale, coordination, and public endorsement of the operation by the senior Rapid Support Forces leadership point to a planned and organised operation executed through an established hierarchy and structure, rather than isolated acts,\" the UN mission said.\\nThe report names one one notorious commander known as \"Abu Lulu\" who was arrested after viral footage of his brutality surfaced, but said the RSF had provided no information regarding any judicial proceedings.\\nIt also says that despite their best efforts, the UN mission did not receive cooperation from Sudanese authorities. Yvette Cooper called obstructions \"from both warring parties... shameful and unacceptable\".\\nThe mission\\'s mandate did not include an investigation into the role of external actors who may be supporting the RSF.\\nBut crucially the report notes that the RSF\\'s military campaign was reinforced by foreign mercenaries equipped with \"advanced weaponry and communications systems\".\\nIt says investigators are engaging with several states regarding \"credible information\" that they are involved and will report on this matter in the future.\\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) is widely reported to be the main backer of the RSF, although it continues to forcefully deny this, despite extensive evidence from international investigations that the UN has previously described as credible.\\nAbu Dhabi\\'s role came under increased scrutiny after the el-Fasher massacre, but there was no public pressure on the UAE from the UN, the US or the UK.\\nThe Emirati foreign ministry condemned \"in the strongest terms the grave violations\" documented by the investigators but also condemned what it said were atrocities committed by the Sudanese armed forces.\\nIt underlined that the fact-finding report made no mention of Abu Dhabi and said it provided no support for the \"baseless claims associating the UAE with violations of international law in Sudan\".\\nThe investigators called on the international community to fully enforce the existing arms embargo on Darfur and expand it to the rest of the country; to prevent the transfer of weapons and other support to parties implicated in serious violations; to ensure accountability through targeted sanctions; to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Court; and to consider the establishment of a judicial mechanism working in tandem with it.\\nCooper said it was important that the fact-finding mission planned to conduct further investigations into reported breaches of the arms embargo and agreed that it should be extended and enforced.\\nShe said she planned to highlight the systematic and widespread sexual violence which she calls \"a war against women\\'s bodies\".\\n\"Most important of all we need global action and pressure in pursuit of a ceasefire, and essential humanitarian access with support for survivors,\" she said.\\nThe UN Security Council session is aimed at pushing for progress on a humanitarian truce, which has been elusive despite the enormous civilian suffering. The warring parties both frame the conflict as an existential battle and are able to continue fighting with increasingly sophisticated weapons supplied by their foreign backers.\\n\"The world is still failing the people of Sudan,\" Cooper said. \"When the stories started to emerge about the horrors of el-Fasher it should have been a turning point, but the violence is continuing. Today, in the Security Council, the UK as President will make sure the world does not look away.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'If you ate a corn on the cob, green beans or some spring onions in the UK this winter, chances are it would have come from one of two farms at the edge of the Sahara, in the north of Senegal.\\nThe West African nation is becoming an important player in the UK\\'s food supply. Is that a good thing?\\nHidden behind green leaves and thick stalks you can hear Diarra at work before you see her.\\nThe cobs of corn she\\'s harvesting are so abundant and the plants so tall, she\\'s almost lost in a sea of maize. And the job at hand is tough.\\nThis far north in Senegal, so close to the desert, temperatures can exceed 35C at this time of the year, and there\\'s little or no rainfall.\\nWorking at speed and with sunhats on, Diarra and her team of pickers make a steady sound of rustling, followed by a thud-thud, as they strip the cobs off each plant and place them in soft buckets strapped to their backs.\\nWithin an hour, the cobs will be inside a refrigerated pack-house and chilled down to 0C. Soon after, they\\'ll be driven by truck to a port near the capital, Dakar, and loaded onto a container ship. Six days later, they\\'ll be on sale inside a British supermarket.\\nDiarra is one of 9,000 employees, mostly women, working on two British-run farms in Senegal\\'s Saint-Louis region.\\nBetween January and March, if you browse the fresh produce aisles of the UK\\'s biggest food retailers, including Tesco, Sainsbury\\'s, Asda, Aldi and Lidl, you\\'re likely to see spring onions, radishes, green beans, chillis, butternut squash, and cobs of corn, all labelled Produce of Senegal.\\nThe hot climate and sandy, parched soil make this an unlikely place for fruit and vegetables – or so you might think.\\nAnd yet, it\\'s from here, at the edge of the desert, two of the UK\\'s biggest fresh produce businesses - G\\'s Fresh and Barfoots - are growing an increasing amount of food.\\nThe origins of the farms go back to the early 2000s. Back then, French entrepreneur and agronomist Michael Laurent began using Google Earth to identify new locations for food production.\\nSaint-Louis, he realised, has an abundance of sunlight, land and labour. And, although there is little rainfall, the 1,600km (1,000-mile) long Senegal River forms its northern border with the neighbouring country of Mauritania, before emptying into the Atlantic.\\nSome of this river water is diverted into a maze of canals. A network of pumps and pipes then distributes the water across miles of arid land to irrigate the farms that have helped to green the desert.\\n\"There was nothing here when we started,\" says Laurent. \"It was all bush.\" Now the farms cover 2,000 hectares of the land, the equivalent of almost 3,000 football pitches.\\nOn 500 of these hectares, salad specialist, Cambridgeshire-based G\\'s Fresh, runs its Senegalese subsidiary, West African Farms.\\nEach week, during the British winter, it supplies two million bunches of spring onions, 100 tonnes of green beans and 80 tonnes of radishes. Some 70% is sold to UK supermarkets, the rest goes to retailers in Germany and the Netherlands.\\nThe larger farm is a joint venture between Sussex-based Barfoots and SCL, the business founded by Michael Laurent.\\nThis supplies the UK with 55 million cobs of corn each year, along with chillis, butternut squash, and also green beans.\\nThe harvested vegetables go by road to the deep-water Port of Dakar five hours away by road. From there, one day a week, a large container ship departs on the 3,000-mile journey to Poole in Dorset.\\nThe UK imports around 40% of its food, but for fresh produce during the winter the proportion of imports can be as high as 90%.\\nUntil recently, the bulk of the UK\\'s imports of fruit and vegetables came from southern Europe and Latin American countries such as Peru, while airfreighted produce, including green beans, came from East Africa.\\nWest Africa is like the new kid on the block. Several factors are driving this, says Mike Knowles, an analyst specialising in fresh produce.\\n\"Competition for land around the Mediterranean has become more intense, droughts in Spain have become more frequent, and flying vegetables across continents has fallen out of favour,\" he explains.\\nAlso, as Brexit took away some of the advantages of importing food from continental Europe, Senegal became increasingly more appealing.\\nPolitically and economically, the country is relatively stable. It\\'s the only nation in West Africa which hasn\\'t experienced a military coup or seen its government overthrown.\\nOverseas businesses aren\\'t allowed to buy land, but it is possible to arrange long-term leases through agreements with the government and communities. Access to water is bought under licence though local management committees.\\n\"We\\'ve been confident enough to invest around £70m in our Senegalese operation,\" says Julian Marks, group manager of Barfoot\\'s.\\nAnd there\\'s constant pressure for them to expand. \"British consumers expect to be able to buy the same types of produce all year round,\" he says.\\nSenegal helps fulfil this demand, but what\\'s in it for the African nation?\\nThe 9,000 jobs created so far across the two farms is significant. Unemployment among Senegal\\'s 18 million population grew during the pandemic and has remained high, hovering around 19%, with young adults in rural areas most affected.\\nSenegalese land rights activist Elhadj \"Ardo\" Samba Sow used to see the arrival of the foreign-owned farms as a form of neo-colonialism. Now working in local politics, he\\'s more positive about their presence, \"even if the jobs aren\\'t so well paid\".\\nThe majority of the workers employed on the farms are guaranteed the minimum wage for agricultural workers in Senegal of around 2,500 West African francs a day ($4.50; £3). Pickers such as Diarra receive bonus payments if they\\'re fast and exceed daily targets.\\nWhile Senegal has recently seen a rise in its minimum wage, Micheal Laurent acknowledges that wages are \"not a lot\", but that \"profit margins are very low, and we need to remain competitive\".\\nThe low wages are another reason why the farms in Senegal could see further expansion.\\n\"When we grow spring onions in the UK, 60% of the cost is labour,\" says Derek Wilkinson, managing director at G\\'s Fresh. \"In Senegal, labour counts for less than one third.\"\\nEven factoring in the cost of transportation from West Africa, on current trends Wilkinson believes it will soon make economic sense to replace more UK production with imports from Senegal, even during the British peak summer growing season. \"It\\'ll be down to the consumer to decide if they want to buy British or imported.\"\\nBut is it a good thing to ship vegetables all the way to the UK from Senegal. \"No,\" says Tim Lang, emeritus professor at City University, who first coined the term \"food miles\".\\nWhile transporting food by sea comes at a lower environmental cost than air freight, maritime shipping accounts for 3% of global greenhouse emissions.\\n\"We should align our diets with the seasons as much as possible,\" says Lang, \"And instead of imports from Africa, we need to be exploring the wider range of crops that can be grown in the UK.\"\\nAdditional reporting from Jack Thompson\\n'},\n",

But it has now come under fire from one of its key constituencies - South Africa\\'s mostly white farmers - many of whom vote for the centre-right DA or the right-wing Freedom Front Plus.\\nBut more damaging for Steenhuisen was the financial scandal that he became embroiled in - possibly the first time that this has happened to a DA leader.\\nSouth Africa\\'s Daily Maverick news site broke a story - that Steenhuisen had a default court judgment against him for unpaid personal credit card debt of almost 150,000 rand ($9,400; £6,700) - despite the fact that his annual salary was 2.69m rand ($168,000).\\nIn response, Steenhuisen said: \"My personal finances have nothing to do with the Daily Maverick unless you can demonstrate that illegal funds or the proceeds of corruption or abuse of office or undue benefits have flowed into or out of my accounts.\"\\nBut the disclosure tarnished his reputation - and that of the party - as people questioned how a leader who could not manage his own finances could manage the nation\\'s finances.\\nThe scandal coincided with Steenhuisen getting Ramaphosa to sack Environment Minister Dion George, then the DA\\'s federal finance chair.\\nWhile no official reason was given, various reports pinned his removal to his stance against wildlife trafficking.\\nWildlife trafficking, particularly poaching, is a significant problem in South Africa and George was praised by conservation groups for his role in championing reforms in the conservation and environmental sector, particularly by calling for an end to captive lion breeding.\\nThe EMS Foundation, which advocates for wildlife rights, said George\\'s removal was a \"political execution\" and accused Steenhuisen of walking \"straight into the arms of the wildlife-breeding sector\" when he assumed the agriculture portfolio.\\nThe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also raised concerns, particularly over the apparent close ties George\\'s successor Willie Aucamp had with wildlife breeders and hunters.\\nGeorge\\'s detractors within the DA pushed back against this narrative, citing under-performance and bullying allegations as reasons for his removal, while dismissing concerns about Aucamp\\'s appointment, saying it expects \"continued progress\" in conservation and anti-poaching efforts under his leadership.\\nThe DA also announced that it planned to institute a disciplinary inquiry into allegations that George \"unjustifiably\" raised the salaries of staff in his ministerial office - something that further tarnished the party\\'s reputation.\\nGeorge denied the allegations and said he was the victim of a \"smear campaign\" aimed at covering up the actual reasons for his firing.\\nHe then resigned from the party, but not before revealing that he had confiscated Steenhuisen\\'s DA-issued credit card last year because \"the account could not be reconciled\", with spending on UberEats, car rentals and hotel accommodation.\\nSteenhuisen denied the allegations, and a DA inquiry cleared him of any wrongdoing.\\nIt found that expenditure on the card had been \"fully reconciled\", and that the \"limited number of personal expenses had been adequately explained and reimbursed\".\\nBut possibly reading the political tea leaves, Steenhuisen later announced that he would step down as DA leader at its congress in April.\\nHe appeared upbeat as he addressed the media, looking nothing like a man being forced out, as he reflected on his political career and achievements.\\nSteenhuisen\\'s first foray into politics came in 1999 when he was appointed a councillor in his home city of Durban, before rising to become party leader 20 years later.\\nHis ascent had not been without scandal. In 2010 he was forced to resign as the DA leader for the KwaZulu-Natal region after it emerged that the married Steenhuisen was having an affair with a colleague\\'s wife.\\nSteenhuisen managed to quickly bounce back from that and found his way to parliament just a year later.\\nIn 2014, he became the DA\\'s chief whip, working closely with the party\\'s first black leader, Mmusi Maimane. The two formed a close bond that soured when Maimane resigned from the role in 2019. Steenhuisen replaced him.\\nSince then, the pair has often traded insults.\\nPolitical analyst Sandile Swana told the BBC that Steenhuisen should have never been the DA leader.\\nSwana mentioned his 2010 affair, public fallout with George and his alleged difficulties in managing his finances as examples of his poor leadership.\\nPolitical analyst Khanyi Magubane offered a different perspective, saying South Africans in general may view him as someone who was able to rise above party politics, but in the DA \"he will go down as a betrayer to many who wanted him to continue the position of a hardliner\" in the coalition government.\\nElaborating on this, she said that Steenhuisen\\'s good relationship with the ANC in government was the \"core issue\" that led him to announce that he would step down.\\nMagubane said that when Steenhuisen and his party joined the coalition government, \"there was almost an expectation that he would continue with the mandate of fighting for DA policies\".\\n\"But the exact opposite started to happen,\" Magubane said.\\nThis echoed George\\'s sentiments in his resignation from the party; the aggrieved veteran accused the DA, through Steenhuisen, of being \"captured\" by the ANC.\\nThe election result forced the DA and ANC, considered long-standing arch-rivals, to put aside their differences and work together.\\nThe pro-business DA had been a fierce critic of the ANC on many issues, including foreign policy - where the ANC is seen to be too close to countries such as Russia - and domestic policy, where it champions affirmative action.\\nDespite numerous hurdles along the way, including the DA\\'s refusal to support the government\\'s proposed budget twice last year, both parties have so far managed to make the best of the uneasy union.\\nThis was best exemplified when Steenhuisen backed Ramaphosa when the president was ambushed by US President Donald Trump at the Oval Office in May last year.\\nAfter Trump confronted the delegation with a video in support of discredited claims of a white genocide in South Africa, it was Steenhuisen who assured the US president that most white farmers wanted to stay in the country.\\nCape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis has been viewed as a favourite to replace Steenhuisen at the party\\'s elective conference, though local media is reporting that he could be challenged by the DA leader in the economic heartland of Gauteng, Solly Msimanga.\\nAnalyst Magubane doubts Msimanga stands a chance of winning.\\n\"As the Gauteng leader he has a lot of support, but Hill-Lewis still has the backing of senior party members like Helen Zille.\"\\nShe also reflected that, following Maimane\\'s stint in the post, she does not think the \"DA has the appetite for a black leader at the moment\".\\nThe DA has long been perceived as a party that promotes the interests of whites, Indians, and coloureds, as people of mixed race are known in South Africa.\\nMaimane stepped into the leadership post in 2015 as the DA was trying to broaden its appeal.\\nFour years later he quit after the party\\'s vote declined by about 1.5 percentage points in the general election.\\nExplaining his exit at the time, Maimane said the DA was \"not the vehicle best suited to take forward the vision of building\" a united South Africa.\\nBreaking up the party\\'s now white-dominated leadership will be hard, says Magubane, reflecting that the party needs \"to appease the conservative right made up of Afrikaners\".\\n\"A black leader will not be supported by the conservatives in the party.\"\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'For as long as many residents of Nairobi can remember, the Kenyan capital has been awash with red every 14 February.\\nOn Valentine\\'s Day, people are dressed in red, the colour of love and romance, or are carrying red roses.\\nTraders are quick to cash in, selling fresh blooms from local farms, as Kenya is one of the world\\'s top producers of cut flowers.\\nRecently though, instead of the soft red petals, some people have been opting for the brown, blue or purple of crisp banknotes, folded, rolled or fastened together into floral-like bouquets.\\nThe trend has spread to other African countries and has become so pervasive that it has drawn the concern of central banks in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Botswana and Namibia.\\nThey have all issued public warnings against damaging or defacing banknotes when making these bouquets of cash.\\nThe Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) says that in many instances, banknotes are \"glued, taped, stapled, pinned or otherwise affixed\".\\nDamaged notes can then be rejected by automated teller machines (ATMs) and cash‑sorting equipment, meaning they have to be withdrawn from circulation, at a cost to the taxpayer.\\nIn its notice, the CBK said it was not opposed to the use of cash gifts - only to practices that damaged notes - an offence that could lead to creators of money bouquets being jailed for up to seven years.\\nCash bouquets have been popularised by celebrities and online influencers, who often share videos of themselves presenting such gifts.\\nThe celebrations are not limited to Valentine\\'s Day - they extend to birthdays and other special occasions, meaning money bouquets are in demand throughout the year.\\nThe bouquets come in various designs, with creators arranging the banknotes to suit the taste and budget of each customer.\\nThe wads of cash used in such bouquets vary widely - they can amount to as little as 1,000 shillings ($8; £6) or as much as a million shillings, says Angela Muthoni, a florist at the Gift and Flowers shop in central Nairobi.\\nWhile many are created in floral designs, or a mix of flowers and money with elegant wrappings, they can also be part of cake designs or be given in gift boxes.\\nMuthoni says money bouquets have become popular in the last two years. In the run-up to Valentine\\'s Day, she has been receiving orders of between 15 and 20 bouquets every day, despite the CBK\\'s warning.\\n\"Everyone loves money,\" she tells the BBC, adding that gifting people cash takes away the stress of choosing a present.\\nSome Kenyans, however, argue that it just shows that people are becoming more materialistic, seeking to buy love with money, rather than romance.\\n\"It\\'s some form of peer pressure,\" 24-year-old Haskell Austin tells the BBC.\\nHe prefers giving flowers, describing the idea of gifting money as \"materialistic\".\\nBut if cash must be given, he prefers a straightforward transfer instead of folding or decorating it into bouquets.\\nA woman who identifies herself only as Lynn is disappointed by the timing of the CBK\\'s caution against making cash bouquets, coming just ahead of Valentine\\'s Day, as she was looking forward to receiving one.\\n\"People are still excited about the trend,\" she tells the BBC at Koinange Street, a popular spot for buying flowers in Nairobi.\\n\"I would prefer cash,\" Nicole Rono tells the BBC. \"Who doesn\\'t love money? Flowers are OK, yes, but now with what the CBK has said, you can still give cash without damaging it,\" she says.\\nFor university student Benjamin Nambwaya, the fact that women are usually the recipients is based on social expectations.\\nHe tells the BBC that the culture of giving money bouquets is a \"bad thing\" and can end up \"destroying relationships\", especially when it creates an expectation even when one cannot afford to give money.\\nHe would prefer to give flowers.\\n\"I think flowers are cool, because this is a small celebration or something just to show how how much you really adore this person,\" he says.\\nEconomic expert Odhiambo Ramogi says it is all about \"our capitalistic approach to life\".\\n\"Capitalistic societies are driven by advertising, by marketing and special days like Valentine\\'s are a very good opportunity.\"\\nFor Muthoni, the florist, it comes down to how someone wants to express their love.\\n\"Love people the way they want to be loved,\" she says, although she concedes that ultimately money is at the heart of it.\\n\"You can buy a lot of things with money. You might not know what someone likes, but money is the solution.\"\\nDiscussions about money bouquets have been widespread on social media since the CBK\\'s warning, drawing both praise and derision.\\nIt has sparked some humour as well, such as memes of bouquets made from rolled chapati bread.\\nSpeaking about the trend on TikTok, Kenyan Scott Ian Obaro said it may also have encouraged a culture of \"showing off\".\\nRamogi argues that the idea of giving flowers is largely a foreign concept in Africa, which he says helps explain why the culture of gifting money is more readily embraced.\\n\"The African hardly gave flowers,\" he says, adding that the practice is a Western tradition and that many Kenyans would prefer money \"to take care of a need\" rather than a flower given purely for sentimental reasons.\\n\"But now it\\'s combined with the fact that we are more materialistic. The natural flower has been replaced with the currency flower,\" he says.\\nThe intervention by Kenya\\'s regulator, along with those in other countries, may slow the culture of giving money bouquets.\\nMuthoni fears the move could lead to a loss of income for people who have built livelihoods around the bouquets, though she believes there is room for innovation.\\nShe says she has designed bouquets with transparent pockets that can hold money without it getting damaged and is considering other ideas such as digital bouquets.\\nSome have switched to using US dollars, which would not be affected by the warning from Kenya\\'s central bank.\\nSo the money bouquet culture is unlikely to be nipped in the bud any time soon.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Fears that South Sudan - the world\\'s youngest nation - could plunge into a full-blown civil war have intensified as fighting continues in Jonglei state, north-east of the capital, Juba.\\nGovernment forces are trying to retake territory from those loyal to First Vice-President Riek Machar, who has been suspended from his post after being accused of plotting to overthrow President Salva Kiir.\\nMachar is currently on trial in Juba, on charges of murder, treason and crimes against humanity, which he denies.\\nHis party, the Sudan People\\'s Liberation Movement/Army In Opposition (SPLM/A-IO), has denounced the charges as a \"political witch-hunt\", and a move to \"dismantle\" a 2018 peace accord that ended a five-year civil war.\\nThe SPLM/A-IO and allied groups have said they have been capturing territory, including military bases, in Jonglei and other states since the end of last year.\\nSouth Sudan\\'s army responded with a counter offensive launched last month.\\nIn a controversial statement, deputy army chief Gen Johnson Oluny urged his troops to \"spare no-one\" including \"children, the elderly, and civilians\" when they were deployed to Jonglei.\\nThe government has clarified that this was not an order, saying it is committed to protecting civilians.\\nThe recent fighting in Jonglei has forced at least 280,000 people to flee their homes.\\nFacilities run by aid agencies, including clinics, have been looted and staff beaten up, according to the charity Oxfam.\\nSouth Sudan, one of the world\\'s poorest countries, gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of fighting led by the Sudan People\\'s Liberation Movement (SPLM).\\nJust two years into independence, a civil war erupted when Kiir dismissed Machar as vice-president, accusing him of plotting a coup.\\nThe ensuing conflict, largely fought along ethnic lines between supporters of the two leaders, resulted in an estimated 400,000 deaths and 2.5 million people being forced from their homes - more than a fifth of the population.\\nAs part of the peace deal, Machar was reinstated as vice-president within a unity government that was meant to pave the way for elections.\\nWhile the current conflict in Jonglei is driven primarily by national political rivalries, the state has long been a hotspot for inter-communal violence, particularly between sub-clans of the Dinka and Nuer.\\nCycles of violence linked to cattle raiding, land access, political representation and revenge attacks continue to shape and complicate the current conflict.\\nThe SPLM/A-IO draws much of its core support from Nuer communities, while the government and its allied forces are dominated by Dinka leadership. As a result, national political confrontations often reignite unresolved local grievances, increasing the risk of communal violence.\\nThe current crisis was sparked in March last year when the White Army militia, which was allied to Machar during the civil war, clashed with the army in Upper Nile state and overran a military base in Nasir.\\nThen on 7 March a UN helicopter attempting to evacuate troops came under fire, leaving several dead, including a high-ranking army general.\\nNearly three weeks later, Machar and several of his associates were placed under house arrest. They were accused of trying to stir up a rebellion.\\n\"The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,\" Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, deputy leader of SPLM/A-IO, said at the time.\\nRather than defusing tensions, the government struck again, hitting Machar with a slew of charges - including treason, the ultimate crime against the state - in September.\\nDays later, his party ratcheted up the pressure, denouncing Kiir\\'s government as a \"dictatorship\" and demanding \"regime change\".\\nHelicopter pilot recounts flying under gunfire in daring rescue mission\\nWhile Machar\\'s inclusion in the unity government was a key part of the agreement, other parts of it have not been implemented.\\nThe key issue for many South Sudanese is the security arrangement.\\nThe deal outlined how former rebel forces and government soldiers would be brought together into a unified national army made up of 83,000 troops. The remainder were supposed to be disarmed and demobilised.\\nBut this has not happened and there are still lots of militias aligned to different political groups.\\nThe deal also outlined the establishment, with the help of the African Union, of a court meant to try the perpetrators of the violence. But this has not been created, in part because those holding some of the top positions in government are reluctant to set up something that could see them put on trial.\\nElections that were supposed to happen in 2022 have still not taken place and neither has a new constitution been drawn up.\\nAn attempt to revive the peace process by Kenyan mediators is being made.\\nUnder what is known as the Tumaini Initiative - tumaini is Swahili for \"hope\" - the plan is for talks to be held in Kenya aimed at laying the groundwork for credible elections.\\nWhile Kiir and Machar, both in their 70s, were part of the SPLM that fought for independence, long-standing tensions exist.\\nThese have been fuelled by ethnic divisions - Kiir is Dinka, while Machar is Nuer - and competing political ambitions.\\nWhen Kiir sacked Machar in 2013, triggering the civil war, Machar denounced him as a \"dictator\".\\nCreating further problems between the two are the repeated postponements of elections.\\nPolls have been delayed four times, leaving Machar unable to fulfil his presidential ambitions while perceptions grow that Kiir intends to be president-for-life.\\nBorn in 1953, the 72-year-old was the 27th son of the chief of Ayod and Leer and was brought up in the Presbyterian Church.\\nAs an undergraduate, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Khartoum and in 1984 earned a PhD in philosophy and strategic planning at the UK\\'s Bradford University.\\nHe switched sides on several occasions during the battle to secede from Sudan, as he sought to strengthen his position and that of his Nuer ethnic group.\\nHe became vice-president of South Sudan at independence in 2011. Machar was sacked in 2013 and then reinstated as part of a deal in 2016, but then fled as fighting resumed.\\nBorn in 1951, the 74-year-old devout Roman Catholic was the son of a cattle herder and the eighth of nine children.\\nAt 17, he joined the Anyanya, one of the rebel groups that was fighting for southern independence during the First Sudanese Civil War in 1967. Sixteen years later - in the Second Sudanese Civil War - he was one of the five founding members of the Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army/Movement.\\nThe former rebel commander, who specialised in military intelligence, was seen as a moderate within the SPLM and became its leader in 2005 after the death of John Garang in a helicopter crash\\nHe became president of South Sudan on independence and has remained in that position for 14 years as no elections have taken place.\\nLast year, Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, warned that the country was \"teetering on the brink of a return to full-scale civil war\", which would devastate the nation still dealing with the aftermath of the last conflict.\\nThere are concerns that a return to fighting could lead to \"proxy warfare in the region\", according to Daniel Akech, an analyst at the Crisis Group think-tank.\\nAny conflict would have two main consequences, he added. \"First, the two sides will stoke ethnic grievances... as they seek to mobilise supporters and ready them for combat. Secondly, a flare-up in South Sudan is likely to draw in the country\\'s neighbours.\"\\nThe leaders of the members of the regional grouping Igad - including Uganda - are supposed to be the guarantors of the 2018 deal.\\nSome Ugandan troops have been deployed to the country as part of what South Sudan\\'s government said was a long-standing agreement to support the army.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

And the South African knows the perfect people to help: her grandchildren, Nomali and Trevor and her former student Etienne.\\nIn an abandoned warehouse in Johannesburg, Prof Grace sets out her high-stakes plan - to break into museums and private collections and take back artefacts mostly plundered during colonial times.\\nNone of this is real - rather it is the narrative of Relooted, what its creators call an \"African-futurist heist game\", released on Tuesday.\\nBut it\\'s a heist story with a difference - there\\'s no big pay day at the end of the heist and the characters don\\'t have a criminal background.\\nThey are motivated not by money - but by ever-shifting goalposts.\\nThe latest amendment to the Transatlantic Returns Treaty means only artefacts on public display have to be returned - and Western museums are now busy wrapping up objects and putting them into storage.\\nSports scientist Nomali is the mastermind - and the character through which the game is played, helped by colleagues from across the continent.\\n\"Nomali reluctantly agrees to the first heist to prove how dangerous the whole thing is,\" the game\\'s narrative director Mohale Mashigo told the BBC.\\n\"She would do anything for her family - and she joins them as a way to protect them from themselves and the real danger that is involved in heists.\"\\nNomali is a parkour legend and uses those skills - running, jumping, climbing, and vaulting over obstacles - to retrieve 70 African sacred and cultural objects.\\nHer brother Trevor, a locksmith and security systems expert, helps her in and out of the buildings - with intel from The Inside Man, Etienne, who is Belgian-British.\\nNdedi, from Cameroon, uses her acrobatic skills for the most elaborate escapes, Cryptic is the hacker from Kenya and Congolese Fred is the getaway driver and gadget maker.\\nDuring the twists and turns of the game, other characters emerge.\\nRelooted is designed by the pan-African team of Nyamakop studio in South Africa.\\nIts 2018 Semblance debut was the first African-developed game to launch on a Nintendo console.\\nDesigners and voice actors in countries including Nigeria, Angola, Malawi, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya also worked on Relooted.\\nIt is the first of what its CEO Ben Myres hopes will be a line of \"African-inspired games for a global audience.\"\\nThe action game, which uses motion captures and animated cinematics, is designed for PCs and consoles - which means that it won\\'t attract many players in Africa, where most people play on smartphones because they are more affordable.\\nThe core target audience is the African diaspora.\\nSithe Ncube, the game\\'s project manager, believes it will have a much wider appeal.\\n\"Taking back cultural artefacts that were looted is actually something a lot of people hope for - and fantasise about,\" Ncube, who is from Zambia, told the BBC.\\nMyres came up with the idea for Relooted during a visit to London. His mother had gone to the British Museum, where she saw the Nereid Monument - an ancient tomb that had been dismantled and moved between 1842 and 1844 to the museum, brick by brick, from the south of Turkey.\\n\"She was incensed, just really struck by the audacity of stealing a building and flippantly said: \\'You should make this into a game\\',\" Myres told the BBC.\\nMyres used artefacts instead of buildings because \"I could never figure out how to make moving a building out of another building very fun.\"\\nIn a deliberate contrast to the violent way in which many African artefacts were taken, there\\'s no violence in Relooted.\\nPlayers instead rely on solving puzzles, outsmarting systems, overcoming obstacles, teamwork and athleticism.\\nAt the end of the game the players take the reclaimed artefacts to a real place, the Museum of Black Civilizations in Dakar, Senegal.\\n\"It\\'s sort of a staging point for where all the artefacts will eventually return to the people they were taken from,\" Myres says.\\nThe artefacts in Relooted are based on real objects taken mostly by foreigners during the late 19th and 20th Centuries.\\nThough the game also features more recent thefts - like the sacred vigango carved grave markers from Kenya and Tanzania. A massive demand from Western art dealers encouraged a \"theft-to-order\" in the 1980s and 1990s - as happened a decade later with Dogon art from Mali.\\nAlso up for grabs by Nomali and her crew is a 300,000-year-old skull found in what is now Zambia.\\nKabwe 1, or Broken Hill Man, is one of the most significant human fossils ever found - and has been in the Natural History Museum in London since 1921, when it was discovered.\\nThe Asante Gold Mask - which was looted when British troops destroyed the royal palace in Kumasi in 1874 - is now held by the Wallace Collection in London.\\nThe Ngwi Ndem or Bangwa Queen, was removed from Cameroon in 1899. The wooden sculpture was once part of the extensive collection of African artefacts belonging to cosmetics pioneer Helena Rubinstein.\\nThe 81cm (32 in)-tall statute was made into a pop culture icon in the 1930s by renowned artist Man Ray when he photographed it alongside a nude model.\\nTo the Lebang people of south-western Cameroon, the Ngwi Ndem is more than a piece of art. It is a sacred lefem figure that represents the ancestors, symbolises fertility, prosperity and protection and was used in ceremonies.\\nThere\\'s no sign that the Dapper Foundation in France - which bought it at a Sotheby\\'s auction in 1990 for $3.4m (£2.5m) - will return it as requested.\\nFormal demands for the return of some of Africa\\'s best-known artefacts - the Benin Bronzes - were made as early as the 1930s by the Nigerian kingdom\\'s then monarch, Oba Akenzua II.\\nHe managed to get back two coral bead crowns and a tunic but it was only in 2021 that any significant repatriation of artefacts by Western universities and museums began.\\nIt remains a trickle, however.\\nNyamakop co-founder Myres is very clear that Relooted is first and foremost a form of entertainment.\\nBut the South African also sees the game as a \"general awareness-raising attempt about African culture, African history, and sort of the scale of this cultural artefact looting that has happened\".\\nThe unique nature of games makes them an ideal vehicle, explains Ncube.\\n\"You must actively engage in games,\" she says.\\n\"A lot of interactions are optional, and if you want to just play a fun game you can,\" she adds.\\n\"But in order to achieve certain goals in a game, you always have to do and learn certain things.\"\\nIn Relooted, briefings about the artefacts are part of Nomali\\'s mission.\\nPlayers also have the option to spend time learning more about the objects, their symbolism and the communities they belong to in the Hideout Room - which is modelled on the real Northcliff Water Tower overlooking the city of Johannesburg.\\n\"I\\'m fairly certain that anyone who plays the game will come away with a new perspective,\" Ncube says.\\n\"Whether it\\'s about an unknown history, injustices that people are still waiting to be addressed or even the fact that people in Africa can make games that are at a global standard.\"\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Ifunanya Nwangene was asleep last Saturday morning in her ground-floor apartment in Nigeria\\'s capital city when she was awoken at around 08:00 by a searing pain on her wrist.\\n\"A snake came up on her bed and bit her,\" Ifunanya\\'s father Christopher Nwangene told the BBC\\'s Newsday programme.\\nHe was relating the events that led to his daughter\\'s tragic death, which has raised serious concerns about how hospitals deal with snakebites, and the availability of antivenom across Nigeria, which has the world\\'s third-highest incidence of snakebites.\\nIfunanya, a well-known soprano singer in Nigeria - finding fame a few years ago on the local version of the TV competition The Voice, knew she had to get antivenom at a hospital as soon as possible.\\nHer father said she also applied a tourniquet, tying a piece of rope tightly around her arm.\\nThis used to be the recommendation for snakebites to stop the venom spreading through the body - though this is no longer the advice as a tourniquet, which stops the flow of blood, can cause tissue damage and increase the risk of amputation.\\nInstead, snakebite victims are told to keep calm, immobilise an affected limb and seek emergency medical care immediately.\\nBut it is hard not to panic when one arrives at a hospital to find there is no antivenom, which happened to Ifunanya, meaning she had to go to another one.\\nThe 26-year-old singer phoned her father when she later got to Abuja\\'s Federal Medical Centre, Jabi - and he then called his brother, who lives in the capital, to go and check on her.\\nShe was not in a good way when her uncle got to the hospital - her tourniquet had been removed and she was put on a drip.\\n\"Immediately they gave her the drip, the little girl started going down immediately. She said: \\'Daddy, I cannot speak,\\'\" Nwangene recalled.\\nIfunanya\\'s close friend, Sam Ezugwu, had also rushed to the hospital when he heard the news and told the BBC that some antivenom had been given to her, but more was needed.\\n\"While they were trying to stabilise her, she could not speak but she could make hand gestures. She was struggling to breathe,\" said Ezugwu, who is music director of the Amemuso Choir where Ifunanya sang.\\nHe went out looking for another vial of antivenom - as did her uncle.\\nThis version of events has since been disputed by the Federal Medical Centre, Jabi, which has denied the antivenom was unavailable and said claims its response was inadequate were unfounded.\\nIn Nigeria what is known as a \"polyvalent antivenom\" is usually used to treat snakebites, which means it can be used for bites from a variety of snakes.\\nThe amount needed depends on the severity of the bite and the type of snake - with a vial currently costing between 45,000 naira ($33; £24) and 80,000 naira ($58; £43).\\n\"They asked my brother to go and buy antivenom from [a] pharmacy,\" Nwangene said, explaining that he had to go to several places.\\nBut when he found some, it was too late. Ezugwu also returned with a vial to find Ifunanya had died.\\nNwangene feels the hospital authorities did not do enough for his daughter - and questions why they removed the tourniquet if they did not have the medication to treat her.\\n\"They\\'re not supposed to remove that thing. She has two hands,\" he said, expressing the view that an amputation is better than death.\\n\"They were not serious initially, as my brother told me. They were not serious at all.\"\\nHer death has prompted widespread grief and urgent questions about the country\\'s readiness to tackle a persistent and lethal public health issue.\\nIt has also shocked a nation where snakebites are often perceived as a rural danger.\\nAnother of the singer\\'s friends told the BBC that two snakes were later found in her apartment in an upmarket area of Abuja.\\nVideos circulated online showing a snake handler removing one of the long black snakes that had slithered into the building - with onlookers screaming.\\nIt is seen raising its hood, revealing it to be a cobra - and its colouring suggests it was a forest cobra, which, according to the African Snakebite Institute, is one of 12 highly venomous species of snakes found in Nigeria.\\nIn 2021, Nigeria\\'s then-Health Minister, Olorunnimbe Mamora, stated that an average of 20,000 snakebites were recorded each year in the West African nation, describing the situation as having reached \"epidemic proportions\".\\nThe crisis is compounded by a critical shortage of affordable antivenom, which needs to be stored in fridges - often impossible in areas with unreliable electricity.\\nShuaibu Mohammed, who lives in the north-eastern state of Gombe, said he was lucky to survive a snakebite 15 years ago.\\nHe was at boarding school when he stepped on a cobra in the playground. He was rushed to hospital, which luckily had enough antivenom to treat him.\\nBut three years ago, the outcome for his sister Sadiya, a mother of two, was fatal.\\n\"It was in the night - and she came out to use the toilet when the snake bit her,\" he told the BBC.\\n\"We rushed her to the hospital but there was no antivenom,\" he told the BBC.\\n\"We were told we could buy some from the neighbouring state of Plateau. We called a brother there to get it, but before the antivenom was transported to us, we lost her,\" he said.\\nIt is a story Hafiz Aminu, from the northern state of Kaduna, knows all too well.\\n\"I almost lost my life last year,\" the 36-year-old told the BBC.\\n\"I was returning home after a football game when a cobra bit me. But when we got to the nearest hospital, we were told they didn\\'t have any antivenom.\\n\"So we quickly decided to seek traditional help from a healer.\"\\nThe herbalist gave him a concoction made from the bark of a plant - likely to have been that of the African custard apple, which is commonly used as a traditional medicine in Nigeria to treat snakebites.\\nA 2005 study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Ethnopharmacology showed the relative effectiveness of the rootbark of this plant in treating cobra venom on rats, stating that it helped reduce fevers and \"directly detoxified the snake venom used by 16-33%\".\\nAminu said the herbalist rubbed some of the mixture on his foot, where he had been bitten, and he was told to drink the rest with the warning that it would make him feel nauseous.\\n\"I was feeling very weak and was scared for my life. When the healer saw me two days later, he said I was lucky to be alive.\"\\nThe African Snakebite Institute warns that traditional remedies are not known to work against highly venomous snakes.\\nExperts point out that the widespread use of traditional healers for snakebites means that the true scale of the problem is not known, as many deaths will go unrecorded.\\nIn response to Ifunanya\\'s death, the Nigerian Senate has called on the health ministry and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac) to ensure the nationwide availability of safe, effective and affordable antivenoms.\\nHowever, the motion did not set a specific timeline for action.\\n\"A snakebite kills one person every five minutes,\" said Elhadj As Sy, chancellor of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) and co-chair of the Global Snakebite Taskforce.\\nHe called on governments to integrate snakebite treatments into core health strategies and ensure that antivenom was accessible.\\n\"With real political commitment we can end these preventable deaths,\" he told the BBC.\\nThere have also been breakthroughs that may one day lead to more affordable solutions.\\nScientists from LSTM and the University of Sydney announced in 2024 that the blood thinner heparin could be repurposed as an inexpensive antidote for cobra venom.\\nAt the time, University of Sydney\\'s Prof Greg Neely envisaged it had the potential to be used like an EpiPen, a device carried by people with allergies at risk of death from anaphylactic shock. It delivers a shot of adrenaline, while a snakebite pen could inject heparin.\\nFor Nwangene, medics on the frontline in Nigeria need more \"human sympathy\" when dealing with snakebite victims.\\nHe added that Ifunanya\\'s gifted voice had given him great happiness over the years.\\n\"My daughter is a very, very gentle girl. When she was growing up, she has been singing in our church - very, very, very talented.\\n\"Every morning when I wake up, I thank God on her for giving me such a child until this wicked world took her away from me.\"\\nAdditional reporting by Makuochi Okafor\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Although their forefathers were seized from West and Central Africa centuries ago, the bond between African-Americans and their ancestral home has been a lasting one.\\nFor instance, Liberia, Africa\\'s oldest republic, was founded by freed black American slaves in 1822. After Ghana became independent in 1957, a wave of black intellectuals and artists moved there from the US. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali subsequently paid high-profile visits to Ghana, while Guinea became home to Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael.\\nThis transatlantic connection has ebbed and flowed over time - but in recent years, there has been a real resurgence, helped by the use of DNA tests.\\nA number of black American celebrities have sought the nationality of African countries - singer Ciara has become a citizen of Benin, rapper Ludacris and film star Samuel L Jackson are officially Gabonese, actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors are citizens of Guinea and musical icon Stevie Wonder has Ghanaian papers.\\nJust last week, wildly popular content creator IShowSpeed was approved for a Ghanaian passport after stopping in the country on a whirlwind African tour.\\nThe celebs have, in most cases, flown out for elaborate citizenship ceremonies and tours of local beauty spots, all of which have been captured for glossy social media content.\\nPosting photos of her citizenship ceremony in Guinea, Meagan Good told her 7.8m Instagram followers last month: \"This is history in motion\".\\nGood, who has featured in films like Think Like A Man and Saw V, and her husband Majors, known for Creed and Marvel flick Ant-Man and the Wasp, became citizens after DNA testing traced their ancestry to Guinea.\\n\"This recognition goes beyond titles, it is a homecoming and a reconnection to our Afrodescendant roots,\" said Good.\\nMessaging from the various African governments has echoed this sentiment.\\n\"In conferring Ghanaian citizenship upon Stevie Wonder,\" former president Nana Akufo-Addo said at Wonder\\'s 2024 ceremony, \"we not only extend our warmest embrace to a beloved son of Africa but also reaffirm our belief in the enduring spirit of pan-Africanism and the global African family\".\\nGhana has long promoted its pan-African credentials - for a decade anyone whose ancestors came from Africa have been entitled to Ghanaian nationality, a policy that arguably inspired Benin to launch a similar scheme.\\nGhana also launched the \"year of return\" in 2019, a buzzy initiative encouraging Africans in the diaspora to relocate there.\\nMore than 1,000 African-Americans have done so in the past decade, according to Dr Erieka Bennet, ambassador for the Diaspora African Forum, which helps people relocate to Ghana.\\n\"It is not only about romanticism,\" Marie-Roger Biloa, a Cameroonian journalist with a focus on West Africa, tells the BBC.\\n\"It\\'s all very much about how can we tap into the potential they have, the Americans.\"\\nTourism is an obvious motivator. Governments hope that social media posts from the stars will encourage other black Americans, a large group with a growing economic power, to visit and inject money into their countries.\\nBiloa notes that Benin\\'s president, a former business tycoon, is keenly aware that his country\\'s former role as a key departure point for slaves makes it a poignant destination for black Americans.\\n\"President [Patrice] Talon has really started investing in cultural heritage, in a way to engage the African-Americans worldwide. He understood it could be an engine for a new form of tourism and a new branch of economy,\" she says, mentioning The Marina Project, a memorial and tourist complex being built in Ouidah, once one of Benin\\'s main slave ports.\\nPositive publicity from stars like Ciara may also encourage diasporans to invest or buy property in Benin, as they have been doing in Ghana since the year of return.\\nSoft power is also an important factor - by promoting their culture and building a robust network around the world, countries like Benin, Guinea, Gabon and Ghana stand to gain global influence.\\nIn this mission, celebrity citizens act as ambassadors, Francis Kpatindé, a Beninois lecturer at France\\'s Sciences Po University, tells the BBC.\\n\"Benin has no diamonds like the Democratic Republic of Congo, no petrol, nothing. We just have cotton, the ports and culture,\" he says.\\nThe celebrity ambassadors are \"a way for us to be on the record, to be on-screen. Now it\\'s working. You can go to the social networks. You see Benin everywhere,\" Kpatindé says.\\nMany people from the countries involved recognise the economic and political benefits of giving citizenship to black American celebrities, but others are more critical.\\nThere is an underlying feeling that the stars are bypassing what can be, for those born in the countries, a cumbersome and costly process to get passports.\\nTaufic Suleman, a painter and decorator from Ghana, felt \"irritated\" when the foreign minister announced that IShowSpeed, who grew up in the US but has a Ghanaian mother, had been approved for a passport.\\n\"It is really, really, really a bad precedent... why do people, your citizens, have to go through vetting? Sometimes others end up being denied,\" Suleman, aged 32, tells the BBC.\\n\"You just can\\'t hand out a passport to anyone just because the person is a celebrity.\"\\nFollowing the foreign minister\\'s announcement, Patrick Boamah, a member of the Ghanaian parliament\\'s Foreign Affairs Committee, told local broadcaster Channel One that IShowSpeed must follow the required legal procedures to get a passport, although the authorities \"may waive certain steps for him\".\\nSindé Chekete, the head of Benin\\'s tourism authority, told the BBC that \"citizenship processing is not influenced by celebrity status\" and that Ciara \"followed the same standard procedure as any other applicant\".\\nAnother criticism of the celebrity citizenship trend is that it will be superficial and fleeting - the stars will collect their certificates, publish a few social media posts, then go quiet.\\nIt is not clear whether, in all cases, the celebrities are required to publicise or maintain lasting links to their second homes, but Chekete stressed that Beninois citizenship \"is not a transaction and it does not come with contractual obligations, whether promotional, financial, or otherwise\".\\nSix months after getting her citizenship, Ciara returned to Benin in January to play at the Vodun Days festival.\\nMeanwhile, Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have stressed that their connection with Guinea would be \"long-term and evolving\".\\n\"We could absolutely see ourselves having a home here and spending meaningful time in Guinea,\" they told the BBC over email.\\nYaw Nyame, one of the numerous Ghanaians who welcomed IShowSpeed\\'s naturalisation, says he hopes the content creator uses his passport to set up a base in the country.\\n\"Even if he\\'s not going to come to Ghana all the time, at least him having his presence in Ghana or doing a project in Ghana,\" Nyame says.\\nThe doctor says giving IShowSpeed, real name Darren Watkins Jr, a passport is a \"brilliant, strategic move\" as the creator currently has \"all eyes on him\". He has more than 50 million YouTube subscribers, with a recent 20-country tour of Africa contributing to the growth of his platform.\\nIt will take time for Ghana, Gabon, Guinea and Benin to gauge whether their strategies have paid off - maybe one or two decades, Kpatindé says.\\nEarlier this week, Benin\\'s government said it would open a government agency specifically dedicated to nationalising \"Afro-descendants\".\\nHowever, Ghana reached a roadblock in its plans to reconnect with the diaspora, announcing it was pausing its citizenship applications as it needed to make the system more accessible and user-friendly.\\nRegardless, Kpatindé believes that by welcoming home some of the diaspora\\'s brightest stars, the African countries are on the right trajectory.\\nPeople on the continent have long hailed pan-Africanism, \"but now we need action,\" he says. \"We need concrete acts, not to just speak\".\\nAdditional reporting by Makuochi Okafor\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The peace of lush, rural landscape in South Africa\\'s KwaZulu-Natal province disguises the anxiety that is stalking the land.\\nThis is the epicentre of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak that has – in the past year – swept across eight of the country\\'s nine provinces, devastating animal herds, with many cattle being killed to halt its spread.\\nFarmers are fearful that they could lose their livelihoods altogether as other countries take action and stop the import of South African animal products.\\nThe highly contagious virus, passed through direct animal contact or in contaminated feed or water, causes painful blisters inside the mouth and under the hooves of animals such as goats, cows and sheep, and can lead to lameness and problems feeding. It lowers their yields and also sometimes kills young animals but is not harmful to humans.\\nThe current situation in South Africa has now been declared a national disaster. Despite being a relatively small part of the economy, agriculture is a key employer in rural areas and in normal times provides vital foreign exchange through meat and livestock exports.\\nKwaZulu-Natal is the heartland of the country\\'s dairy industry.\\nFarms, with their cows grazing on the grass, dot the green hills lining the Mooi River.\\nHere, biosecurity measures such as disinfection points at farm entrances designed to prevent the spread of the virus as well as roadblocks and restrictions on the movement of cattle, have not always worked.\\nThe herd at the large commercial farm run by Carol Houston and her husband became infected last month.\\n\"We received a call from our staff that 50 cows were showing signs of mastitis and were hobbling, struggling to walk. We did all we could to keep the disease out and spent roughly $380 (£280) per cow on treatment [including antibiotics],\" Houston tells the BBC.\\n\"My milking herd\\'s normal output dropped from 14,000 litres of milk per day to 9,000 within days of the outbreak because infected cows eat less and struggled to produce milk.\"\\nMilk production stayed at that level for about two weeks until the infection was cleared from her herd of 2,200 cattle.\\nNow, as the cows line up to be milked, workers check each one for symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease.\\nWith the afternoon sun beating down while the cows snort and moo, the workers inspect and clean the animals\\' teats, which are then attached to milking equipment. The machines gently suck out the milk and transfer it to large containers.\\nHouston, who has 35 years\\' farming experience, blames the government for failing to stop the spread of the virus – an opinion shared by many farmers, such as Peter Griffin, whose farm is in the same area.\\n\"The problem is it\\'s a catastrophe that could\\'ve been avoided,\" says the dejected dairy farmer who has been in the business for 44 years. \"We should never have got to this stage… the state has failed us.\"\\nIn South Africa, foot-and-mouth is classified as a \"controlled animal disease\", meaning that the government is responsible for taking the lead on measures to deal with it.\\nAgriculture Minister John Steenhuisen has faced a lot of criticism over the outbreak but last month he announced a long-term strategy to get rid of the disease within 10 years.\\nIn the short-term this includes mass vaccination in the worst-affected areas before extending it to the majority of the national herd, estimated to number around 14 million animals.\\nBut dairy farmer Houston is sceptical about how quickly this could happen.\\n\"We were told we would have the vaccine in January, we haven\\'t got the vaccine. We were told we would have the vaccine in February, we don\\'t have vaccine. So the ball gets pushed out, pushed out, pushed out. It\\'s very frustrating,\" she says.\\nAny delay could have big consequences for small-scale cattle farmers like Nompumelelo Ndlovu, who has about 20 animals and makes money from buying and selling them.\\n\"My biggest fear is if the vaccine doesn\\'t arrive on time, all my cattle will be at risk and that would be the end of my business,\" she says.\\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa\\'s designation of the outbreak as a national disaster allows the government to release extra funds and speed up the acquisition of vaccines from abroad.\\nFoot-and-mouth vaccines need to be imported as South Africa no longer has the capacity to produce them en masse. A lack of investment and a loss of technical expertise meant that the country\\'s ability to make agricultural vaccines ended more than two decades ago, according to Steenhuisen\\'s party, the Democratic Alliance.\\nThe agriculture minister has announced the restart of domestic production, though it will take some time before enough is produced to vaccinate most of the country\\'s entire herd as planned.\\nA million vaccines are due to arrive in South Africa from Argentina at the weekend, but they still have to be distributed and that is not enough to cover the whole country.\\n\"We are hoping that government will get this right in vaccinating the entire herd with speed,\" says Ntuthuko Shezi, head of investment company Livestock Wealth.\\n\"If we could get it right with Covid-19, we surely can with this outbreak.\"\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

We thank him for this,\" the Ethiopian prime minister added.\\nThis all comes against the backdrop of fears of a return to conflict in Ethiopia\\'s northern Tigray region, which borders Eritrea.\\nDuring the first Tigray war, which raged between 2020 and 2022, Eritrean forces fought alongside the Ethiopian army against local Tigrayan fighters.\\nBut allegiances have changed - and any renewed conflict in Tigray is likely to inflame tensions between the neighbours who fought a devastating border war between 1998 and 2000 that claimed more than 100,000 lives.\\nLocal media has been reporting about growing panic in cities in Tigray as alleged military build-ups continue near the region.\\nBanks in Tigray have run out of cash and civil servants did not receive their January salaries, further fuelling frustration.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

It says infection at birth is the most common way of having a lifelong infection, with 90% of infected newborns becoming chronic carriers.\\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the dose is currently given at six weeks, though authorities plan to introduce the birth dose nationwide by 2028 to align with global standards, something the WHO said it would help accelerate.\\nA total of 14,000 babies in the West African country were due to be involved in the study funded by the US and led by Danish researchers.\\nBut public outrage at the project prompted the Guinea-Bissau government to suspend it last month.\\nCritics have questioned why babies in the African country were being proposed for the trial.\\nTwo months ago, a panel of top advisers voted to stop recommending that all newborns in the US receive a hepatitis B vaccine.\\nThe panel was appointed by the US Health Secretary Kennedy, who had fired all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip) months earlier and replaced them with others critical of vaccines.\\nKennedy has on several occasions denied being against vaccinations and has said he and his children had been vaccinated, but has also repeatedly stated widely debunked claims about vaccine harms.\\nVocal opponents of the project in Guinea-Bissau include the country\\'s former health minister, Magda Robalo.\\n\"It\\'s not acceptable and it should not go on,\" she told the science journal Nature last month. \"Guinea-Bissauans are not guinea pigs.\"\\nMore than 12% of the country\\'s adult population has chronic Hepatitis B, according to the WHO.

These al-Shabab are useless, I want to assure that Kenya will work together with you, just help us combat these criminals and terrorists.\"\\nIn addition to the attack on the Westgate mall and Garissa University, other major al-Shabab attacks in Kenya include the killing of 28 bus passengers in Mandera county in 2014 and an assault on a hotel in Nairobi five years later which left at least 21 people dead.\\nIn 2015, Kenya had embarked on building a perimeter barrier along the countries\\' 680km (423-mile) common border because of the militant threat but the project was suspended after nearly three years when only 10km (six miles) of a wire fence had been built at a cost of $35m (£26m).\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

Some mockingly called it a \"blouse\", prompting a fierce response from Ghanaians online.\\nGhana\\'s Tourism Minister Abla Dzifa Gomashie said on Tuesday that wearing the outfit every week would help project the country\\'s identity \"with pride on the global stage\".\\nShe encouraged wearing the outfit \"in all its diverse forms, designs, and expressions, complemented by its distinctive and beautiful accessories\".\\nThe fugu, also known as batakari, is a traditional northern Ghanaian top made from hand‑woven, narrow strips of thick cotton fabric stitched together to form a structured, poncho‑style garment.\\nIt is worn by traditional leaders in northern Ghana, as well as ordinary citizens, and is a symbol of royalty and authority.\\nThe traditional fugu top is more often associated with men, who sometimes wear trousers and a hat in matching material, but women also wear a version of it, which can be styled longer or as a dress.\\nWhen Ghana became the first sub-Saharan nation to break free from colonial rule in 1957, its founding father - the pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah - and five others wore fugus at the celebrations that marked the country\\'s independence from the UK.\\nBeyond its cultural importance, Gomashie said the outfit\\'s weekly display would \"generate far-reaching social and economic benefits\" especially for local weavers, designers, artisans and traders.\\n\"The government hopes that this collective embrace of fugu will strengthen national unity, stimulate the creative economy, and serve as a powerful symbol of Ghana\\'s cultural confidence and self-expression,\" the minister added.\\nFollowing the announcement, many Ghanaians on Wednesday heeded the minister\\'s call, wearing the outfit in a variety of colours across the country.\\nBismark Owusu Sarpong told the BBC in the capital, Accra, that he was proud to wear his blue, white and black striped fugu, which he had received as a gift, to put \"Ghana on the map\" - plus he said the outfit came with the added bonus of being comfortable.\\nRaymond Avenor, also in Accra, agreed wholeheartedly with this: \\'\\'Fugu is an easy wear.\\n\"You pick it and off you go.

I feel good when I wear it.\"\\nFor Andrews Tetteh Zutah, who owns more than seven of the tops, \"Fugu Day\" should not only be restricted to Wednesdays.\\n\"I wish to have more,\" said the Accra office worker in his stripped red, khaki and black fugu.\\n\"I wish I will be allowed to wear it anytime to the office but because of office constraints I\\'m unable to wear it every day. Personally, it\\'s one of the outfits I love most.\"\\nThe attention has been great for fugu makers and sellers too.\\nElijah Sulemana Musah, owner of a fugu factory, says business is booming - adding that he has received lots of orders from Ghanaian celebrities such as popular musicians Okyeame Kwame and Kwabena Kwabena.\\n\\'\\'I\\'ve had calls coming in from several places both within and outside Ghana. I just met someone who said Zambians have called her and they are interested in the fugu and so she would wants me to supply to her,\" he told the BBC.\\nThe iconic outfit has been trending on social media for days following the banter between Ghanaians and Zambians.\\nThis revived a cultural movement on social media, with Ghanaians informally declaring \"Fugu Friday\" to showcase the outfits. Fridays had been designated by the previous government as a day where people were encouraged to wear traditional clothes.\\nThe debate prompted Ghanaians, including MPs, to flood social media proudly showcasing their fugus, while Zambians featured wearing their traditional outfits known as siziba.\\nThe online exchange attracted the attention of Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, who announced that his country would order fugus from Ghana.\\nPresident Mahama also suggested exporting the smock in bulk to Zambia.\\nWhile emphasising the fugu\\'s cultural and political significance, Mahama gave a nod to Nkrumah and how he had worn it in 1957 and said that he himself had recently worn it proudly to the UN.\\nOther presidents, including Nana Akufo-Addo, John Kufuor and Jerry John Rawlings, have also embraced and publicly promoted the outfit.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

Fela did a lot of work introducing the funk into the Yoruba music while comparatively I did almost the same thing in Ghana.\"\\nTowards the end of the last century and the beginning of this, Taylor spent more time teaching music at the University of Ghana and working on other people\\'s output, the New York Times reported.\\nBut he then returned to the studio and his new recordings began to attract attention well into later life, with albums such as Love & Death, Appia Kwa Bridge and Yen Ara reinforcing his standing as one of Ghana\\'s most important musical figures.\\nTaylor\\'s influence extended far beyond highlife.\\nIn recent decades, his work has been taken up by international audiences through sampling, with elements of his recordings appearing in songs by artists across hip-hop and R&B.\\nTracks including Heaven, Odofo Nyi Akyiri Biara and Love & Death have been sampled by performers including Usher, the Black Eyed Peas, Kelly Rowland, Jidenna, Vic Mensa and Rapsody, introducing his music to new listeners worldwide.\\nTalking about achieving wider recognition in his 70s he said: \"I think I\\'ve had my day, though it came much later.\"\\nIn his tribute, top Ghanaian music producer Panji Anoff remembered how everybody used to call him \"Uncle Ebo\" but he treated everyone as an equal.\\n\"He would sit with us, eat with us, drink and chill with us, some nearly 50 years his junior, as though we were all peers. He could relate with everybody, and if anybody ever needed a melody, Uncle Ebo would just plug in a guitar and show them the way,\" Anoff told the BBC.\\n\"We lost a legend whose contribution to music has created worldwide ripples. I take solace in the fact that I witnessed greatness in Uncle Ebo Taylor\\'s art form. Rest In Power!\" singer and rapper Black Sherif said.\\nReflecting on Taylor\\'s influence Shatta Wale said that \"his sound, vision and cultural impact opened doors for countless artists across Africa and beyond\".\\n\"He will be remembered as one of our greatest musicians ever... as a man who strove to put Ghanaian music on the global map at a time when other genres of music were prominent,\" presidential spokesperson Ofosu told the BBC\\'s Newsday programme.\\nAcross Ghana and the wider African diaspora, Taylor is recognised as a foundational figure whose work helped bridge traditional and modern sounds.\\nBy grounding innovation in cultural continuity, he left behind a body of music that continues to inform contemporary styles, including afrobeats, and remains central to the story of African popular music.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

It is just devastating,\" Mohammed Dauda, a local official, told the BBC.\\nAmnesty International said many of the dead had been found with their hands and feet tied - some had had their throats slit, others had been shot dead.\\nWhen the jihadists left in the morning, they took with them 38 women and children, including the rest of the traditional ruler\\'s family.\\n\"They killed two of my children and abducted my wife and three children,\" Salihu told me.\\nThe militants wanted residents to renounce the Nigerian government and its constitution and instead follow their teachings, effectively attempting to impose a parallel system of rule and government in the area.\\nThis was \"against what the Quran teaches\", Salihu said, referring to Islam\\'s holy book.\\nThe Nigerian government has blamed Boko Haram for the attack - the jihadist group has not issued any statement about it.\\nBoko Haram, which gained global attention in 2014 after abducting more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok, is still operating in the north-east of the country but has since splintered.\\nOne of its factions, Mahmuda, is now active in rural parts of Kwara and the neighbouring state of Niger.\\nAccording to Amnesty, the jihadists had been leafleting the two villages for the last five months.\\n\"These communities have been receiving these pamphlets, soliciting them to join the extremist views and preaching by these militants,\" Isa Sanusi, head of Amnesty International in Nigeria, told the BBC\\'s Newsday programme.\\n\"After they see a bit of resistance from the people, they then started sending them warnings,\" he added.\\nThis correlates with Usman\\'s account - that locals had received warnings days before the violence began.\\nLocal MP Saidu Baba Ahmed told the BBC the latest communication had been sent to Salihu, who had contacted the security forces about the letter.\\nThe military went to the area briefly to investigate, but after they left, the jihadists launched their assault, he said.\\nAmnesty says this shows a \"stunning security failure\".\\n\"We are wondering why this security lapse was allowed to happen, why the authorities could not take action,\" Sanusi said.\\nHe described how over many hours no-one went to the villagers\\' aid - and the militants were able to \"take their time\".\\n\"In fact, they even went to the mosque and prayed there.

When we came out, we saw the excavator.\"\\nShe says there was little time to move her family\\'s belongings.\\nHer son Solomon\\'s school in Makoko was demolished the same day.\\nSobie\\'s family moved briefly into a building nearby. That, too, was later pulled down.\\n\"We\\'re sleeping in an open space under the rain, and they\\'re currently setting properties ablaze,\" Sobie says, adding: \"We don\\'t have another place.\"\\nLike many other children, Solomon no longer goes to school. He now helps his mother gather firewood from collapsed houses, pulling loose planks from the debris to sell.\\nEven as the excavators work, canoe-borne business activities continue, with traders peddling their way through the remaining homes to sell fish and goods.\\nBut many other traders can no longer do business, as they lost their goods when their homes were demolished or torched.\\nWith the lagoon central to their lives, they have protested against the move to force them out of Makoko.\\nMore than 1,000 angry residents marched last week to the state legislature, the House of Assembly, demanding an audience with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, whose offices are nearby.\\nBut police responded by firing tear gas, with protesters saying that at least one person was injured in the ensuing chaos.\\nCommunity leaders and residents say that tear gas was also fired during the demolitions a few weeks ago, causing the death of five people, including children.\\n\"Children were weeping, some died, some were unconscious, and were taken to the hospital as a result of the tear gas,\" Sobie tells the BBC.\\nThe Lagos State government says it is unaware of their personnel using tear gas or of deaths linked to the demolitions.\\nSpeaking to the BBC, the state\\'s commissioner for information, Gbenga Omotoso, says that any such claims would be investigated.\\n\"We would determine the actual cause of death,\" he says. \"Our personnel will not knowingly kill anybody.\"\\nLagos lawmakers said that community leaders have been invited to a meeting on Tuesday to discuss their concerns.\\nThe state government has defended the demolitions, saying they are targeting homes built beneath high voltage power lines.\\n\"No responsible government anywhere in the world can allow people to live directly under high-tension cables or obstruct vital waterways,\" the governor\\'s special adviser on urban development, Olajide Abiodun Babatunde, said in a statement.\\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu said that affected families would be provided with financial grants and other assistance, and it was wrong to accuse him of \"destroying\" Makoko.\\nHe raised concern that shanties were \"sprawling\" at an \"incredible speed\", getting closer to the Third Mainland Bridge, the longest and busiest of three bridges connecting the mainland to the islands - the commercial heart of the city and its wealthier neighbourhoods.\\nFor the governor this spells danger.\\n\"There are high-tension power lines right underneath there. I am not going to sit down, and something will drop off, and in one day, over 100 to 500 people will die,\" he was quoted by local media as saying.\\n\"So, what we have done is that we just pushed them back,\" he added.\\nLagos-based real estate developer Peacemaker Afolabi tells the BBC that demand for land in the city is huge.\\n\"Everywhere in Lagos is prime land,\" he says. \"And waterfront is always prime.\"\\nSome residents suspect that the demolitions are aimed at clearing the area for private developments, including luxury homes.\\nThis has been repeatedly denied by the state government, but suspicion remains.\\nIn an article published in the US-based Atlanta Tribune, Nigerian journalist Emmanuel Abara Benson argues that Makoko stands as the \"most painful symbol\" of the gentrification of Lagos.\\n\"This is not the slow, decades-long gentrification often seen in Western cities. It\\'s a rapid, almost violent reshaping that is already forcing millions of residents to the margins,\" he writes.\\n\"In the next few years, Lagos may look more polished and globally appealing. But for many of its people, it will also become profoundly unliveable.\"\\nIn their joint statement, the NGOs said that demolitions in Makoko, and other settlements last year, were part of a \"sinister agenda to grab land\".\\n\"These actions against thousands of peaceful, hardworking residents represent a deliberate pattern of state-enabled violence against the urban poor, carried out to clear valuable land for elite interests and private mega-developments,\" the NGOs said.\\nAn official report released last year showed that while the city\\'s \"housing supply improved significantly from 1.4 million units in 2016 to over 2.57 million units in 2025, it has not kept pace with demand\".\\n\"The housing deficit has thus grown from approximately 2.95 million units in 2016 to 3.4 million in 2025, a 15 per cent increase,\" Nigeria\\'s Punch newspaper quoted the report as saying.\\nRapid population growth, rising rents and limited access to formal housing have pushed many low-income residents into informal settlements, particularly along waterfronts and transport corridors.\\nThe authorities have demolished homes in Makoko in the past - most recently in 2017, when residents obtained a court order to prevent forced evictions without adequate notice, compensation and resettlement.\\nMegan Chapman, co-director of the Justice and Empowerment Initiatives campaign group, says the government has failed to provide residents affected by the latest demolitions with alternative accommodation.\\n\"They have to identify everyone who will be affected and make arrangements before homes are lost,\" she tells the BBC\\n\"When people are removed like this, it affects livelihoods, family structures and how communities function over time.\"\\nWhen the BBC was in Makoko, boys were sitting along the lagoon, repairing their broken fishing nets. Children moved between piles of debris, collecting firewood from collapsed structures.\\nA tractor pulled away from what was once a house. Only a small number of buildings remained standing, including the homes of traditional leaders.\\nElizabeth Kakisiwe says she sleeps nearby.\\nEach evening, she lays wooden boards on damp ground for her children and packs them away again in the morning.\\n\"We were at the market when it started,\" she says. \"When I came back, my house was gone.\"\\nShe says there was no clear warning and no time to remove belongings. Clothes, cooking utensils and mattresses were lost. When rain fell days later, they were drenched.\\n\"At night, we sit in the cold,\" she says. \"If the children feel sick, we give them paracetamol.\"\\nCooking has become difficult, she says, because rain has made the ground wet and rats move through the debris.\\n\"Yesterday, we only drank garri,\" Kakisiwe says, referring to a popular cassava-based meal that is often made as a drink. \"There is nothing to cook.\"\\nExpressing a similar view, Sobie says: \"The suffering is much. A lot of people have been dying. We just don\\'t know what to say. It\\'s only God that can help us.\"\\nAdditional reporting by Gift Ufuoma\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

She was known for her versatility, blending jazz, opera, classical music and soul.\\nVideos shared on social media show a snake handler removing a snake from her apartment, as people nearby can be heard screaming: \"It is a cobra!\"\\nA close friend, Sam Ezugwu, the co-founder and music director of the Amemuso Choir where she sang, told the BBC that Nwangene was a \"rising star\".\\nHe said she had been planning to stage her first solo concert later this year. She was also a trained architect.\\nHillary Obinna, another friend who sang alongside her, told the BBC he was told she had been asleep when \"the snake bite woke her up\".\\nHe said that two snakes were later found in the house.\\nShe first sought treatment at a nearby clinic but they did not have any antivenom so she went to a hospital.\\nEzugwu said he rushed to the hospital on Saturday after learning that she had been taken there. He said the hospital had one of the required antivenoms but not the other.\\n\"While they were trying to stabilise her, she could not speak but she could make hand gestures. She was struggling to breathe,\" he added.\\nEzugwu said he drove out to search for the missing antivenom but returned to find that she had died.\\nHe said the entire choir went to the hospital that evening, \"hoping that a miracle would happen\".\\nIn a statement, the hospital denied that the venom had been unavailable and said claims its response had been inadequate were \"unfounded and do not reflect the reality of the situation\".\\nThe Federal Medical Centre, Jabi said on Sunday: \"Our medical staff provided immediate and appropriate treatment, including resuscitation efforts, intravenous fluids, intranasal oxygen, and the administration of polyvalent snake antivenom.\"\\nIt said a \"thorough but quick\" assessment showed Nwangene had suffered severe complications from the bite. Her condition suddenly deteriorated prior to a transfer to intensive care, it added, and medics had been \"unable to revive her\".\\n\"We stand by the quality of care and dedication our team demonstrates daily.\"\\nObinna described her friend as \"a very wonderful girl, she is humble – very intelligent and very talented\".\\n\"Everybody is shattered. We could not sleep at night.\"\\nNwangene\\'s death comes amid a renewed debate in Nigeria about the quality of healthcare and patient safety, following a series of allegations of medical negligence.\\nThese include the recent death of novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\\'s 21-month-old son. The hospital in that case has denied any wrongdoing.\\nIn response to the public outcry, Nigeria\\'s health minister has acknowledged \"systemic challenges\" in the health system and announced the creation of a national task force on \"clinical governance and patient safety\".\\nMost snake bite victims in Nigeria are believed to live in rural areas and many Nigerians are shocked at Nwangene\\'s death in an upmarket part of the capital.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says venomous snakebites are a neglected public health issue in many tropical and subtropical countries.\\nIn Africa, between 435,000 and 580,000 snakebites requiring treatment are recorded each year, according to the WHO. The burden falls mainly on women, children and farmers in rural communities, where health systems are weakest and medical resources limited.\\nThose bites cause about 30,000 deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa, though some estimates suggest the real number is much higher.\\nExperts say the shortage of antivenom is a major reason the scale of the problem is hard to assess. It leads many bite victims to seek care from traditional healers, meaning cases often go unrecorded.\\nEven where antivenom is available, it is often too expensive, and storage is difficult because most antivenoms require refrigeration in areas with unreliable electricity.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

At the time, the death toll remained unclear.\\nWomen and children were among those mining coltan - a mineral used to manufacture electronics such as smartphones and computers - at the time.\\nA former supervisor of the mine told the BBC the site was not properly maintained, making accidents more likely and hampering rescue efforts when they occur.\\nHe added that the fragile nature of the soil made the situation worse.\\nThe Congolese authorities have blamed the deaths on the rebels, saying they were putting the lives of civilians at risk through allowing illegal mining without enforcing safety standards.\\nThey said they had banned mining in the area last year, even though the rebels had already seized control of the mines by then.\\nThere have been numerous similar mine collapses in DR Congo over the years, including in areas controlled by the government.\\nWomen, children and artisanal miners - those not officially employed by a mining firm - are among those killed in the collapse. Around 20 survivors are said to be receiving treatment in hospital.\\nA source whose cousin died in the landslide expressed shock, saying it was \"a big loss\" for the family and community.\\n\"I didn\\'t believe he could pass away in such circumstances,\" the source, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC, describing his cousin as a \"courageous\" and \"ambitious\" man whose main goal was to provide for his wife and two children.\\n\"I didn\\'t believe [he was dead] because investigations were still ongoing.

Rwanda has denied giving military support to the M23.\\nIn its statement after the collapse, the Congolese government repeated its accusation that Rwanda was using the M23 to loot Congolese minerals.\\n\"Mining activities carried out in this context of armed occupation constitute a structured system of looting and illegal exploitation of natural resources, part of an illicit supply chain of industrial scale,\" it said.\\nAlthough Rwanda has always denied the accusation, UN experts say there is evidence that minerals from DR Congo are being exported through Rwanda.\\nThe mines in Rubaya hold about 15% of the world\\'s coltan supply and half of the DR Congo\\'s total deposits.\\nThe metallic ore contains tantalum, which is used to produce high-performance capacitors in a range of electronic devices, making it in high demand worldwide.\\nWhen a BBC team visited the site in July 2025, they observed miners digging manually to source the precious mineral. Conditions at the site are very bad, with dangerous pits dotted around its vast expanse.\\nSince 2024, the M23 rebels have been in control of the mines.

According to official statistics, the country is home to about 2.4 million migrants, about 4% of the population.\\nThe 51-year-old monarch did not advocate violence but said all \"kwerekwere\", an offensive word for African migrants, must pack their bags - even if they were in relationships with South Africans and had children with them.\\n\"We must now sit down and discuss this because even if my nephew\\'s father is a \\'kwerekwere\\', the \\'kwerekwere\\' must leave, only the child will remain,\" he said on Thursday to the delight of his audience - a response which prompted him to burst out laughing.\\nMany online have been quick to point out the irony of his remarks, considering the king\\'s own mother was from Eswatini and one of his wives is also from the neighbouring kingdom.\\nBut such xenophobic attitudes have long been an issue in South Africa, leading to deadly outbreaks of violence - and his comments echo those made by his late father Goodwill Zwelithini, who urged migrants in 2015 to \"pack their belongings\".\\nHe later tried to back-pedal, claiming he was misquoted, but the country\\'s human rights body found his comments \"hurtful and harmful\".\\nMore than a decade on, xenophobia and anger directed at migrants remain a key political issue - with some believing foreigners are stealing jobs and benefiting from public services meant for South Africans.\\nThe rate of unemployment in the country remains one of the highest in the world at around 33%.\\nThis is something new opposition parties - like uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) led by former President Jacob Zuma, whose main support base is in KwaZulu-Natal - have latched on to with populist policies that support the expulsion of undocumented migrants.\\nThis has led in recent years to the rise of vigilante anti-migrant groups, like Operation Dudula and March on March, which have gained notoriety for their demands that foreign nationals be removed from the country. \"Dudula\" means \"to remove something by force\" in the Zulu language.\\nTheir latest campaign took place a few days before the king\\'s speech and not long after the start of the academic year.\\nAn angry group of protesters descended on a primary school in the KwaZulu-Natal port city of Durban, claiming that 90% of the pupils there were the children of migrants.\\nThe heated demonstration forced the school to call parents to come and collect the students because of safety concerns - and the next day a large contingent of police was deployed to the gates of Addington Primary School.\\nThe local authorities hit out at the organisers of the march, which was also supported by MK, and accused them of spreading misinformation.\\n\"This has put a lot of people\\'s lives at risk. It is a lie that 90% of learners are children of immigrants. The truth is that immigrants form 37% of the learner population,\" Mlu Mtshali, an education spokesperson for KwaZulu-Natal, told South Africa\\'s Daily Maverick newspaper.\\nThis prompted the education department to reveal that nationally, 253,618 foreign pupils are enrolled in South Africa\\'s public schools - 1.8% of all students. Of these, 14,929 are at public schools in KwaZulu-Natal.\\nCommentators have also pointed out that in South Africa, all children have a legal right to basic education, irrespective of their nationality or status in the country.\\nFollowing the Addington Primary School protests and ahead of the Battle of Isandlwana commemoration, royal envoys hinted that King Misuzulu would address these concerns.\\nHe has no formal political power, but a fifth of South Africa\\'s population is Zulu and the monarchy remains hugely influential with a large budget funded by taxpayers.\\nThe king also oversees a trust that owns and controls vast tracts of communal land in KwaZulu-Natal, which is supposed to be for the benefit local communities.\\n\"We will speak to the \\'kwerekweres\\' and tell them to leave. There is nobody who does not have a home to return to,\" the king said.\\nFor Dr Vusumusi Sibanda, a human rights lawyer and expert on African diaspora issues, such words are \"unfortunate\" and \"worrying\" and encourage ordinary citizens to take the law into their own hands.\\n\"The king is respected by [many people], including foreigners, and he\\'s supposed to be that symbol,\" he told the BBC.\\nLizette Lancaster, who works at South Africa\\'s Institute for Security Studies think-tank, echoes this, telling me that the king\\'s comments only served to \"fuel anti-migrant sentiment and should be strongly condemned\".\\nShe also weighed in on the actions of vigilante groups, saying that while South African law protected activism, orchestrating vigilante activity \"including incitement or actions against migrants, must be identified and dealt with\".\\nThe leader of March on March, Jacinta Ngobese Zuma, is now facing a public violence charge over the protests at Addington Primary School.\\nAnd in November, a court ordered Operation Dudula to stop blocking foreign nationals from accessing public health facilities and schools, saying it was illegal.\\nAnother topic raised by the king that has the nation talking is his call to drop \"Natal\" from KwaZulu-Natal\\'s name - again echoing a wish of his father.\\n\"We need to remove this \\'Natal\\'. This is KwaZulu, so I don\\'t understand why we have this Natal,\" the king said.\\nPrior to 1994 and the end of South Africa\\'s racist system of apartheid, the province now known as KwaZulu-Natal was split into two.\\nKwaZulu was classified as a \"homeland\", a semi-autonomous area reserved for ethnic Zulus, which existed within Natal province.\\nWhen South Africa ushered in democratic rule with Nelson Mandela elected president, the two were merged and the name conjoined.\\nOver the last three decades, many cities, towns and roads in South Africa have been renamed, replacing them with indigenous ones or calling them after heroes of the struggle against apartheid.\\nBut for some commentators, the call to name the province simply KwaZulu is an unpalatable reminder of Zulu nationalism and its potential dangers.\\nIn the years after Mandela\\'s release from prison in 1990, political violence between his supporters and those of a Zulu nationalist party nearly derailed the process that led to the end of white-minority rule.\\nThere are fears that renaming KwaZulu-Natal would create a kind of exceptionalism that could lead to more trouble in the ethnically diverse country which has 11 official languages.\\nCultural expert Prof Musa Xulu is also quick to add that it would be wrong to regard KwaZulu-Natal as a Zulu province.\\n\"In reality, it\\'s a multicultural province,\" he told the BBC.\\n\"[Re]naming it KwaZulu would be a distortion of history. There was never a time in history when this whole region… was a kingdom of the Zulus,\" he said.\\nZulus \"don\\'t have the powers to simply push people around and say that the province should be known as KwaZulu\", the academic added.\\nUntil now King Misuzulu, on the throne since 2022, has mainly made the headlines with regard to the royal succession battle and his controversial divorce.\\nBut now he seems to be following in his father\\'s footsteps - and picking at scabs that never get a chance to heal in what is a politically charged environment.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'A fiery tweeter who is in charge of Uganda\\'s military, Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba is decried by his critics as being in the middle of an unholy trinity, or alliance, of three men who rule the East African nation with an iron fist.\\nKainerugaba, the son of the country\\'s long-time leader Yoweri Museveni, has posted on social platform X about the killing of opposition supporters during this month\\'s fiercely contested presidential election.\\nIn posts which were subsequently deleted, he also threatened to have the testicles of defeated opposition candidate Bobi Wine removed.\\nWith the 81-year-old president winning a seventh term, analysts say this is likely to be his last term and he is grooming his 51-year-son to succeed him.\\nThe so-called \"unholy alliance\" - a play on the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity - is made up of Museveni, Kainerugaba, and the president\\'s powerful brother and special adviser, Salim Saleh.\\nKenya-based analyst for the Institute for Security Studies think-tank, Nicodemus Minde, tells the BBC that he heard the description during a recent research trip to Uganda.\\n\"The Father being Museveni, then the Son being Muhoozi, then the Unholy Spirit could be the uncle, Salim Saleh,\" he says.\\nMinde describes Saleh as a \"power behind the scenes\", saying he was \"influential in terms of money, business and access\".\\nOpposition supporters accuse the family of believing they have a God-given right to rule Uganda, with Museveni extending his 40-year-rule after he was declared the winner of the election with more than 70% of the vote.\\nIndeed Anita Among, the speaker in the last parliament, also used the image of the holy trinity last year, as she rallied voters to back Museveni.\\n\"We believe in God the Father - and God the Father is President Museveni. God the Son is MK [Muhoozi Kainerugaba], and now you [the voters] are the Holy Spirit. Therefore, vote for them,\" she was quoted as saying in comments that came in for some criticism.\\nAfter getting just 24% of the vote, Wine dismissed the results as \"fake\", claiming widespread \"ballot-stuffing\" was behind Museveni\\'s victory.\\nThis incurred the wrath of Kainerugaba, who threatened the opposition leader, giving him \"exactly 48 hours to surrender himself to the police\".\\n\"If he doesn\\'t we will treat him as an outlaw/rebel and handle him accordingly,\" he wrote.\\nThose tweets - and the one in which he threatened to remove Wine\\'s testicles - have since been deleted.\\nWine, who had gone into hiding after a raid on his house following the election, later called out the general on X and included a screengrab of some of the deleted tweets - to which Kainerugaba responded with the comment: \"Boo hoo hoo Mr. 24%.\"\\nAnother tweet saying Wine was wanted \"dead or alive\" is still on his feed, even though a government minister has said the opposition leader is free to carry out his activities.\\nThe army chief later accused the US of helping Wine escape and said that all military co-operation between the two countries would be suspended.\\nOn Friday, he apologised, saying he had been given \"wrong information\".\\nHe subsequently announced \"I intend to reduce my interactions\" on the social media site. Last year, he said he would leave X before returning after just a few days.\\nKainerugaba has a long history of controversial posts, some of which have been later deleted, and is also known as the \"tweeting general\".\\nHe has also invoked religion to advance his political aspirations.\\n\"I fear no one on this planet because my bloodline is from Jesus Christ,\" he posted earlier this month. This tweet has also been deleted.\\nA long-time friend of the general, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says he is \"incredibly loyal\", and compares his posting to US President Donald Trump.\\n\"He might be Trumpian, but that\\'s him expressing himself,\" the friend tells the BBC.\\nHe says \"it is wrong to try to understand him from the tweets that he posts\", adding that Kainerugaba is \"a man of complex character\".\\nMinde describes the general\\'s posts as often \"wild\", but says that many of his comments can make sense when viewed within the context of Uganda\\'s succession politics - in particular Kainerugaba\\'s bid to position himself as his father\\'s heir.\\n\"He probably wants to endear himself to his father,\" Minde tells the BBC, but adds that some of the posts are deliberate \"provocations\".\\nHe says that Kainerugaba\\'s statements do little to win him public favour.\\nKainerugaba\\'s friend, on the other hand, tells the BBC the general would be an \"incredible successor\" to his father.\\nHe points out that Uganda is a post-conflict country where security is all-important.\\n\"This is our number-one priority, to make sure that you are peaceful and stable and [Kainerugaba] is very experienced in that sphere. He\\'s been doing this all his life,\" he adds.\\nHowever, some of his posts could threaten international relations if taken at face-value.\\nIn 2022 he threatened to invade neighbouring Kenya, triggering a backlash from Kenyans who trolled him for his \"reckless\" comments.\\nHe responded by urging them to \"relax\", but as the row escalated, Museveni was forced to phone his Kenyan counterpart William Ruto to apologise for his son\\'s \"mistake\".\\nKainerugaba has in the past downplayed some of his remarks as \"musings\" and \"abstractions\" that do not need to be taken seriously.\\nUganda-based security analyst Freddie David Egesa observes that the military chief \"enjoys having that kind of vibe\".\\n\"He sometimes likes joking around it,\" Egesa says.\\nKainerugaba\\'s friend says the general is \"a kind, generous, intensely smart person who spends all his time thinking about the peace and security of this country\".\\nHe adds that the general executes his responsibilities to the best of his abilities.\\n\"And that\\'s why he serves in the role that he serves.\"\\nCritics say Kainerugaba has brooked little opposition in the country, acting decisively against anyone perceived as a threat to his father\\'s administration.\\nBy the general\\'s own admission on X, at least 30 people were killed and 2,000 others detained by security officers following the recent elections.\\nBefore the polls, opposition rallies were disrupted, with security forces at times opening fire. The United Nations said the election was held in an \"environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation against the political opposition\".\\nKainerugaba played a role in the four-day internet blackout that lasted until after the elections, Reuters news agency quoted Andrew Mwenda, a Ugandan political commentator and close ally of the general, as saying.\\nThe internet remained partially restricted afterwards, but on Monday, Kainerugaba posted that access to all social media platforms was being restored.\\n\"We are releasing all social media today,\" he wrote.\\nOn the same day, he took to X to deny that his soldiers had beaten up Bobi Wine\\'s wife Barbara Kyagulanyi.\\nShe had alleged from her hospital bed on Saturday that military officers had assaulted her overnight as they searched for her husband.\\nAccording to Minde, Kainerugaba\\'s actions appear driven by loyalty or a desire to protect Museveni\\'s administration. The general\\'s first name, Muhoozi, means avenger.\\n\"I named him Muhoozi, which means vengeance, such that when someone wrongs me, he avenges,\" Museveni once explained.\\nKainerugaba, who was born in 1974, grew up in exile in Tanzania, Kenya and Sweden before his father took power in 1986 after overthrowing the brutal regime of Milton Obote.\\nHe joined the military in 1999, enrolled at the UK\\'s elite Sandhurst military academy and graduated the following year. He is married with several children.\\nHe rapidly rose through the military ranks shortly after joining the army, reaching the rank of lieutenant-general 10 years later. He was promoted to a full general in 2022.\\nHe played a pivotal role in the formation of the Special Forces Command (SFC), an elite military unit responsible for his father\\'s security.\\nThe SFC has been accused of involvement in a wave of abductions and torture of opposition members. It has denied the allegations, but some of its officers have been convicted of abusing their power.\\nThe most prominent case was that of a 32-year-old SFC soldier, who was court-martialled and sentenced to death in 2024 for shooting dead three people and injuring two others, including a one-year-old child.\\nAnd after a bodyguard of Wine, Edward Sebuufu went missing last May, Kainerugaba revealed on X that he was in detention \"in my basement\", and sparked a social media storm after he published a photo of him appearing half-naked and with his beard shaved off.\\nAs with Wine, he threatened to castrate Sebuufu.\\nWine has alleged that members of the SFC, as well as the military, were behind a raid on his home the day after the election.\\nThe unit is viewed as a shadow army that has helped Museveni, along with his ever-growing family dynasty, to consolidate power.\\nThe latest addition to the political dynasty is Kainerugaba\\'s son, Ruhamya, who has joined the army - seen as the first step to acquiring power in Uganda.\\nIn the years to come, the composition of the trinity could change, with Kainerugaba as the Father, Ruhamya as the Son and another family patriarch succeeding Saleh as the Spirit.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Long crowned by his legion of fans as the king of Afrobeat, the late Fela Kuti is finally being recognised by the global music industry.\\nThe Nigerian star will posthumously receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammys - almost three decades after his death at the age of 58.\\n\"Fela has been in the hearts of the people for such a long time. Now the Grammys have acknowledged it, and it\\'s a double victory,\" his musician son Seun Kuti tells the BBC.\\n\"It\\'s bringing balance to a Fela story,\" he adds.\\nRikki Stein, a long-time friend and manager of the late musician, says the recognition by the Grammys is \"better late than never\".\\n\"Africa hasn\\'t in the past rated very highly in their interests. I think that\\'s changing quite a bit of late,\" Stein tells the BBC.\\nFollowing the global success of Afrobeats, a genre inspired by Fela\\'s sound, the Grammys introduced the category of Best African Performance in 2024.\\nThis year, Nigerian superstar Burna Boy also has a nomination in the Best Global Music Album category.\\nBut Fela Kuti will be the first African to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award, albeit posthumously. The award was first presented in 1963 to American singer and actor Bing Crosby.\\nOther musicians who will receive the award this year include Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana, Chaka Khan, the American singer known as the Queen of Funk, and Paul Simon.\\nFela Kuti\\'s family, as well friends and colleagues, will be attending the Grammys to receive his award.\\n\"The global human tapestry needs this, not just because it\\'s my father,\" Seun Kuti tells the BBC.\\nStein says it is important to recognise Fela as a man who championed the cause of people who had \"drawn life\\'s short straw\", adding that he \"castigated any form of social injustice, corruption [and] mismanagement\" in government.\\n\"So it would be impossible to ignore that aspect of Fela\\'s legacy,\" he tells the BBC.\\nFor Fela Anikulapo Kuti was not simply a musician, but also a cultural theorist, political agitator and the undisputed architect of Afrobeat - which is distinct from, but ultimately led to, the modern sound of Afrobeats.\\nHe pioneered the Afrobeat genre alongside drummer Tony Allen, blending West African rhythms, jazz, funk, highlife, extended improvisation, call-and-response vocals and politically charged lyricism.\\nAcross a career spanning roughly three decades until his death in 1997, Fela Kuti released more than 50 albums and built a body of work that fused music with ideology, rhythm with resistance, and performance with protest.\\nHis music incurred the wrath of Nigeria\\'s then-military regimes.\\nIn 1977, after the release of the album Zombie, which satirised government soldiers as obedient, brainless enforcers, his compound in the main city, Lagos, was raided.\\nKnown as Kalakuta Republic, the property was burned, residents were brutalised, and his mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, later died from injuries sustained during the assault.\\nRather than retreat, Fela Kuti responded through music and defiance. He took his mother\\'s coffin to government offices and released the song Coffin for Head of State, turning grief into protest.\\nThe musician\\'s ideology was a blend of pan-Africanism, anti-imperialism, and African-rooted socialism.\\nFela Kuti\\'s mother was hugely influential in his life, helping shape his political consciousness, while the US-born singer and activist Sandra Izsadore helped sharpen his revolutionary outlook\\nHe was born Olufela Olusegun Oludoton Ransome-Kuti, but dropped Ransome because of its Western roots.\\nIn 1978, he married 27 women in a highly publicised ceremony, bringing together partners, performers, organisers and co-architects of the cultural and communal vision of Kalakuta Republic.\\nFela Kuti endured repeated arrests, beatings, censorship and surveillance by the security forces. Yet repression only amplified his influence.\\n\"He wasn\\'t doing what he was doing to win awards. He was interested in liberation. Freeing the mind,\" Stein tells the BBC.\\n\"He was fearless. He was determined.\"\\nFela Kuti\\'s musical evolution was shaped not only by Nigeria but also by Ghana. During the 1950s and 1960s, highlife music, pioneered by Ghanaian musicians such as ET Mensah, Ebo Taylor and Pat Thomas, became a defining sound across West Africa.\\nIts melodic guitar lines, horn sections, dance rhythms, and cosmopolitan identity deeply influenced Fela Kuti\\'s early musical direction.\\nHe spent time in Ghana absorbing highlife\\'s structure, horn phrasing, and dance-oriented arrangements before fusing it with jazz, funk, the rhythms of his own Yoruba people, and political storytelling.\\nThe DNA of highlife can be heard in Afrobeat\\'s melodic sensibility and its balance between groove and sophistication.\\nIn this sense, Afrobeat is not only Nigerian. It is West African, pan-African, and diasporic in origin, carrying Ghana\\'s musical imprint at its foundation.\\nOn stage, Fela Kuti cut an unmistakable figure. Often bare-chested or draped in the wax-printed fabric popular across West Africa, hair shaped into a crisp Afro, saxophone in hand, eyes alert with intensity, he commanded a large band of more than 20 musicians.\\nHis performances at the Afrika Shrine in Lagos were legendary, part concert, part political rally, part spiritual ceremony.\\nStein recalls that performances at the Shrine were immersive rather than conventional.\\n\"When Fela played, nobody applauded,\" he tells the BBC. \"The audience wasn\\'t separate. They were part of it.\"\\nMusic was not spectacle. It was communion.\\nFela Kuti\\'s visual identity was shaped in part by artist and designer Lemi Ghariokwu, who created 26 of his album covers between 1974 and 1993.\\n\"Fela has been an ancestor for 28 years. His legacy is growing by the day. This is immortality,\" Ghariokwu tells the BBC, welcoming the posthumous award.\\nToday, Fela Kuti\\'s music is still popular with millions around the world, and his influence is audible in modern artists such as Burna Boy, Kendrick Lamar and Sir Idris Elba.\\nElba is a huge fan - the award-winning actor and DJ has curated an official vinyl box set, Fela Kuti Box Set 6, and has publicly compared him to icons such as Sade and Frank Sinatra to illustrate the point that Fela Kuti has his own unique sound.\\nFela Kuti performed at major international festivals in Europe and North America, introducing global audiences to a bold and politically charged version of modern Africa.\\nSeun Kuti was just 14 when his father died.\\n\"Fela never made me feel like I was a child,\" he recalls. \"He didn\\'t hide anything from me. He talked about everything openly.\"\\nThere was no myth-building.\\n\"I didn\\'t even realise my dad was famous,\" he says. \"That\\'s credit to him. He kept me grounded.\"\\nWhat stayed with him most was not spectacle, but discipline, clarity and humanity.\\n\"The human part of him, leadership, musicianship, fatherhood, that was the epitome of who he was.\"\\nOne of Seun Kuti\\'s most revealing reflections speaks to independence and identity.\\n\"Fela was our dad, but you didn\\'t own him. Fela belonged to himself. But we all belonged to him.\"\\nFela Kuti insisted on being addressed by name, not by title, even by his children. Seun recalls having his pocket money docked after calling him \"Pops\", a moment that carried a lesson in respect.\\n\"He always reminded us that he was in service to others more than himself.\"\\nThat ethic shaped Seun\\'s evolution from youthful ambition toward cultural responsibility.\\n\"I used to make music to make money. But as I\\'ve grown, I lean more toward working for my people as well as my art.\"\\nFela Kuti led multiple ensembles, most famously Africa 70 and later Egypt 80, the latter now carried forward by his son.\\nThese were not conventional backing bands. They were musical militias, trained in discipline, endurance, and ideological purpose.\\nStein recalls Fela Kuti\\'s obsessive attention to detail.\\n\"He tuned every instrument personally.

       "  'Article': 'A Nigerian oil minister went on \"extravagant and excessive\" spending sprees at high-end London stores with money from bribes by industry insiders, a London court has heard.\\nDuring a visit to Harrods in 2013, Diezani Alison-Madueke ordered thousands of pounds worth of rugs, including by luxury brand Alexander McQueen, Southwark Crown Court was told.\\nProsecutors allege the 65-year-old was provided with \"a life of luxury in the United Kingdom\" by those interested in Nigerian government contracts.\\nAlison-Madueke, who was Nigeria\\'s minister of petroleum resources between 2010 and 2015, denies five counts of accepting bribes and a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery.\\nThe court heard that during the Harrods visit in November 2013, Alison-Madueke was allegedly accompanied by Nigerian businessman Kolawole Aluko and a security guard.\\nAccording to a sales executive working in the store, the then-minister looked \"extremely glamorous and was wearing very expensive clothing\".\\nAlison-Madueke was also a regular shopper at Vincenzo Cafferella, a decorative arts and furniture store in north London, where she was known as \"Sharon D\", the court was told.\\nThe prosecution alleges that between October 2012 and November 2013, Aluko bought various items, including lamps and tables, for Alison-Madueke costing more than £370,000.\\nThe court heard Alison-Madueke would also spend hours in Thomas Goode, a china and silverware shop in Mayfair, and once arrived with an entourage of about four or five people.\\nA worker there remembered her loving the sales and saying to him: \"I don\\'t even know why I\\'m buying this, I haven\\'t got the room for it.\"\\nThe court was told items were often bought but not collected and that Alison-Madueke never paid for anything herself.\\nInstead, the bills were understood to be settled by Aluko and other Nigerian businessmen said to own energy companies that had lucrative contracts with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation when Alison-Madueke was oil minister.\\nEx-Nigeria oil minister in bribery trial spent £2m at Harrods, court hears\\nThe court was also told about shipments of furniture bought for Alison-Madueke from a luxury store in Houston, Texas for several properties in London which the prosecution allege were used by the former minister.\\nTwo of the properties were said to be bought by Nigerian businessman Benedict Peters. The jury was shown photographs from inside one of them, which included items allegedly bought for Alison-Madueke.\\nAlison-Madueke\\'s driver recalled collecting her and then-President of Nigeria Goodluck Jonathan from the same address, the court heard.\\nOther spending on the minister\\'s behalf allegedly included £89,410 to charter a jet from Luton to Lagos in Nigeria in January 2012, as well as a delivery of £100,000 cash from a bank in north London to her at a nearby flat.\\nThe court was also told that Alison-Madueke\\'s phone was seized in 2015 during police searches, revealing recorded conversations in which she is said to have confronted Aluko over suggestions he had spoken about the gifts given to her at a time when their relationship was breaking down.\\nIn a conversation in May 2014, Alison-Madueke told Aluko she was really annoyed, given that she and others had \"stuck our necks out\" when negotiating oil mining leases.\\n\"I will be happy to escort all of you to jail along with myself… you\\'ll be shocked what I will do\", she is alleged to have said, adding: \"I will come out and tell the Nigerian people this is what happened.\\n\"Oh yes, I will blame myself… I will come out openly and say it so that they can judge me openly. And then all of us go and sit on the gate let us see who survived.\"\\nIn another instance, Igho Sanomi, an oil executive whose company was awarded Nigerian state contracts between 2011 and 2015, carried out shopping errands in London for Alison-Madueke, the court heard.\\nText messages recovered from her phone showed Sanomi pledging his \"loyalty and commitment\", and agreeing to collect Louis Vuitton hat boxes, replying: \"Yes Your Excellency consider this done\".\\nBy 2014 he expressed concern their relationship was deteriorating and so he allegedly sent Alison-Madueke an email calling himself her \"true soldier\".\\nThree weeks later, Sanomi\\'s company was part of a consortium that was awarded a new oil mining lease by her, the court heard.\\nAlison-Madueke\\'s brother, former bishop Doye Agama, 69, is also charged with conspiracy to commit bribery, with prosecutors claiming he was paid £1.2m in bribes by businessman Peters.\\nThe payments were intended to \"induce Alison-Madueke to perform her duties as the Nigerian minister of petroleum resources improperly,\" lawyers told the court.\\nAlso on trial is industry executive Olatimbo Ayinde, 54, who is charged with one count of bribery relating to Alison-Madueke and a separate count of bribery of a foreign public official.\\nBoth Agama and Ayinde deny the charges.\\nThe trial continues.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'It was hard to miss 33-year-old model and writer Abena Christine Jon\\'el\\'s appearance at a recent major fashion show in Ghana.\\nWalking the runway with her prosthetic leg wrapped in a colourful African print her appearance made a big impact.\\nThe Ghanaian-American was hoping to make a statement about the visibility of people with disabilities, building on years of work in the US and here in Ghana of speaking out on the issue.\\nAt two years old, Abena\\'s life became defined by a challenge most adults would struggle to face.\\nA large tumour had appeared on her right calf, the first sign of a rare, aggressive soft-tissue cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma. Doctors presented her mother with a difficult choice: radiation, which could have left her dependent on a wheelchair, or amputation. Her mother chose the latter.\\n\"It was the best decision she could have made,\" Abena says today without hesitation, speaking to the BBC surrounded by friends and family at a restaurant in the Ghanaian capital, Accra.\\nShe now lives in Ghana, but she grew up in Chicago in the US.\\nEven before she understood what cancer was, her early life was shaped by treatment and recovery. Movement became a way of measuring survival and rebuilding confidence. In a way, it was taking ownership of a body that had been through so much.\\nBut when she speaks about her younger years, it is not the cliché story of the inspirational disabled child sometimes presented in glossy campaigns: a compliant person bravely but silently triumphing against adversity.\\nShe rejects that stereotype entirely.\\n\"People imagine disabled kids as straight-A students who are sweet, quiet and perfect,\" she says.\\n\"I was the opposite. I was loud, I was a little black girl running around on one leg, I did not let anyone push me around, and I was struggling through school.\"\\nHer disability never softened her personality, it sharpened it.\\nAnd that sharpness, what she now jokingly describes as her \"professionally inspirational\" energy, is the very thing that would later carry her through life.\\nIn the US, she worked as a writer – initially as a poet – and then became a public speaker talking about her life experiences, in the hope of inspiring people.\\nShe wanted people to see what she was accomplishing and to \"let me hold a mirror so you can see yourself and what you can accomplish if you believe\".\\nLong before she dabbled with public speaking or modelling, Abena felt a pull towards Africa, a feeling she could not articulate but could not ignore.\\nAs a young adult in the US, she immersed herself in books on the history of Africa before colonialism, particularly West Africa. The more she read, the stronger the pull became.\\nBut it was her first visit to Ghana in 2021 that changed everything.\\nIn the central region of Ghana, standing at the Assin Manso slave river site – where enslaved people were sold before travelling about 40km (25 miles) south to the coast - she experienced what she describes as \"a moment that rearranged my entire understanding of myself\".\\nThe weight of history met the weight of belonging, forming a sense of identity she had never felt growing up in the US.\\nWhen she returned, she fell into a deep depression.\\n\"It felt like I had finally found a missing part of myself in Ghana,\" she says.\"Leaving felt like being torn away from somewhere my soul belonged.\"\\nThree months later, she packed her bags and moved permanently.\\nGhana embraced her in ways she still struggles to describe.\\n\"I am Ghanaian by ancestry and adoption,\" she says with pride.\\nOver the four years she has lived in Accra, Ghanaians have claimed her in the way only Ghana knows how, with warmth, with teasing, with family, and with names. She now lives with a Ghanaian mother who introduces her as her own daughter.\\n\"My Ghanaian identity is not pretend,\" she says. \"It is not cosplay. It is ancestral. Like Kwame Nkrumah said: \\'I am not African because I was born in Africa, but because Africa was born in me.\\' That is exactly what Ghana is to me.\"\\nHer prosthetic leg itself is a declaration of that love.\\nWrapped in kente, it is as much a cultural symbol as it is a mobility aid.\\n\"It always has been, and always will be, kente,\" she says. \"It represents my love for this country, its heritage, its pride.\"\\nLiving with a disability in Ghana has brought a new mission into her life, one that goes far beyond personal expression.\\nFor Abena, the difference between how disabled people are treated in the US and Ghana comes down to visibility and access.\\n\"In the States, progress is happening, slowly, imperfectly, but happening. Disabled people are being invited into more spaces,\" she explains. \"It is still ableist, but at least there is an attempt to change the narrative.\"\\nGhana, she says, is still at the beginning of that journey. Not for lack of compassion, but for lack of representation.\\nAfter her move, she continued to speak out for the rights of people with disabilities.\\n\"In Ghana, disabled people have not been widely showcased in a positive light,\" she says. \"So stigma thrives. Negativity thrives. People do not see us in powerful or beautiful or joyful positions, they see us only in struggle.\"\\nHer advocacy is built on changing that perception. Not with pity, but with visibility.\\nWith her kente prosthetic, unfiltered personality and refusal to shrink herself to fit public expectations, Abena wants Ghanaians to see disabled people as they are: ambitious, stylish, talented, complex, proud and human.\\n\"Disability is not a limitation. Having a disability is not what makes you disabled,\" she says.\\n\"Lack of support, lack of accessibility, that is what disables you.\"\\nHer advocacy found a new stage, literally, at the 15th edition of Rhythms on the Runway, one of Africa\\'s most celebrated annual fashion shows, which took place last month at Accra\\'s historic Osu Castle.\\nIn the build-up to the show, Abena approached the organisers directly.\\nShe knew what her presence would mean, not just for herself, but for Ghana. She wanted to open the door to a different kind of representation, to force a conversation the country had delayed for too long.\\n\"I knew it would be a monumental moment for Rhythms on the Runway and for Ghana,\" she says. \"If I wanted inclusivity in the industry, I had to be willing to take that first step.\"\\nAnd she did.\\nWhen she stepped onto the runway, draped in fabric and confidence, her prosthetic gleaming under the spotlights, the room shifted. What happened next became one of the most talked about moments of the night.\\n\"Her strength showed right through, speaking volumes. \\'I am differently able and I have got this,\\'\" Tourism, Culture and Arts Minister Abla Dzifa Gomashie said.\\n\"Her walk was not just a performance it was a powerful affirmation that talent, beauty, and confidence know no limitations. We are proud to have provided a platform where her light could shine so boldly,\" fashion show organiser Shirley Emma Tibilla said.\\n\"Abena\\'s presence was absolutely powerful. This is what true inclusion looks like, celebrating every story, everybody, and every ability,\" Dentaa Amoateng, entrepreneur and founder of the Guba diaspora investment awards added.\\nBut for Abena, the significance of the evening was not the applause. It was the message. Disabled people were not just spectators that night, they were centre stage.\\nStanding at the intersection of identity, disability, heritage and fashion, Abena represents a new way forward for Ghana, one where inclusion is not quietly suggested, but boldly demanded.\\nHer journey from a two-year-old cancer patient to a woman reshaping how Ghana sees disability is not a story of survival, it is a story of reclamation.\\nShe reclaimed her identity, reclaimed her mobility, reclaimed her belonging and reclaimed her place in a country that, in her words, \"fought for me before I even stepped foot here\".\\nHer work is far from finished. But whether she is on a runway, behind a microphone, or mentoring young amputees, one thing is constant, she refuses to dim her light. And she refuses to let others like her be dimmed either.\\n\"Ghana is my home,\" she says.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

He said the house continued to be surrounded by the military.\\nSpeaking from hospital, Barbara Kyagulanyi said the officers had demanded to know Wine\\'s whereabouts and had assaulted her when she refused.\\nIt comes after the recent landslide victory of long-serving leader, and Kainerugaba\\'s father, President Yoweri Museveni. Wine rejected the results citing fraud.\\nOn Monday, the general posted on X that \"my soldiers did not beat up Barbie [Bobi Wine\\'s] wife\".\\n\"First of all, we do not beat up women. They are not worth our time. We are looking for her cowardly husband not her,\" he said.\\nSince Museveni was announced the winner of the 15 January election, the military chief has demanded Wine\\'s surrender and has issued death threats against him.\\nWine said on Monday that Kainerugaba was still looking for him \"and issuing threats to harm me\" and thanked the people for continuing to keep him safe.\\n\"My wife is still recovering from the trauma of an overnight raid and assault... My home is still surrounded by the military,\" he added in a post on X.\\nFrom her hospital bed, Barbara Kyagulanyi had described how dozens of men had broken into her house, some in military uniform, harassing and assaulting her.\\nShe said one of the men \"hit me on the face and tore my lip\". She said the officer had lifted her from behind by the waistband of her trousers while another choked her as she hung mid-air.\\nShe said the first officer pulled off her blouse, leaving her partially naked, though it was later given back.\\nShe said the officer also pulled her hair and \"hit me on the face and tore my lip\".\\nBarbara Kyagulanyi said she passed out after the ordeal. According to Wine, she was taken to hospital \"with both physical and psychological trauma\".\\nSince the election, the opposition has alleged that its supporters have been targeted by the security forces.\\nKainerugaba said on Friday that security officers had killed 30 supporters of the opposition National Unity Party (NUP) led by Wine and detained 2,000 others.\\nLawmaker Muwanga Kivumbi, who is a close Wine ally, was arrested for his alleged role in election-related violence last week, which the party denied.\\nThe Uganda Law Society denounced the \"ongoing wave of detentions, torture and enforced disappearance\" of opposition leaders and supporters\".\\n\"No-one should be subjected to violence by security forces under the pretext of national security,\" the society said on Sunday.\\nUganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence.\\nMuseveni first came to office as a rebel leader in 1986 and will have served for 45 years when the next term ends in 2031.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

Elders say a similar disaster took place in the 1990s,\" 24-year-old mechanic Tomaz Antonio Mlau says.\\nMlau and his family, who live near Marracuene - a town 30km (19 miles) north of the capital, Maputo - woke up to find their house inundated after the Inkomati River burst its banks.\\n\"When a rescue boat came a few hours afterwards, we did not hesitate to board it and come to safety in Marracuene town,\" he said, adding they had to abandon all their belongings and only managed to bring a change of clothes.\\nMlau, his wife and two children have found refuge at one of six centres - schools and churches - that are so far sheltering about 4,000 people.\\nMany of those gathered at Gwazamutini Secondary School are farmers from the low-lying areas with livestock and rice fields.\\n\"We lost everything in the floodwaters, including houses, TV sets, fridges, clothing and livestock - cattle, goats and pigs. Our farms are under water. I am a farmer. I grow quality rice,\" 67-year-old Francisco Fernando Chivindzi told me.\\nHis home is in Hobjana, one of several flooded neighbourhoods between the left bank of the Incomati River and the coastal tourism resort of Macaneta. Marracuene town is on the river\\'s right bank.\\n\"The floodwaters reached heights we weren\\'t expecting. We have never experienced this level of flooding in my lifetime,\" Chivindzi said.\\n\"We are happy to be here on higher ground. However, we are very worried that all our belongings were left behind.\"\\nThe farmer expressed his gratitude to the boat owners who came to assist him and his neighbours free of charge - and he urged others to save themselves.\\n\"We hear that there are still some people resisting - clinging to treetops and on roofs. I wish they would heed the rescuers and join us here in this temporary shelter. We should value life more than the goods,\" the father of nine said.\\nThis was a view echoed by Shafee Sidat, the mayor of the Marracuene municipality, as he visited Gwazamutini Secondary School on Saturday.\\n\"We still have people to rescue, some of whom refuse to abandon the risk areas. That\\'s a challenge. We reckon that more than 10,000 people are affected in Marracuene as a whole,\" he told me.\\nAt least 642,122 people have been affected since 7 January by flooding - particularly in southern and central regions, with 12 deaths recorded so far, according to provisional data from the National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction.\\nIn total 125 people have died in Mozambique since the rainy season began in October.\\nMayor Sidat fears the situation is likely to get worse because of heavy rain in neighbouring South Africa, the source of the Inkomati River.\\n\"We are worried about discharges of a South African dam on the Inkomati River. Our town is the last one downstream,\" the mayor said.\\n\"Before the waters flow into the Indian Ocean, they flood the \\'machambas\\' (farmlands), homes and grazing areas here in the low-lying zones.\"\\nSome aerial views show water as far as the eye can see. Hundreds of families remain cut off.\\nAll vehicles have now been banned from roads between the provinces of Maputo and Gaza to the north.\\nTransport Minister João Matlombe said it was because main roads, in particular the N1 highway which runs the whole length of the country and is the only link to the north, were flooded.\\nThe suspension is already leading to shortages and price hikes, including of basic foodstuffs, coconut and fuel - even as far away as the north-western city of Tete, more than 1,500km from Maputo.\\nFor those at shelters in Marracuene, food is also a challenge.\\n\"There isn\\'t yet enough food to eat,\" said Aninha Vicente Mivinga, whose two children are aged two and five.\\n\"On the first day this Friday, there was almost nothing to eat. It was painful to see children sleeping without anything to eat, except biscuits. Today things improved,\" she said.\\nMivinga, who is a police officer and farms in her spare time, described how she was at work in Marracuene town when the floods hit at her home in Hobjana.\\nThe 32-year-old had taken the precaution of taking her children to stay with family members who lived on higher ground because of the continuous rain, but even they were affected by the rising waters.\\n\"To learn that my children and other members of the family were on floodwaters and at risk of dying was horrific. I was devastated and completely shaken,\" the officer said.\\n\"Eventually my relatives were brought to safety.\\n\"It is the first time since I was born that we\\'ve been affected by flooding of this dimension.\"\\nMivinga said that students were meant to resume classes soon - and she would like the authorities to find permanent alternative accommodation for them.\\nHundreds of people are currently camping down in the classrooms using a traditional wrap cloth as bedding on which to lie down.\\n\"When floodwaters subside, I believe everyone would love to go back home, but it\\'s too risky. If only the authorities could give us another place on safer ground. We would go back to the risky area only for farming purposes but live on safer ground,\" the police officer said.\\nEducation Minister Samaria Tovela has already hinted that the cabinet is to consider rescheduling the start of the 2026 academic year, originally planned to begin next week, \"to allow flood victims to continue using them as accommodation centres, especially in the provinces of Maputo and Gaza, the most affected at the moment\".\\nChivindzi, who is not sure that the floodwaters will recede before schools resume, is determined to return home.\\n\"We\\'ll restart life from scratch,\" the farmer says.\\nMlau, who is unable to get to the garage where he works, is less sure of the future and the risks of starting again in the same place.\\n\"Even if waters subside, I am not sure I\\'ll go back there.\"\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

The latest fighting has threatened Jonglei\\'s capital, Bor, three hours\\' drive from Juba.\\nSPLA-IO\\'s leader, suspended First Vice-President Riek Machar, is currently on trial on charges of murder, treason and crimes against humanity, which he denies.\\nThere are fears that the fighting could re-ignite a full-blown civil war in the country.\\nConflict in South Sudan, the world\\'s youngest nation, broke out in 2013, two years after independence, when President Salva Kiir accused Machar of plotting to overthrow him.\\nA 2018 peace deal ended the civil war that had killed nearly 400,000 people, but it has never been properly implemented and the relationship between Kiir and Machar has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.\\nReinforcements from the South Sudanese army have now been deployed to Bor, which was the first place to be captured by opposition forces in the 2013-2018 conflict. The town is seen as a strategic staging post on the way to the capital.\\n\"We brought you here for a mission,\" chief of the defence force Gen Paul Nang Majok told his troops.\\n\"I am giving you seven days only to finish the mission – to crush the rebellion in those areas and recapture them.\"\\nThe South Sudanese army is being supported by soldiers from Uganda. Their exact number is not known. One report put the figure at 4,000, but this has not been confirmed.\\nThe soldiers are now preparing to advance into the areas held by SPLA-IO forces, national broadcaster SSBC has reported.\\nAnalysts believe the threats by the SPLA-IO forces to advance towards Juba with the aim of occupying it are meant to put pressure on the government to release Machar.\\nEarlier this week, Kiir sacked Machar\\'s wife, Angelina Teny, from her position as interior minister in the unity government and replaced her with someone from his own party. The move sparked criticism and worries that it could escalate the conflict.\\nThe UN\\'s peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Jonglei and other areas experiencing violence in the country.\\nUnmiss acting head of mission Kiki Gbeho urged the leaders of South Sudan to commit to \"immediately ceasing hostilities, de-escalating tensions, and advancing reconciliation and peace through inclusive dialogue under the framework of the peace agreement\".\\nThe UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan also expressed alarm at the deteriorating political and security situation and had a similar message to Unmiss.\\nCommission chair Yasmin Sooka expressed deep alarm at the reports of repeated airstrikes in parts of Jonglei, which have killed and injured civilians, destroyed homes, markets and medical facilities, and triggered large-scale displacement.\\nEarlier this month, SPLA-IO acting chief of staff, Lt Gen Peter Thok Chuol Luak, issued a warning to Juba\\'s residents, saying its forces would launch attacks near the city.\\n\"This warning precedes imminent military confrontations in Juba. We strongly recommend that all South Sudanese citizens in areas on the outskirts of Juba either evacuate or remain indoors,\" Gen Thok wrote.\\nThe governor of the state that includes Juba, Emmanuel Adil Anthony, has urged residents to ignore the threats made by the SPLA-IO.\\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'India\\'s philanthropy story is usually told from the top down.\\nIt features corporate social responsibility (CSR) budgets, billionaire pledges and splashy foundations. But a new report argues that the real engine of Indian generosity is far more prosaic - and vastly larger.\\nThe How India Gives 2025 report, produced by the Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy (CSIP) at Ashoka University, challenges the conventional narrative that organised, institutional money dominates the country\\'s giving landscape. Instead, it points to a quieter colossus: households.\\nAccording to the report, India\\'s total household giving is estimated at 540bn rupees ($6bn) annually, including cash, in-kind contributions and volunteering.\\nAbout 68% of respondents report giving in some form. Of this, 48% is in kind - such as food, clothing or other household goods - followed by cash donations (44%) and volunteering (30%) with non-profits, religious institutions or community groups.\\nMuch of the food given goes to communal free kitchens. Volunteering most commonly takes the form of service at religious institutions, including activities such as disaster relief organised by them.\\n\"India is a very generous country. Our findings suggest that ordinary households play a much larger role than is commonly acknowledged. Generosity appears widespread and culturally embedded,\" Jinny Uppal, head of Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy at Ashoka University, told the BBC.\\nThe headline insight: Indian philanthropy is not elite-led but mass, local and relational - driven by faith, face-to-face appeals and everyday obligation, cutting across income levels.\\nThe survey draws on more than 7,000 interviews across 20 states, spanning urban and rural India.\\nThe analysis is anchored to India\\'s National Sample Survey (NSS) consumption data - a large, government-run household expenditure survey - to build income-segmented profiles of everyday givers. Respondents self-reported how often and how much they gave over a three-month recall period. The findings were then extrapolated to produce annual estimates.\\nThe survey looks at \"everyday giving\" which includes both direct, personal help - to beggars, family or friends, often seen as charity - and donations to organised, non-religious institutions, which are typically described as philanthropy.\\nIt also examines \"retail giving\", typically defined as donations by ordinary individuals - not high-net-worth donors - to registered nonprofits. The survey adopts a broader lens, including informal, direct help to individuals as well as donations to religious institutions.\\nA lot of giving is shaped by proximity and faith, the survey found.\\nRoughly 40–45% of giving flows to religious organisations, with a comparable share directed to beggars and destitute people, especially in urban areas. In rural India, religious institutions take the lead.\\n\"We asked behavioural questions about motivation. For more than 90% of respondents, the underlying driver is a sense of religious duty - a moral obligation that shapes and sustains their giving,\" says Krishanu Chakraborty, head of research at the Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy at Ashoka University.\\nThe most common way people encounter giving opportunities is in-person requests or canvassing - meaning direct appeals at homes, religious sites or public spaces, rather than digital campaigns or formal fundraising drives.\\nThe survey found education correlates with generosity: donor participation peaks among graduates and postgraduates.\\nYet, giving is not confined to the affluent. Even at low consumption levels (4,000–5,000 rupees per month), about half of households report giving; as incomes rise, participation climbs to 70–80%.\\nGender patterns are subtle but telling: male-headed households are slightly more inclined toward religious giving, while female-headed households lean marginally toward supporting destitute individuals.\\n\"The most important takeaway [of the survey] is that everyday generosity in India is systemic rather than sporadic,\" Uppal says.\\n\"It cuts across income groups, age, gender and urban/rural regions and is embedded in everyday social life.\"\\nThe second key takeaway: estimates suggest that everyday giving makes up about 15% of total giving in India, yet accounts for nearly a third of private donations to the organised social sector.\\n\"Even with the small cheque size from everyday givers, this is a sizeable contribution from the citizenry towards social impact,\" says Uppal.\\nThe final takeaway, according to the researchers, is more methodological.\\nThe survey responses were anchored to consumption data, allowing researchers to examine how spending patterns relate to giving. As household consumption rises, both participation in giving and the amount donated tend to increase, the survey found.\\n\"India remains one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and consumption is a major component of GDP. As household consumption expands over time, this segment of everyday giving is likely to evolve and potentially grow alongside it,\" says Uppal.\\nIn mature markets, everyday individual giving is the financial backbone of NGOs - formal, tracked and institutionalised.\\nIn 2024, individuals gave $392bn in the US, accounting for 66% of all charitable donations. In the UK, public donations reached $20.7bn, with legacies and individual giving making up roughly 30% of charitable income.\\nThis is not surprising, say experts. Across much of the Global South, person-to-person, informal giving often exceeds formal donations. In advanced economies, by contrast, giving is largely channelled to registered nonprofits - helped by tax incentives and older, more organised charitable sectors.\\nThe US Generosity Commission\\'s 2024 report noted an apparent decline in everyday giving. But it tracks only audited donations to registered nonprofits made through tax channels.\\nAs giving shifts toward informal routes - online transfers, crowdfunding and other unaudited platforms - much of this behaviour goes uncaptured. Even in the US, the way people give is changing, experts believe.\\nIn India, says Uppal, the \"real headline\" isn\\'t the percentage - it\\'s the breadth of participation.\\nThe survey, she says, was conducted in March–April, months with relatively few religious events or festivals. \"Given the high percent of giving to religious organisations, it is safe to assume that during other months with religious occasions, a larger percent of the population gives.\"\\nIn other words, in India generosity is possibly not a trickle from the top. It is a daily tide from below.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Philippine Vice-President Sara Duterte has declared her candidacy for president in the 2028 elections.\\nThe 47-year-old\\'s announcement comes as she is embroiled in a bitter power struggle with current President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.\\nWhile the presidential vote is two years away, contenders in the Philippines\\' largely personality-based elections are known to prepare for years in advance.\\nMarcos is ineligible for re-election and his allies have yet to field a challenger to Duterte - who is also the daughter of his predecessor, former president Rodrigo Duterte.\\n\"I offer my life, my strength, and my future in the service of our nation,\" the vice-president said.\\n\"I am Sara Duterte. I will run for president of the Philippines.\"\\nMarcos and Duterte ran under the same ticket in the 2022 election, which they won by a landslide.

The elder Duterte is now detained at The Hague, awaiting trial for crimes against humanity over his violent war on drugs.\\nTwo months later, a mid-term legislative vote, seen as a barometer of support for the incumbent government, delivered a victory for candidates endorsed by the Duterte family, against those handpicked by Marcos.\\nJust over a week ago, members of the Catholic clergy filed an impeachment complaint against the vice-president over alleged corruption, which she denies.\\nSara is Rodrigo Duterte\\'s eldest daughter and is widely-considered as his political heir.\\nThe elder Duterte once described his daughter as the \"alpha\" in their family, the one whom everyone follows.\\nSara served as vice-mayor to her father when he led Davao city in the 2010s. It was in that southern metropolis that the Duterte\\'s built their reputation for being tough on crime, which they have described as necessary to keep people safe and encourage businesses to grow.\\nSara was thrust into the national spotlight when, in defence of shanty town dwellers, she punched a Davao sheriff in full view of TV news cameras.\\nShe was Davao city mayor when her father was president from 2016 and 2022, and her alliance with Marcos in the 2022 elections was pivotal for both their election victories.\\nThe vice-president, like her father, projects a tough image.

       "  'Article': 'Last month at Tokyo\\'s Ueno Zoo, after receiving thousands of tearful goodbyes from Japanese fans, Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei were put on a plane bound for China - the latest symbols of the deteriorating relationship between China and Japan.\\nThe two giant Chinese pandas had to return home after Beijing announced it was taking them back, leaving Japan without any Chinese pandas for the first time in decades.\\nSince Japan\\'s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi made comments that have plunged ties with China to their lowest level in years, Beijing has been piling on the pressure in a wide range of ways - sending warships, throttling rare earth exports, curbing Chinese tourism, cancelling concerts and even reclaiming its pandas.\\nAs Takaichi begins a new term as PM after winning a historically strong public mandate from a recent snap election, analysts warn that both sides will find it difficult to de-escalate - and the China-Japan relationship will not recover anytime soon.\\nThe row began in November, when Takaichi appeared to suggest that Japan would activate its self-defence force in the event of an attack on Taiwan.\\nChina claims self-governed Taiwan as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunify\" with it one day. The island counts the US as its key ally, and Washington has pledged to help Taiwan defend itself.\\nThe worry has long been that any attack on Taiwan could result in a direct military conflict between the US and China, and then widen to include other US allies in the region such as Japan and the Philippines.\\nThe issue of Taiwan is an absolute red line for China, which reacts furiously to any comment perceived as \"outside interference\" and insists that it is a question of sovereignty that only China can decide for itself.\\nAlmost immediately after Takaichi\\'s remarks, Beijing responded with a flurry of condemnation and demanded a retraction.\\nObservers have noted that Takaichi\\'s comments were in line with the government\\'s position and what other Japanese leaders have said in the past.\\nBut the difference is that it was the first time a sitting Japanese prime minister had voiced such views.\\nFor her part, Takaichi refused to apologise or retract her remarks, a stance that analysts say may likely be vindicated by the strong mandate she has won.\\nBut she said she would be more careful about commenting on specific scenarios, and her government has sent senior diplomats to meet their Chinese counterparts.\\nThis, however, has done little to allay Chinese anger.\\n\\nFaced with Takaichi\\'s steady refusal to back down, China has piled on a steady stream of pressure.\\nWhile spats have flared up between the two countries in recent decades, fueled by historical animosity, this time it feels different, say analysts.\\nChina has expanded its pressure on a much \"wider range of fronts\", noted Robert Ward, the Japan chair for the think tank International Institute of Strategic Studies.\\nIt is a diffuse, low-level pressure that is similar to the \"greyzone warfare\" it conducts on Taiwan, he said, where it\\'s aimed at \"wearing down [the opponent] to normalise things that actually are not normal\".\\nDiplomatically, it has lodged complaints with the United Nations and postponed a trilateral summit with Japan and South Korea.\\nChina has also tried to pull other parties into the fray and has called on the UK and France to side with it, while urging its allies Russia and North Korea to denounce Japan.\\nOver the weekend, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi invoked Japan\\'s World War Two history of aggression while addressing Western leaders at the Munich Security Conference, and called Takaichi\\'s remarks a \"very dangerous development\".\\nOn the military front, Japan has claimed that China has sent drones, sailed warships past their islands and its fighter jets have \"locked radars\" on their planes. Japanese and Chinese coast guard ships have confronted one another near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, while last week Japanese authorities seized a Chinese fishing vessel.\\nBut it is clear that China also wants to hit Japan where it hurts - its economy.\\nBeijing has imposed restrictions on exports to Japan for dual-use technologies including rare earth elements and critical minerals, in what has been seen as a form of economic coercion.\\nIt has also warned Chinese citizens to avoid Japan for their studies and holidays, and cancelled flight on 49 routes to Japan, leading to a drop in tourists and a slide in some stocks. Chinese nationals make up a quarter of all foreign tourists to Japan, according to official figures.\\nEven entertainment and culture is not off the hook.\\nJapanese music events have been cancelled in China, including one where a singer was rushed off stage mid-performance, while film distributors have postponed the release of several Japanese movies.\\nOne of Japan\\'s most famous cultural exports, Pokemon, was also criticised over an event that was due to be held at the Yasukuni Shrine. The temple honours Japan\\'s war dead including some that China considers as war criminals. The event was eventually cancelled.\\nAnd on the social media front, Chinese online nationalists have launched attacks on Takaichi, including sharing AI-generated videos showing pop culture figure Ultraman and anime character Detective Conan fighting the prime minister.\\nBut overall, China has taken actions that have been less provocative compared to previous conflicts with Japan, noted Bonny Lin and Kristi Govella with the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\\n\"Thus far, its economic and military responses have been relatively limited compared to the past, but there is ample room for further escalation,\" they noted in a recent analysis.\\nChina may also be holding back on going too hard on Japan as it is currently \"actively positioning itself as the guardian of the post World War Two order\" and wants to be seen as a responsible power compared to the US, added Ward.\\nObservers agree that if or when tensions calm down, they will likely settle at a higher level than before.\\nBoth sides are less likely to de-escalate this time round, noted Lin and Govella in their analysis. China is a much stronger power now, and \"Taiwan is the core of Chinese core interests, which means that Beijing is more likely to take a hardline position than in past episodes\".\\n\"Beijing is also deeply suspicious of Takaichi and are likely to view her attempts to de-escalate without explicitly retracting her comments as hypocritical or, even worse, strategically deceptive,\" they added.\\nMeanwhile, Japan has a greater appetite to stand firm especially with Takaichi\\'s huge electoral win, which \"she will take this as vindication for her stance on China\", noted Ward.\\nGovella told the BBC that Takaichi would likely use her win as \"political capital\" to advance defence and economic policies that will strengthen Japan\\'s position.\\nTakaichi has pledged to raise Japan\\'s defence-related spending to 2% of the GDP two years ahead of schedule, complete a revision of key security strategies by the end of this year, and launch an economic stimulus package soon.\\nIn turn, China \"sees that Takaichi is a pretty strong leader and the pressure campaign could only make her stronger domestically, [so] they may not intensify their pressure much,\" said Kiyoteru Tsutsui, a Japan expert and director of the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University.\\n\"So this tango will likely continue on for a while.\"\\nThe wildcard could be that US President Donald Trump has so far pledged strong support for Takaichi, issuing an unusual endorsement for her in the run-up to the snap election.\\nBut many expect US-China relations to warm further this year, Tsutsui noted, with several scheduled meetings between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping including the US president\\'s state visit to Beijing in April.\\nAnd compared to previous incidents, the US response to the latest spat \"has been muted so far, which may embolden China\", said Lin and Govella.\\n\"The Japanese are terrified there\\'s going to be some grand bargain between Xi and Trump,\" said Ward.\\nOver the weekend, the US and Japan affirmed their ties on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in a meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi.\\nTakaichi is also due to meet Trump again in March when she visits Washington DC, ahead of his trip to China.\\nAs China keeps piling on the pressure, Tokyo will likely \"double down\" on shouldering more of the defence burden it shares with the US, said Ward, and \"really work more closely with them to make sure that the US doesn\\'t sort of drift off and lose interest in the region\".\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The morning before he died, Dipu Chandra Das left home at first light, stepping out of his tin-sheet house in Bangladesh\\'s Mymensingh city, overlooking a warren of lanes off the highway from Dhaka.\\nThe 28-year-old woke up his father, said goodbye to his wife, cradled his 18-month-old daughter. Then he boarded a bus for the 60km (37-mile) journey to the garment factory where he worked as a junior quality inspector, checking sweaters bound for global high-street brands such as H&M and Next.\\nHis family would not see him again.\\nWarning: Some readers may find the details below disturbing\\nTwenty-four hours later, on 18 December, Das, a Hindu, was dead - lynched and burned by a mob after being accused of blasphemy.\\nAccused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad, he was dragged from his workplace, beaten, hauled more than a kilometre through crowded streets, tied to a tree on a busy highway and set alight before hundreds of onlookers.\\nThe killing sparked global outrage, particularly across the border in India, reviving fears about the safety of minorities since then prime minister Sheikh Hasina was toppled in student-led protests in 2024. About 9% of Bangladesh\\'s 174 million people belong to religious minorities - mostly Hindus. Relations with the Muslim majority have long been marked by periodic tension and insecurity.\\nFifty days on, the outrage has ebbed, but grief hangs over the home Das left behind - a single dark room with a beaten-earth floor and tin roof, where the family has lived for nearly 15 years.\\nIt is a house with little furniture or belongings: a plastic table and chairs, beds, sacks of rice, a teddy bear, clothes hanging from a single rail. A refrigerator and a small television - both bought by Dipu on instalments - stand out, quiet markers of a future he was still trying to build.\\nHis mother, Shefali Rani Das, breaks down as soon as visitors enter.\\n\"Oh Dipu, where is my Dipu?\" she cries, collapsing into a mournful lament.\\nDipu was the eldest son of Rabi Das, a 54-year-old labourer who has spent his life hauling sacks of rice, wheat and vegetables at a nearby market for 400 to 500 taka ($3- $4) a day.\\nYears of hard work have left him weather-beaten and broken. Dipu wanted him to stop.\\n\"Now I am working,\" he would tell his father often. \"You rest.\"\\nDipu would hand over his salary to the family. He talked constantly about building a proper house, one that would lift the family out of mud and tin for good.\\nBorn at home and raised in a mixed Hindu-Muslim neighbourhood shaped by quiet hardship, Dipu was, by all accounts, a private man with few friends. He left college during the pandemic as lockdowns crushed the family\\'s finances.\\nBy 2024, he was working at a sweater factory, sending money home, and returning from his dorm with chocolates for his infant daughter, spending evenings watching cartoons on TV.\\nThe eldest of three sons, his ambition, his mother said, was to see his younger brothers, Apu, 22, and Rithick, 16, \"settled\".\\nDipu was a small cog in Bangladesh\\'s garment export machine, working for the past 14 months at the Pioneer Knitwear factory. The unit employs about 8,500 workers and is one of nine factories in a group with a workforce of 47,000.\\nIts sweaters, stitched on long production lines, retail in shops across the US and Europe. Dipu, earning 13,500 taka ($110; £80) a month, checked stitches and seams on one of the factory\\'s hundred production lines. He was one of 868 Hindu workers there.\\nIt was an ordinary life, lived carefully - a young man trying to pull his family out of poverty.\\nThen came the fateful December evening. A rumour swept through his workplace and outside that he had uttered a \\'katukti\\' - Bengali for an insulting remark - against Prophet Muhammad.\\nWhat happened next, in the hours between the allegation and his death, is now the subject of a police investigation.\\nOn the evening in question, a casual chat about weekend plans among three female co-workers near closing time took an uncomfortable turn when Dipu joined in and allegedly made a remark later deemed offensive to the Prophet, according to Mohammed Abdullah Al-Mamun, the additional superintendent of police in Mymensingh, citing accounts from at least three witnesses.\\nFactory CCTV footage shows Dipu clocking out about 30 minutes after this conversation. He later returned to the floor - footage from two hours later shows him roaming the area, according to Uday Hossain, a senior factory manager.\\nWhy Dipu went back after checking out remains unclear.\\nOutside a mob had begun to collect as word spread that a factory worker had committed blasphemy. (Bangladesh has no formal blasphemy law, but it criminalises acts \"intended to outrage religious feelings\".)\\nAs workers poured out at the end of the day, the rumour travelled fast in a busy neighbourhood. By about 6pm, tension had hardened both inside the factory and on the street.\\n\"What followed went far beyond the law,\" said Al-Mamun.\\nA mob that began as several hundred at the factory gates demanding Dipu be handed over quickly swelled to more than a thousand, drawing in onlookers from nearby areas. CCTV footage shows men trying to force the gates and hurling ropes over them to climb inside.\\nAt around 20.42 local time, Hossain says, the crowd used shovels to prise open a smaller side gate, poured into the factory, and \"carried Dipu away like a wave\".\\nHossain said the factory had alerted police at least 45 minutes earlier. Yet even as industrial police and officers in plain clothes arrived at the site, they were unable to extract him from the mob, he added.\\nPolice, however, offer a slightly different account of how Dipu ended up in the mob\\'s hands.\\nThey say the crowd threatened to break down the gates if he was not handed over. Faced with that ultimatum, factory workers opened the gate and released him, according to Al-Mamun.\\nInvestigators believe Dipu was beaten to death outside the factory before his body was dragged to a nearby highway, tied with a rope to a tree, and set on fire. \"By the time I arrived, he was already dead,\" Al-Mamun said.\\nSo far, 22 people have been arrested in connection with the incident. Half of those held were Dipu\\'s co-workers at the factory, including two managers of the floor where he worked. An imam of a local mosque has also been arrested.\\nMost of the suspects are aged between 22 and 30. Police estimate that around 150 people were directly involved in the attack, with many more present as onlookers, while others are still being sought by police.\\nFew of those arrested, Al-Mamun said, appeared \"particularly religious\".\\n\"Some are students, some are passersby, some are locals. Everyone was beating Dipu, so they beat him too. But we are treating this as a hate crime.\"\\nSince the student uprising of 2024, the scale and nature of attacks on minorities - mainly Hindus - have become a fiercely contested question in Bangladesh.\\nThe outgoing interim government says that between January and December 2025, police records show 645 incidents involving minorities but insists that nearly nine in 10 were not communal.\\nOfficials say that most cases involved ordinary criminality - land disputes, theft, extortion, or personal feuds - that were later framed as religious violence. By its count, only 71 incidents had a clear communal element, including 38 cases of temple vandalism, eight attacks on temples, and one killing.\\nHuman-rights groups paint a darker picture.\\nAin o Salish Kendra (ASK) records 42 incidents of violence against Hindus in 2025, including dozens of attacks on homes and arson, leaving one dead and 15 injured - numbers that broadly overlap with, but are narrower than, the government\\'s tally.\\nThe biggest divergence comes from the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, which says violence spiked dramatically after August 2024.\\nMainly drawing on media reports, the group says it has documented 2,711 attacks on minorities since August 2024 - including at least 92 killings, 133 attacks on temples and 47 cases of land grabbing - figures far higher than official estimates.\\n\"Minorities in Bangladesh have faced attacks by religious extremists for more than half a century. Governments of all stripes share responsibility. Our numbers have steadily shrunk as many have fled or migrated,\" Manindra Kumar Nath of the Council told the BBC.\\nIndia, meanwhile, says independent sources have documented more than 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities - including killings, arson and land grabs - during the interim government\\'s tenure.\\nNobel laureate and outgoing interim government chief Muhammad Yunus has said, \"there\\'s no anti-Hindu violence\", dismissing such reports as \"fake news\" by the Indian media. Separately, he has said the attacks were \"political, not religious\".\\nYet, all is not lost. Dipu\\'s killing sparked protests in Dhaka; his employers have cleared his dues and promised to build the house he dreamed of. The outgoing government has pledged $35,000 toward the new home and additional compensation for his family.\\n\"What happened was barbaric, deplorable and shameful. We want the strictest punishment for those responsible,\" said Badshah Mian, managing director of Pioneer Knitwear. \"If this can happen outside a factory, none of us is safe.\"\\nThat note of solidarity has persisted despite wider tensions.\\nAfter Hasina fled the country in 2024, Hindu minorities - often seen as aligned with her secular Awami League in an Islamic state - were attacked by rivals, even as some young Muslim groups moved to protect Hindu homes and shrines.\\nAnd ahead of the recently concluded election, Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) pledged: \"We want to build a Bangladesh together - the kind of Bangladesh a mother dreams of,\" reaching out to people of all religions.\\nBack at Dipu\\'s home, the night of the killing is recalled in fragments.\\nA phone call around eight in the evening. A visit to the police station. A father stumbling home to deliver news that shattered the household.\\nHis parents had collapsed. For hours, they were unconscious, neighbours later said - revived with water, then saline injections as the house filled with people and cries.\\nNearly two months on, Dipu\\'s mother still breaks down every day. His father has not returned to work. Sleep has vanished. So has appetite, routine, peace.\\n\"Our life has stalled.

       "  'Article': 'Even in good years, mangoes are considered one of the most difficult fruit crops to cultivate.\\nThey depend on a delicate balance of climate, tree physiology, and farming techniques.\\nGetting that balance right is crucial for India, the world\\'s biggest producer of mangoes, where 23 million tonnes of the fruit is harvested every year - almost a fifth of India\\'s total fruit output.\\nBut for many farmers mango cultivation has, in recent years, become more challenging.\\n\"Mango farming has become unpredictable,\" says Upendra Singh, who farms 16 acres of land in Malihabad, in the northwestern state of Uttar Pradesh.\\nHe is the fourth generation of mango farmers in his family, and started work on the farm when he was 12-years-old.\\n\"Seasons no longer follow a pattern. Flowering, fruiting, and harvesting all shift every year because of climate change,\" says Singh, now 62.\\n\"Input costs have gone up, pesticides, labour, irrigation. But yields have gone down. Farmers are spending more money but earning less from mango orchards,\" he adds.\\nAlmost 700 varieties of mango are cultivated across India, with each region having its own dominant variety. So, in northern India the Dasheri is the most common, in Maharashta the Alphonso dominates, and in Bihar and West Bengal the Langra and Malda varieties are most frequently seen.\\nBut few farmers escape the effects of climate change.\\n\"With erratic weather patterns becoming the norm, mango farming is under pressure,\" says Dr Hari Shankar Singh, a scientist at the Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (ICAR).\\n\"Mango is highly temperature-dependent,\" he explains.\\n\"Last year, flowering happened early, strong winds affected fruit development, maturity came too fast, and much of the crop went waste.\\n\"This year, prolonged low temperatures in north India delayed flowering altogether,\" Singh says.\\nTo help make farmers more resilient, researchers are developing new varieties of mango which can tolerate wider temperature ranges and resist pests and disease.\\nBut it\\'s slow work. Mango trees take between five and ten years to flower after breeding.\\nIn addition mango trees have another unhelpful biological quirk: they are heterozygous, meaning offspring rarely resemble their parents.\\n\"Mango breeding is a multi-decade scientific commitment, not a quick innovation,\" says Hari Singh.\\nGenetic science is helping speed up that process. ICAR led a group of scientists who announced the sequencing of the mango genome in 2016.\\nTheir work focused on the Alphonso mango.\\n\"Mango genome sequencing allows researchers to identify genes linked to fruit colour, aroma, sweetness, flowering behaviour, climate resilience and disease tolerance,\" says Hari Singh.\\nThat has \"significantly\" reduced the 10 to 20 years traditionally needed for mango breeding he says.\\nFarmers are ready to embrace innovation when it comes along.\\nOn his farm, Upendra Singh has planted a new variety of mango, the coloured mango, in greater density than his old orchard.\\n\"The biggest advantage of coloured varieties is they give fruit every year. Traditional varieties like Dasheri and Langda often have off years,\" Upendra Singh says.\\nModern cultivation techniques also help.\\n\"Scientific pruning, canopy management, and growth regulators are being used to control tree size, induce flowering, and manage early or uniform harvests,\" he says.\\nICAR encourages farmers to use several techniques to improve their crops.\\n\"Bagging\" is a simple innovation, where each fruit is enclosed in a breathable protective cover in its early development.\\n\"This method creates a controlled micro-environment around the fruit, reducing exposure to insect infestation, fungal pathogens, mechanical damage, and excessive solar radiation,\" says Dr T Damodaran, the Director of ICAR.\\nHis organisation also recommends another technique, called \"girdling\". The involves making a narrow, controlled ring cut on selected branches. The resultant stress on the tree redirects the tree\\'s energy towards flowering and fruit development.\\nOlder orchards can also be rejuvenated, by cutting the trees down to between 14 and 18 feet in height.\\n\"Once rejuvenated, flowering improves dramatically, fruit size increases, and most fruits become A-grade instead of B or C grade,\" says Hari Singh.\\nFor Neeti Goel, mango farming started as a hobby. Ten years ago she planted a few trees out of curiosity.\\nNow she has more than 1,100 trees across 27 acres in Alibhaug, in the central state of Maharashtra.\\n\"Instead of traditional trial-and-error farming, we use scientific mango cultivation,\" she says.\\n\"We start every season with soil and leaf analysis. Without that, fertiliser application is guesswork, not farming. Micronutrients like boron and zinc play a decisive role in fruit, so ignoring them directly impacts yield.\"\\nHer next step could be to move the trees inside.\\n\"We have stared building greenhouses so that the temperature can be controlled. If one does not adopt innovative methods we are doomed.\"\\nSaravanan Achari also believes that covering the trees is the way forward.\\nAchari is the founder of Berrydale Foods, which exports Indian mangoes to 13 countries.\\nPests are one of is main concerns.\\n\"Export markets demand zero tolerance on pests. Even if inspectors find a single fruit fly, the entire consignment is discarded, leading to huge losses,\" he says.\\nClimate change is making it more difficult to manage pests. Fruit flies appear after rainfall, but climate change is making that rainfall more unpredictable, so pests are appearing at different times of the year.\\n\"Climate change has become the single biggest risk factor for mango exports today,\" says Achari.\\nSo Achari is experimenting with greenhouses on Berrydale\\'s farm.\\n\"Countries like Japan and Israel are already using greenhouse and protected cultivation because they face similar climate challenges. Indian farmers will also have to move in this direction if we want consistent quality and reliable exports.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'A new artificial intelligence (AI) model developed by the Chinese company behind TikTok rocked Hollywood this week - not just because of what it can do, but what it could mean for creative industries.\\nCreated by tech giant ByteDance, Seedance 2.0 can generate cinema-quality video, complete with sound effects and dialogue, from just a few written prompts.\\nMany of the clips said to have been made using Seedance, and featuring popular characters like Spider-Man and Deadpool, went viral.\\nMajor studios like Disney and Paramount quickly accused ByteDance of copyright infringement but concerns about the technology run deeper than legal issues.\\nSeedance was launched to little fanfare in June 2025 but it is the second version that came eight months later that has caused a major stir.\\n\"For the first time, I\\'m not thinking that this looks good for AI. Instead, I\\'m thinking that this looks straight out of a real production pipeline,\" says Jan-Willem Blom from creative studio Videostate.\\nWestern AI video models have made progress in processing user instructions to make stunning images, he adds, but Seedance seems to have tied everything together.\\nLike other AI tools - Midjourney and OpenAI\\'s Sora - Seedance can create videos from short text prompts. In some cases just one prompt seems to be producing high-quality videos.\\nIt is particularly impressive because it combines text, visuals and audio in a single system, AI ethics researcher Margaret Mitchell says.\\nSeedance\\'s impact is being measured by an unlikely benchmark: how well it generates a clip of Will Smith eating spaghetti.\\nNot only can Seedance create a remarkably life-like version of the star tucking into a plate of pasta, it has also spawned viral videos of Smith battling a spaghetti monster - and it looks and feels like a big-budget movie.\\nMany industry experts and filmmakers believe Seedance is a new chapter in the development of video-generating technology.\\nThe complex action sequences it is producing look more realistic than its competitors, says David Kwok, who runs a Singapore-based animation studio called Tiny Island Productions.\\n\"It almost feels like having a cinematographer or director of photography specialising in action films assisting you.\"\\nSeedance has run into trouble over copyright issues, a growing challenge in the age of AI.\\nExperts warn that AI companies are prioritising technology over people as they make more powerful tools and use data without paying for it.\\nMajor Hollywood groups have cried foul over Seedance\\'s use of copyrighted characters like Spider Man and Darth Vader. Disney and Paramount issued cease-and-desist letters demanding that Seedance stop using their content. Japan is also investigating ByteDance for alleged copyright violations, after AI videos of popular anime characters went viral.\\nByteDance has said it was taking steps to \"strengthen current safeguards\". This is not unique to the Chinese firm.\\nIn 2023, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging they used its articles without permission to train their AI models. Reddit sued Perplexity last year, claiming the AI firm had illegally scraped user posts. Disney raised similar concerns with Google.\\nClearly labelling content to prevent deception and building public trust in AI is far more important than \"cooler-looking\" videos, Mitchell says.\\nAnd that\\'s why developers must build systems that manage licensing and payments, and provide clear mechanisms for people to contest misuse, she adds.\\nDisney, for instance, signed a $1bn (£730m) deal with OpenAI\\'s Sora so it could use characters from Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel.\\nSeedance\\'s developers were likely to have been aware of potential copyright issues around the use of Western IP and took a risk anyway, says Shaanan Cohney, a computing researcher at the University of Melbourne.\\n\"There\\'s plenty of leeway to bend the rules strategically, to flout the rules for a while and get marketing clout,\" he adds.\\nMeanwhile, for small firms, Seedance is too useful to ignore.\\nKwok, from Singapore\\'s Tiny Island Productions, says AI of this quality will allow companies like his to create films that would cost far more than they can otherwise afford.\\nHe gave the example of Asia\\'s booming short‑form videos and micro‑dramas that typically run on small budgets - roughly $140,000 for as many as 80 episodes under two minutes each.\\nThese productions have been sticking to romance or family drama to keep costs down as they need fewer visual effects. But now AI can \"elevate low-budget productions into more ambitious genres such as sci-fi, period drama and, now, action\", Kwok says.\\nSeedance once again puts Chinese tech in the spotlight.\\n\"It signals that Chinese models are at the very least matching at the frontier of what is available,\" Cohney says. \"If ByteDance can produce this seemingly out of nowhere, what other kinds of models do Chinese companies have in store?\"\\nLast year DeepSeek, another Chinese AI model, sent shockwaves around the world with its low-cost large language model. It quickly overtook ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on Apple\\'s US store.\\nIn the year since Beijing has put AI and robotics at the core of its economic strategy, investing heavily in advanced computer chip production, automation and generative AI as it bids for a technological edge over the US.\\nWhile Seedance 2.0 was making headlines, other big Chinese firms had lower-profile rollouts of their new generative AI tools ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\\nThe Spring Festival is increasingly becoming an \"AI holiday,\" with firms timing launches for a period when millions of people are at home and experimenting with new apps, China analyst Bill Bishop wrote in his newsletter.\\nHe predicts 2026 could mark a turning point for mass AI adoption in China - not just chatbots, but also AI agents handling transactions, coding tools incorporated in everyday work, and video creators routinely using AI.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'South Korea\\'s ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been jailed for life for leading an insurrection, a little over a year after he tried imposing military rule.\\nHis short-lived decree threw South Korea into turmoil, deeply divided the country and handed the opposition a landslide victory six months later.\\nYoon, 65, has already been handed a five-year jail term for abuse of power and obstructing his own arrest. He also faces two more trials. But today\\'s verdict involved the most serious charge - leading an insurrection.\\nInsurrection refers to the act of revolting against or overthrowing an established government or authority of a nation state, often by violent means.\\nUnder South Korea\\'s constitution, sitting presidents are immune from criminal prosecution, except when the charge is insurrection or treason.\\nOn Thursday, a Seoul court ruled that Yoon\\'s actions on 3 December 2024 – in particular, deploying military troops to seal off the National Assembly and ordering the arrest of politicians – were acts to subvert the constitution.\\n\"The court finds that the intention was to paralyse the assembly for a considerable period,\" presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon said while convicting Yoon as the \"chief insurrectionist\".\\nProsecutors sought the death penalty, describing Yoon as \"unrepentant\". They argued that a lesser sentence may not send a strong enough message to those who may wish to attempt something similar.\\nYoon had earlier claimed he declared martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea. But in the weeks that followed it became apparent that he was driven by other challenges: he had become a lame-duck president facing plummeting ratings, scandals and an opposition that was threatening to investigate his wife over corruption allegations.\\nBut even during his trial, he continued defending the martial law order, calling it \"a measure to protect the freedom and sovereignty of the people and to preserve the nation and its constitution\".\\nThis isn\\'t the first time a former South Korean leader has been convicted for his role in an insurrection.\\nChun Doo-hwan, who ruled South Korea in the 1980s as a military dictator, was sentenced to death for leading an insurrection, though this was later reduced to life imprisonment. His ally and successor Roh Tae-woo was handed a lengthy jail term for his part in it. Both were eventually pardoned.\\nProsecutors have argued, however, that Yoon\\'s 2024 martial law attempt \"tarnished the nation\\'s dignity far more severely\" than the military coup Chun and Roh staged in 1979.\\nLaw professor Lim Ji-bong told the BBC ahead of the verdict that he expects the judge tohand down a life sentence to \"avoid making Yoon a martyr\". A death sentence carries political risk as it may further alienate Yoon\\'s supporters and deepen chaos in the country, he said.\\nEven if he had been handed the death sentence, it would, in effect, be life imprisonment because South Korea has not executed anyone on death row since December 1997.\\nUS-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee believes Yoon will ultimately be pardoned, as Chun and Roh were.\\n\"It\\'s a customary thing about Korean politics,\" Lee said. \"Whatever the sentence, it\\'s just a symbolic acknowledgement of how severe the crime is.\"\\nIn January, Yoon was found guilty of obstruction of justice by evading arrest; abuse of power by not convening a cabinet meeting before his martial law declaration; and falsifying official documents.\\nProsecutors accused him of using state institutions \"for personal purposes\" to conceal wrongdoing and undermine constitutional checks and balances.\\nIn January last year, it took some 3,000 police officers, over two attempts, to finally take Yoon into custody for questioning over the insurrection charge.\\nYoon had mobilised a large group of security officers who formed a human wall inside his residence to block the arrest - a move that a special prosecutor investigating the charge said was unprecedented.\\nYoon, meanwhile, argued the Corruption Investigation Office that attempted to arrest him lacked jurisdiction to investigate insurrection charges.\\nThe chaos surrounding the arrest, and the earlier failed attempt, \"demonstrated apparent lawlessness by Yoon, [his] conservative party, and South Korea\\'s domestic security institutions\", said Mason Richey, an associate professor at Seoul\\'s Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.\\n\"The obstruction of justice trial is a way to ensure accountability for these,\" he said.\\nProsecutors have also alleged that Yoon tried to provoke North Korea into attacking the South so as to justify his martial law declaration.\\nIn putting forward this charge, the prosecution relied on evidence found on former military intelligence chief Yeo In-hyung\\'s phone that contained words suggesting potential provocations. They also cited a memo which appeared to push for a move to \"create an unstable situation or seize an arising opportunity\".\\nThis trial, which opened in January, will look at whether Yoon ordered drone flights into the North to induce military conflict between the Koreas, among other things.\\nYeo and Yoon\\'s former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun have also been indicted on the same charge.\\nYoon has also been accused of perjury, for when he testified during former prime minister Han Duck-soo\\'s trial last year on charges of aiding the insurrection.\\nProsecutors allege that Yoon falsely testified by claiming he had long planned to hold a cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Investigators said Yoon had no such plan and only convened a meeting at Han\\'s urging.\\nApart from charges related to his martial law attempt, Yoon has also been indicted in a series of other cases.\\nHe is among 33 people charged for allegedly obstructing an investigation into the death of a young marine officer in 2023, and for aiding the suspect in this case.\\nHe has also been charged for meddling in the 2022 presidential elections and making false statements during his campaign.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'It was an unexpected, late-night press conference which would set in motion the start of Yoon Suk Yeol\\'s fall from presidential palace to prison cell.\\nThe then-South Korean president appeared on television to declare martial law in December 2024, ordering the army to take control.\\nWithin hours, it had been reversed by parliament, citizens and politicians alike rallying to defend the young democracy.\\nYoon, meanwhile, found himself arrested, impeached and indicted for various charges in connection with the botched order.\\nJust over a year later, he has now been sentenced to life in prison. It is the 65-year-old politician\\'s second conviction - he was jailed for five years in January for abusing power, obstructing justice and falsifying documents.\\nHis martial law order and ensuing legal troubles have divided South Korea, with large crowds gathering against him as well as in support of him. The same was true as he was sentenced in February, when pro-Yoon crowds rallied outside the court in Seoul.\\nInfluential right-wing YouTubers who support Yoon have long peddled conspiracy theories of stolen elections and anti-state Communist forces. And the former president himself channelled these into mainstream discourse, even citing unfounded claims of anti-state forces in the opposition to justify the martial law order.\\nHe had said the opposition was \"trying to overthrow free democracy\".\\nBut it soon became clear that he was motivated by his own political troubles.\\nPlagued by personal scandals and mounting pressure from the opposition, Yoon\\'s popularity had been falling since he took office in 2022.\\nYoon was a relative newcomer to politics when he won the presidency. He had risen to national prominence for prosecuting the corruption case against disgraced former President Park Geun-hye in 2016.\\nIn 2022, the political novice narrowly beat his liberal opponent Lee Jae Myung by less than 1% of the vote - the closest result the country has seen since direct elections started to be held in 1987.\\nAt a time when South Korean society was grappling with widening divisions over gender issues, Yoon appealed to young male voters by running on an anti-feminism platform.\\nPeople had “high hopes” for Yoon when he was elected, said Don S Lee, associate professor of public administration at Sungkyunkwan University. “Those who voted for Yoon believed that a new government under Yoon will pursue such values as principle, transparency and efficiency.”\\nYoon has also championed a hawkish stance on North Korea. The communist state was cited by Yoon when he tried to impose martial law.\\nHe said he needed to protect against North Korean forces and “eliminate anti-state elements”, even though it was apparent from the outset that his announcement was less about the threat from the North and more about his domestic woes.\\nYoon is known for gaffes, which haven’t helped his ratings. During his 2022 campaign he had to walk back a comment that authoritarian president Chun Doo-hwan, who declared martial law and was responsible for massacring protestors in 1980, had been \"good at politics\".\\nLater that year he was forced to deny insulting the US Congress in remarks made after meeting US President Joe Biden in New York.\\nHe was caught on a hot mic and seen on camera seemingly calling US lawmakers a Korean word that can be translated as \"idiots\" or something much stronger. The footage quickly went viral in South Korea.\\nStill, Yoon has had some success in foreign policy, notably improving ties in his country\\'s historically fraught relationship with Japan.\\nMuch of the scandal during Yoon\\'s presidency centred around his wife Kim Keon Hee, who was accused of corruption and influence peddling, most notably allegedly accepting luxury bags from a pastor.\\nIn November, Yoon apologised on behalf of his wife while rejecting calls for an investigation into her activities - a move that did little to help his wobbly approval ratings.\\nYoon was relegated to a lame-duck president after the opposition Democratic Party won the parliamentary election by a landslide April 2024. The result was widely seen as a vote of no confidence on Yoon\\'s time in office.\\nHe also faced increasing pressure from his political opponents. In the lead-up to the martial law declaration, the opposition slashed the budget proposed by Yoon\\'s ruling party and moved to impeach cabinet members for failing to investigate the first lady.\\nWith his back against the wall, Yoon went for the nuclear option - a move that few, if any, could have predicted.\\nMany had worried about a political crisis \"because of the confrontation between the president and the opposition-controlled National Assembly\", said Celeste Arrington, director of The George Washington University Institute for Korean Studies. \"Though few predicted such an extreme move as declaring martial law.\"\\nIt was \"legal overreach and a political miscalculation\", said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\\n\"He sounded like a politician under siege,\" Dr Easley told the BBC.\\n\"With extremely low public support and without strong backing within his own party and administration, the president should have known how difficult it would be to implement his late-night decree.\"\\nCrisis engulfed Yoon\\'s government in the wake of his martial law order. He was impeached, indicted over a series of charges in connection to it, and finally removed from office in April 2025.\\nHis party paid the price too. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party\\'s Lee Jae-myung won a landslide in the presidential election in June.\\nTop officials from his cabinet have since been either charged or convicted. Han Duck-soo, the prime minister who became acting president after Yoon was removed, has been jailed for 23 years for his part in the attempt, while former interior minister Lee Sang-min was handed a seven-year term.\\nIn both cases, the courts recognised the declaration of martial law as an act of insurrection.\\nBut even as the saga draws to a close, South Korea is reeling from the divisions that erupted in December 2024.\\nAlthough Yoon\\'s People Power Party is in disarray, he still has a vocal support base, which some may argue has even strengthened because of his downfall.\\nHis supporters, mainly young male voters and the elderly, often echo strong right-wing narratives and conspiracy theories, including that Yoon\\'s party was a victim of election fraud. They also believe his declaration of martial law was necessary to protect the country.\\nThroughout the chaos, Yoon has projected what his critics see as defiance – or, as his supporters see it, determination.\\nWhile on trial for insurrection, Yoon defended his martial law order, calling it \"a measure to protect the freedom and sovereignty of the people and to preserve the nation and its constitution.\"\\nHe still faces two trials in connection with the failed martial law bid, and four others over corruption charges.\\n'},\n",

The settlement is largely inhabited by washermen and their families, many of whom live and work there.\\nTucked within the maze is a small learning centre offering free lessons in basic math and language skills, helping their children get a formal education for the first time, or return to it after dropping out from school.\\nThe centre is run by a non-profit founded by Rouble Nagi, a 45-year-old artist who for three decades has worked to bring education to some of the city\\'s most marginalised communities.\\nEarlier this month, Nagi received the Global Teacher Prize, a $1m award launched by the Varkey Foundation in collaboration with Unesco to recognise teachers who have made exceptional contributions to the profession.\\nNagi was selected from among 5,000 nominations and applications from 139 countries, according to the Global Teacher Prize website.\\nIt said that Nagi, through her non-profit organisation - the Rouble Nagi Art Foundation (RNAF) - had established \"more than 800 learning centres across India in over 100 underserved communities and villages\".\\nNagi said her inspiration to take learning to the less-fortunate came about unexpectedly, about three decades ago, when a boy walked into one of her art workshops in Mumbai. She learnt that the child lived in a slum and could not afford to go to school.\\nNagi says that the conversation motivated her to visit the boy\\'s slum community and she offered to spruce up the locality by decorating the walls with murals.\\n\"Children began to gather where we were painting. So, I asked them if they\\'d like to hear a story. They all said \\'yes\\',\" Nagi recounts.\\nShe said that\\'s when she realised that children in poor communities wanted to learn and that she could spark their interest in education through art.\\nOver the years, Nagi and her team have set up learning centres in several cities across India, where teachers are encouraged to use art-based learning to simplify concepts. Volunteers are roped in to offer skill-based lessons and donations help children access books, bags and other school supplies.\\nNagi explains that not all of the centres are brick-and-mortar classrooms. Sometimes, classes are held in an open area in a slum with students seated on mats and carpets.\\n\"Learning can happen anywhere. You just have to make it interesting,\" Nagi says.\\nBut running these centres is also challenging. Nagi says many of the children come from dysfunctional families and her teachers often have to double-up as their counsellors and protectors.\\n\"If a child doesn\\'t show up at one of our centres for a week, a volunteer visits their home to check on them,\" Nagi explains.\\nShe adds that she also holds regular sessions with parents to keep them interested in their child\\'s learning. This has helped many of her students complete their schooling and even pursue a college education after leaving the centre, she says.\\nOne former student, Mayur, now runs his own art classes and a small printing business. At weekends, he volunteers with Nagi\\'s foundation, hoping to give other children from the community the same opportunities he received.\\n\"When you work in areas like these [slums], you have to build relationships not just with the students but the entire community. Whether that\\'s through monetary help, supplying provisions in difficult times or offering a listening ear to someone who\\'s overwhelmed. If we earn the trust and support of the community, we can continue our good work,\" Nagi explains.\\nShe says she is also passionate about her foundation\\'s \\'Misaal\\' (meaning \\'an example\\') project - which focuses on converting slums into \"open-air classrooms\" by painting educational murals on walls on topics ranging from science and hygiene to environmental awareness and social responsibility.\\nNagi says these murals spark curiosity among residents and, in the long run, can also help bring about a change in people\\'s behaviour and attitudes.\\nWith the prize money, Nagi hopes to take her foundation\\'s initiatives to more places in India, beginning with the federally-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir, where she grew up and now wants to build a skill-cum-learning centre, complete with computers.\\nBack in Colaba, huge murals and inspirational quotes cover the walls of shanties. The walls of the learning centre too are painted in bright colours and feature subjects ranging from plants to the animal kingdom.\\nSeven-year-old Khushi, a student at the centre, says she enjoys coming to \"school\" and dreams of becoming a teacher.

Both of his parents previously served as leaders of Bangladesh.\\nYet it has been far from a smooth path to the top for Rahman, whose career has been dogged by allegations of nepotism and corruption by political rivals, as well as a long period of exile and his father\\'s assassination when Rahman was a teenager.\\nHis eventual ascent to chairman of the BNP came just weeks before Bangladesh headed to the polls, following the death of his mother, the country\\'s first female prime minister Khaleda Zia.\\n\"Peace, law and order must be maintained at any cost ...

Her first had run from 1991 to 1996. His father, Ziaur Rahman, a military ruler turned president, had been killed in a military coup in 1981. He was a leading figure in Bangladesh\\'s struggle for independence and founded the BNP in 1978.\\nIn 2002, Rahman took his first significant steps in his parents\\' footprints, when it was announced that he had been promoted to a senior position within the party.\\nAt the time, the opposition described his rise as brazen nepotism. He would go on to acquire a reputation for being a \"hatchet man\" who enforced party discipline.\\nRahman has also been accused in the past of using his power to gain personal advantages but has always denied the corruption allegations against him. Some of his supporters believe he was used as a political scapegoat by his opponents.\\nHe was arrested on corruption charges in 2007 during a military-backed caretaker government and said he was tortured while awaiting trial. He spent 18 months in prison before being released and then left the country for London.\\nReports at the time suggested that he had promised to leave politics in order to be allowed to leave Bangladesh.\\nRahman would not return to his home country for another 17 years.\\nYet despite living abroad, Rahman continued to shape BNP strategy and policies and had been the party\\'s acting chairman since his mother was sentenced to prison in 2018.\\nHe too was subject to various criminal investigations while Sheikh Hasina, toppled by mass protests in 2004, was in power and he was sentenced in absentia in numerous cases, including for his role in a deadly grenade attack on a political rally in 2004. He was later cleared of all charges.\\nHe finally returned to Bangladesh on 25 December 2025. Five days later, his mother died.\\nOn 9 January, he officially became the BNP\\'s leader. Analysts say that his rise to leadership in the BNP was inevitable.\\nAccusations of nepotism once again reared their heads - something former BNP commerce minister Amir Khasru shrugged off.\\n\"Whether you come from a dynasty or not is irrelevant,\" he told the BBC, arguing that the BNP\\'s activities had been so stifled by the Hasina regime that the party had been unable to elect a new leader outside of the Zia family.\\nOthers say the true test will be how Rahman leads his party and the country into the future.\\n\"He [Rahman] has seen the dark corners of politics, as well as experienced the politics of conflict and revenge in this country. Whether he can use that political wisdom to move from being a party leader to becoming a leader of the country in the future remains to be seen,\" political analyst Mohiuddin Ahmed told the BBC.\\nWith additional reporting by Rakib Hasnat and Azadeh Moshiri\\n'},\n",

By Monday afternoon, social media was flooded with complaints from founders, exhibitors and delegates who said security sweeps and last-minute closures left them stranded outside exhibition halls.\\nMaitreya Wagh, co-founder of voice AI start-up Bolna, wrote on X that he was unable to access his company\\'s booth after gates were closed. Punit Jain, founder of tech platform Reskill, described \"7 AM queues\" followed by hours of waiting and a \"full evacuation\" before the prime minister\\'s arrival.\\nWhy India\\'s AI summit is key to its future in tech\\nThe tech bros might show more humility in Delhi – but will they make AI any safer?\\nReuters reported that some speakers were still awaiting confirmation of their session timings, adding to concerns over mismanagement.\\nDhananjay Yadav, founder of wearable AI start-up NeoSapiens, alleged that products from his company\\'s stall were stolen at the venue. Writing on X, he said the firm had spent heavily on travel, accommodation and exhibition space, \"only to see our wearables disappear inside a high-security zone\".\\nSeveral attendees also complained about payment arrangements at food stalls inside the venue, saying food counters were accepting only cash and not digital payments, adding to the inconvenience, particularly for international visitors.\\nSoumya Sharma, founder of healthcare-focused Livo AI, said several discussions were held behind closed doors and that security shut down sessions because of overcrowding, preventing many delegates from taking part.\\nThe closures, he suggested, undercut the summit\\'s ambition to showcase India\\'s AI ecosystem to a global audience.\\nWhile he said he attended some \"excellent sessions\", Sharma added that operational lapses risked overshadowing the substance of the event. \"Unless we get the basics right, we cannot claim to be utilising AI to its fullest,\" he wrote on X. \"AI is only part of the system. We must solve basic on-ground issues first.\"\\nThe BBC has reached out to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for a comment on these specifics.\\nThe poor organisation of the event was acknowledged in a press conference on Tuesday by Minister Vaishnaw, who said \"a war-room\" had been set up at the summit to address any issues reported to them.\\n\"About 70,000 people have attended the summit and we can say the organisation is very slow,\" he said. \"Whatever feedback you have, please share with us. We are working very hard to make this experience enjoyable for everyone,\" he added.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'When the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) swept to a landslide in the general elections on Friday, Delhi responded with studied warmth.\\nIn a message posted in Bengali, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated BNP leader Tarique Rahman, the 60-year-old dynast, on a \"decisive victory\". He pledged India\\'s support for a \"democratic, progressive and inclusive\" neighbour. He added that he looked forward to working closely to strengthen \"our multifaceted relationship\".\\nThe tone was forward-looking - and careful. Since Sheikh Hasina fled to India after the Gen Z-led July 2024 uprising, ties between the neighbours have frayed, with mistrust hardening on both sides. Hasina\\'s Awami League - the country\\'s oldest party - was barred from contesting the election.\\nMany Bangladeshis fault Delhi for backing an increasingly authoritarian Hasina - a grievance layered atop older complaints over border killings, water disputes, trade curbs and incendiary rhetoric. Visa services are largely suspended, cross-border trains and buses halted, and flights between Dhaka and Delhi sharply reduced.\\nFor Delhi, the question is not whether to engage a BNP government - but how: securing its red lines on insurgency and extremism while cooling rhetoric that has turned Bangladesh into a domestic political talking-point.\\nA reset is possible, say analysts. But it will require restraint - and reciprocity.\\n\"The BNP, the most politically experienced and moderate of the parties in the fray, is India\\'s safest bet moving forward. The question remains: how will Rahman govern the country? He is clearly seeking to stabilise India-Bangladesh ties. But this is easier said than done,\" says Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London.\\nFor Delhi, the BNP is not an unknown entity.\\nWhen the party - under Rahman\\'s mother Khaleda Zia - returned to power in 2001 in coalition with the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, ties with India cooled quickly. The BNP-Jamaat years were marked by turbulence and deep mutual mistrust.\\nDespite early courtesies - India\\'s then national security adviser Brajesh Mishra was the first foreign dignitary to congratulate Khaleda Zia - trust proved thin. The apparent ease with which the BNP maintained relations with Washington, Beijing and Islamabad fed Delhi\\'s suspicion that Dhaka was drifting strategically.\\nTwo Indian red lines were soon tested: curbing support for north-eastern insurgents and protecting Hindu minorities.\\nPost-election attacks on Hindus in districts such as Bhola and Jessore alarmed Delhi. More damaging was the April 2004 seizure of 10 truckloads of weapons in Chittagong - the largest arms haul in Bangladesh\\'s history - allegedly destined for Indian rebel groups. Economic ties fared little better. A proposed $3bn investment by Tata Group stalled over gas pricing and collapsed in 2008.\\nTies kept deteriorating. In 2014, Zia - then in opposition - cancelled a scheduled meeting with then Indian president Pranab Mukherjee, citing security concerns, in what was widely seen as a snub to Delhi.\\nThat uneasy history helps explain why India later invested so heavily in Sheikh Hasina.\\nIn her 15 years in power, Hasina delivered what Delhi prizes most in its neighbourhood: security co-operation against insurgents, improved connectivity and a government broadly aligned with India rather than China - a partnership as strategically valuable as it was politically costly.\\nNow living in exile in Delhi, she faces a death sentence in absentia over the 2024 security crackdown - violence in which the UN says about 1,400 people were killed, most by security forces. India\\'s refusal to extradite her has further complicated an already fraught reset with Dhaka.\\nLast month, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar travelled to Dhaka for Zia\\'s funeral and used the occasion to meet Rahman. At a recent rally, the BNP leader declared: \"Not Dilli, not Pindi - Bangladesh before everything,\" signalling independence from Delhi and Pakistan\\'s military headquarters in Rawalpindi.\\nPakistan - India\\'s nuclear-armed arch rival that was defeated in 1971 to secure Bangladesh\\'s independence - remains a central, if sensitive, factor in the equation.\\nAfter Hasina\\'s fall, Dhaka wasted little time in mending fences with Islamabad. A direct Dhaka-Karachi flight resumed last month after a 14-year hiatus. Earlier, there was a first visit by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years. Senior military officials have exchanged trips, security co-operation is back on the table, and trade climbed 27% in 2024-25.\\nThe optics are unmistakable: a once-frosty relationship has thawed.\\n\"What concerns us is not that Bangladesh has ties with Pakistan - as a sovereign country, it is entitled to,\" Smruti Pattanaik of the Delhi-based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, told the BBC. \"What was unusual was the near absence of engagement during Hasina\\'s tenure. The pendulum had swung too far in one direction; now it risks swinging too far in the other.\"\\nHasina\\'s continued exile is possibly the other, more serious irritant - in any reset.\\n\"The BNP will have to reckon with the reality that Hasina is unlikely to be repatriated. At the same time, the opposition parties [in Dhaka] will keep up the pressure on the government to press India for her return - it\\'s one of the few levers they have to challenge the BNP on foreign policy,\" says Pattanaik.\\nIt is not going to be easy.\\nThousands of Awami League rank-and-file members have reportedly crossed into India after the 2024 July uprising.\\n\"If Delhi seeks to rehabilitate the Awami League from its soil, it will be fraught - Hasina\\'s pre-election press conferences [from exile] were baffling. Unless she signals contrition or steps aside to allow a leadership transition, her continued presence risks complicating ties,\" says Sreeradha Datta, a professor of international affairs at the OP Jindal Global University.\\nThen there is the cross-border rhetoric - inflammatory commentary from Indian politicians and television studios that has fed a wider belief in Bangladesh that Delhi sees it less as a sovereign equal than as a pliant backyard.\\nAs Paliwal notes, the \"new normal\" will hinge on whether Dhaka\\'s new leadership can contain anti-India sentiment - and whether Delhi can dial down its own charged messaging, seen recently in moves such as barring a Bangladeshi cricketer from the Indian Premier League.\\n\"If they fail - wittingly or unwittingly - then the situation will remain in the \\'managed rivalry\\' bucket,\" he says.\\nTo be sure, security co-operation remains the ballast in an otherwise choppy relationship.\\nIndia and Bangladesh conduct annual military exercises, co-ordinated naval patrols, annual defence dialogues and operate a $500m Indian line of credit for defence purchases.\\n\"I don\\'t think the BNP will roll back that co-operation. This is a new leader, a different coalition - and a party returning after 17 years,\" says Pattanaik.\\nFor all the turbulence, geography and economics bind the two: a 4,096km (2,545-mile) border, deep security and cultural links. Bangladesh is India\\'s biggest trading partner in South Asia, and India has become Bangladesh\\'s largest export market in Asia.\\nEstrangement is untenable - but the frayed ties still demand a reset.\\n\"India\\'s past relationship with the BNP is complex and marked by mistrust more than understanding,\" says Paliwal. \"But given the geopolitical circumstances today, the fact that Rahman has shown political maturity to not let the past become an enemy of the future, and that Delhi is open to pragmatic engagement are promising signs.\"\\nThe question is who moves first.\\n\"India should take the initiative as the big neighbour. India should do the outreach. Bangladesh has held a robust election; now engage, see where we can help. I\\'m hopeful the BNP has learnt the lessons of the past,\" says Datta.\\nIn other words, the reset may depend less on rhetoric and more on whether the bigger neighbour chooses confidence over caution.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Ni hao, we\\'re all Chinese now.\\nOr at least that\\'s what they claim on TikTok, where a trend called \"Chinamaxxing\" has taken off in the West.\\nChinese wellness practices, once associated with the tacky and geriatric, have suddenly found themselves in vogue, largely among Americans.\\nFrom warm apple-boiled water to indoor slippers and longevity exercises, people are sharing videos of themselves \"learning to be Chinese\". Many come with the Fight Club-inspired caption \"you met me at a very Chinese time in my life\", or the hashtag #newlychinese.\\nAs Donald Trump shakes up the world order, the Chinese Communist Party has welcomed this boost to the country\\'s image.\\nChinamaxxing is certainly adding more gloss to the recent flourish of Chinese soft power. Over the past year we\\'ve seen the world clamour for Labubu dolls, wait in line at brand new stores to buy Mixue bubble tea and Luckin coffee, and scroll through their friends\\' holiday feeds in the \"cyberpunk city\" of Chongqing.\\nSome say Chinamaxxing stems from young Americans\\' disenchantment with their own country, although it\\'s unclear how much that is really driving the trend.\\nBut like so many internet trends, this one hardly paints the full picture. It\\'s a celebration of memes and fleeting moments that make up just one slice of Chinese life. Beyond that are young people who, like their American counterparts, are also worried about their future in a sluggish economy and a fast-changing world.\\nSome Chinese youth may find it strange that parts of their culture - long seen as \"uncool\" in the Western imagination - are now the object of fascination. Some may find it offensive that Westerners on TikTok are facetiously claiming they\\'ve been \"diagnosed as Chinese\".\\nBut others say Chinamaxxing strikes a different note from derogatory jokes like \"bing chilling\" - where the punchline is ex-wrestler John Cena\\'s stilted Mandarin pronunciation - or the \"social credit\" meme that mocks the Chinese government\\'s restrictions on personal freedoms.\\nThis time, Chinese people are in on the joke - not the butt of it.\\nOne of the most influential figures behind the Chinamaxxing meme is Sherry Zhu, a Chinese-American TikTok content creator who regularly shares traditional wellness tips with her \"Chinese baddies\".\\n\"Tomorrow you\\'re turning Chinese,\" she tells her 740,000 TikTok followers. \"And I know that sounds intimidating, but there is no point in fighting it now.\"\\nFew could have seen this coming.\\nIt was not that long ago when the Covid pandemic sparked a wave of Sinophobia. Chinese diaspora spoke of racism and how people were avoiding the community and their businesses.\\nThen a stunned world watched Beijing put its cities into hellish lockdowns. Reports emerged of residents running out of food and pleading for help from inside their sealed-off neighbourhoods. The restrictions ended only in early 2023 after rare protests. By then expats had left China in droves, many of them saying too much had changed.\\nThere was also an exodus from Hong Kong, where Beijing\\'s control was reshaping the city. This, along with China\\'s growing power and assertiveness, strained the relationship with the West, even as the world\\'s reliance on the Chinese economy became clear.\\nMeanwhile, China\\'s investments in tech, infrastructure and exports began to pay off - and became more visible as it reopened post pandemic, relaxing visa rules to bring back tourists.\\nIt was hard to miss: glitzy skyscrapers, a sprawling high-speed rail network, highways packed with electric vehicles, and a boom in green energy, robotics and artificial intelligence. Chongqing - a humid southwestern metropolis which once made global headlines for a corruption scandal and murder - turned popular and cool.\\nThere have been other, smaller triumphs. Young people around the world are snatching Adidas Tang-style jackets off the shelves, bingeing on Chinese micro-dramas and experimenting with powdery make-up looks flaunted by Chinese girls and women on Douyin, China\\'s version of TikTok.\\n\"As a Chinese person who has been online throughout years and years of heavy Sinophobia, it felt refreshing to have the mainstream opinion finally shift regarding China,\" Claire, a Chinese-Canadian TikTok user, tells BBC Chinese.\\nThe 22-year-old, who shares political content on TikTok and would only reveal her first name for that reason, says, for her, the \"critical juncture\" was last year.\\nThat was when she noticed a shift in attitudes about China. A wave of Americans arrived on RedNote, a popular Chinese social media app, ahead of a TikTok ban in the US.\\nWithin days memes became the currency of these American \"TikTok refugees\" as two worlds that rarely interact because of China\\'s internet firewall were brought closer.\\n\"These young people have watched their physical reality remain frozen while China built entire cities,\" says Afra Wang, a tech writer and podcaster.\\n\"When you can\\'t build high-speed rail but you can scroll through videos of Chinese infrastructure, of course the future starts to look Chinese.\"\\nFor observers like her, it\\'s no coincidence that Chinamaxxing comes as the American Dream seems to be dimming.\\nAmericans who came of age after the Iraq War, the 2008 global financial crisis or even the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot face a job market disrupted by globalisation and then AI, Wang says: \"American exceptionalism was never something they lived.\"\\nWhat do people in China think of Chinamaxxing? Not much, it seems. The trend has stirred limited reactions on Chinese social media.\\nRather, in the eyes of Chinese people, America, once seen as a beacon of success, has lost its shimmer. Not least because tensions between the two sides have made it harder for Chinese students who want to study or work there.\\n\"During America\\'s Chinamaxxing moment, China is experiencing its own America-minimising moment,\" Wang says.\\nOn parts of Chinese social media, there are dystopian references to the \"US kill line\", a Chinese gaming term that refers to the perilous descent into poverty in the US. The idea, which took root quickly among users and influencers, is that America is a tough place to survive because a single stroke of bad luck can derail your life.\\nThe term\\'s popularity on social media is helped by the fact that it has been embraced by Chinese state media and the government. They have sought to portray the US as a decaying superpower because of inequality, a weak social safety net and a broken healthcare system.\\nAccording to a commentary in state-owned Xinhua, the \"kill line\" meme \"underscores how far the lived reality can drift from the ideals once broadcast to the world\".\\nIt\\'s little wonder that Chinese authorities are pleased with Chinamaxxing.\\n\"Chinese lifestyles increasingly gain global appeal, offer a steadier way of being,\" reads the headline of a Global Times piece about the trend.\\nWhen asked about it at a press briefing earlier this month, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said a \"unique blend of history and modernity\" is making China increasingly appealing to foreigners.\\nHe was \"happy\" to see foreigners experiencing the \"everyday life of ordinary Chinese people\".\\nAre they really?\\nFor one, it\\'s hard to know what Chinese people make of so many things because all public conversation and activity is heavily policed. Criticising the government is risky and protests are quickly quashed.\\nTwo, there is a lot the memes making it to the West don\\'t show. China\\'s youth are facing an unemployment rate that sits at more than 15% and burning out from a gruelling work culture, yet sharing too much of their pessimism online could alert internet censors. They are worried about finding a home as the country\\'s property crisis continues, and dating is no easier than anywhere else.\\nPropping up breakneck delivery speeds are gig workers scrambling to hit deadlines. Many can relate to the hustle: in 2023, Beijing courier Hu Anyan\\'s memoir about the relentless nature of gig work became a national bestseller.\\n\"When I think of my American friends and tech people wandering through Shenzhen in awe, I also think of my own experience in Shenzhen,\" Wang says. \"Drinking a six yuan latte from Luckin Coffee, delivered on a scooter by someone like Hu Anyan, whose labour makes \\'cool China\\' visible while remaining almost invisible themselves.\"\\nPerhaps, if the fascination with China\\'s successes continues, more of Chinese life will surface. But for now apple tea seems to be where it\\'s at.\\n\"Ever since I started boiling apples in my tea water my period cramps have completely gone,\" reads a comment on RedNote from an American user - one of the TikTok refugees still lingering on the app.\\n\"We have so much still left to learn being Chinese.\"\\nAdditional reporting by Eunice Yang from BBC Chinese\\n'},\n",

In its dialogue, in its portrayal of college life, in the kinds of characters it foregrounded - it achieved something unusual.\"\\nOften described as India\\'s first English-language feature, Annie occupies a singular place in the country\\'s cinema history: local in texture yet cosmopolitan in voice; modest in scale yet exacting in its writing.\\nMade on a modest budget, the film follows a ragtag group of final-year students at Delhi\\'s School of Planning and Architecture as they drift, stall and inch toward graduation.\\nIts title comes from a Delhi University slang: to \"give it those ones\" is to perform one\\'s usual act - bungles included.\\nAt its centre is Anand \"Annie\" Grover, an endearing fifth-year student suspended between idealism and chronic distraction.\\nHe keeps hens in his hostel room and dreams up improbable schemes to transform India - including planting trees along railway tracks, fertilised by waste from passing trains. Four years earlier, he scrawled a crude joke about the dean in the men\\'s toilet; he has failed every exam since.\\nAround him orbits a constellation of classmates - caustic, thoughtful, restless - who debate Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, Karl Marx and the price of cigarettes with equal seriousness.\\nRoy herself appears as Radha, sharp and self-possessed. The ensemble cast also includes a young Shah Rukh Khan - it was the Bollywood star\\'s screen debut.\\nWhat stands out in Annie is its relaxed, unvarnished portrait of student life: messy hostel rooms, friends lounging on charpoys smoking and arguing about everything from bureaucracy to exams, and a breezy irreverence toward authority.\\nStudents treat institutional rituals as a farce and openly mock their principal - calling him Yamdoot after the Hindu god of death - a blustering figure who addresses them as \"My dear donkey\".\\nRadha, Roy\\'s character, embodies the film\\'s carefree defiance. She smokes beedis (hand-rolled cheap Indian cigarettes) and dresses boldly, pairing a sari with a rakish hat, capturing the free-spirited energy of the campus.\\nIn her memoir Mother Mary Comes to Me, Roy explains that the script grew out of \"the wacky anarchy of that campus, the stoned, bombed-out students and the dialect of English that we spoke - an inventive mix of Hindi and English\".\\nThe response to the film was electric.\\nAt its first screening in Delhi, Roy recalls that \"students jammed into the hall and crowded on to the floor. Within a few minutes the audience began to yell, roar with laughter and wolf-whistle through the film. They recognised themselves, their language, their clothes, their jokes, their silliness.\"\\nBeyond its campus setting, Annie captures a moment when Indian cinema - and state broadcasters - were relatively permissive about youth culture, language and social critique.\\nIn the late 1980s, television allowed more room for satire and student life than it does today. In the decades since, films challenging social norms or scrutinising institutions have more often faced resistance from the censors.\\nWhen Annie was first released, it won two National Awards - for best screenplay and best English-language feature - but largely vanished after its television premiere, a quiet late-night screening on Doordarshan.\\nIts reputation, however, quietly grew.\\nBootleg recordings circulated among architecture students and cinephiles, who came to regard it as one of the few credible English-language Indian films of its time.\\n\"Nobody had really made a film about English-speaking students in India,\" Dungarpur said. \"Audiences weren\\'t used to hearing English spoken so casually. But that\\'s how students in [some] colleges speak to each other. Annie captured that without self-consciousness.\"\\nHe adds that audiences also recognised the mood of a country on the cusp of economic liberalisation, when a government job could represent both security and suffocation. The debates staged in the film - about hierarchy, bureaucracy and institutional power - remain familiar.\\n\"The issues the film speaks about are still prevalent,\" Dungarpur said. \"That\\'s why it resonates. It hasn\\'t dated in the way you might expect.\"\\nThe restoration of the film began almost by accident. While moving house, Krishen discovered trunks of scripts and papers and was about to junk them before a friend alerted Dungarpur, who retrieved the material and later proposed restoring Annie.\\nThe process required painstaking, almost forensic, effort. Colours had faded; the soundtrack posed its own challenges.\\n\"There\\'s a scene towards the end where Roy is wearing a red sari,\" Dungarpur said. \"In the surviving print, the red had almost disappeared. We had to ask: what kind of red was it?\"\\nSeen now, Annie feels almost like a prelude to Roy\\'s later life as a feted novelist and one of India\\'s most polarising writers. And yet, the film is lighter on its feet than her later reputation might suggest. It jokes. It rambles. It allows its characters to be foolish and tender.\\nAs Roy has said in a recent interview, its dissent lies in its \"tone rather than in slogans\".\\n\"Students were rebelling, but with hope and celebration, not anger. The film was about people finding joy in being themselves and saying we don\\'t want to conform,\" says Krishen in the same interview.\\nAs it returns to the screen, younger viewers may glimpse another era - flared trousers, drafting tables, cigarette smoke curling under fluorescent lights.\\nBut they may also recognise something more enduring: the persistence of the very systems the film gently mocks.\\n\"They\\'ll see how cool that time was,\" Dungarpur said. \"But they\\'ll also see how much of it feels familiar.\"\\n'},\n",

She took over after his father, Ziaur Rahman, the BNP founder and a key leader of Bangladesh\\'s war for independence, was assassinated.\\nAccused of benefitting from nepotism when his mother was in power, Tarique Rahman has also faced allegations of corruption. Five days before his mother died he returned to Bangladesh after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London.\\nAnd while Rahman, 60, has on occasion been the de-facto chair of an emaciated BNP when his mother was jailed and more recently when she was ill, he\\'s largely seen as an untested leader.\\n\"That he doesn\\'t have prior experience probably works for him, because people are willing to give change a chance,\" says political scientist Navine Murshid. \"They want to think that new, good things are actually possible.

Reviving the economy, reducing food prices and creating jobs for Bangladesh\\'s large young population are other massive challenges.\\nSociologist Samina Luthfa says the lack of experience of running a government affects all parties.\\nFor the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, which has been banned twice in Bangladesh\\'s history, including under Hasina, this is its first time winning a sizeable number of seats.\\nIts alliance partner, the National Citizens Party (NCP), formed by some of the students who led the uprising, has won six seats in its debut performance.\\n\"We are going to see leaders in the parliament who have never been to the parliament before,\" Luthfa says.\\n\"NCP youngsters have a lot to learn. The others are seasoned politicians but they do not have the experience of running the country. So it\\'s going to be an uphill task.\"\\nJamaat\\'s manifesto was secular and development-focused, making no mention of Islamic law.\\nBut its website reads: \"Jamaat performs in political arena because Islamic law can\\'t be implemented without political force\", which has always led to questions about what the party would do if it ever came to power.\\nMurshid says Jamaat\\'s performance in this election is unsurprising.\\n\"Jamaat is a very organised political party. For the last several decades, they have worked relentlessly at the grassroots level,\" she says.\\n\"I think that has to be recognised but, of course, the problematic part is that they are inherently anti-democratic, misogynistic and patriarchal.\"\\nLuthfa says all parties have let the women of Bangladesh down. Just over 4% of candidates were women.\\n\"We the women who were part of the July uprising - all political parties have failed to translate our collective agency into a more formal political, electoral arena,\" she says.\\n\"Parliament members now need to make haste so that they can bring in skilled, honest and deserving candidates to the seats reserved for women in parliament.\"\\nOf the 350 seats in Bangladesh\\'s parliament, 300 are elected and the remaining 50 are reserved for women who are nominated by political parties in proportion to their electoral performance.\\nWhile this election was starkly different from the past few polls under Hasina – being genuinely competitive, with the outcome not known before polling began - the barring of her party from the election has cast a shadow over its credibility.\\nGiven its claims of reviving democracy, when asked if it would support bringing the Awami League back into the political fold, senior BNP leader Chowdhury said: \"It is not for us to decide.\\n\"For the Awami League to come back to the electoral process in Bangladesh, it\\'s going to take a while, because their credibility is in question. When you are accused of killing your own people, of atrocities, persecution, then the people will decide where they fit in in the future of Bangladesh politics.\"\\nFrom her exile in India, Hasina has termed Thursday\\'s poll an \"election of deception and farce\" and has called for a fresh election in which the Awami League is allowed to participate.\\nAt the moment, public anger against her party is intense, but given Bangladesh\\'s political history, it would be premature to write off the Awami League forever.\\nAdditional reporting by Aakriti Thapar\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has secured a landslide majority in parliament, 18 months after mass protests ousted the country\\'s longest-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina.\\nThe party took more than two-thirds of seats in the historic general election, with Jamaat, the country\\'s main Islamist party, coming second. Hasina\\'s Awami League was banned from taking part.\\nBNP leader Tarique Rahman is set to be the next prime minister and faces huge challenges in getting the economy back on its feet and restoring democracy after 15 years of authoritarian rule under Hasina.\\nVoters also backed sweeping democratic reforms in a referendum held alongside the election.\\n\"I am grateful for the love you have shown me,\" Raman told well-wishers in Dhaka as he attended Friday prayers.\\nHis party said there would be no victory procession and he urged supporters to attend prayers instead of street celebrations in memory of his late mother, former PM Khaleda Zia, who died in December.\\nHis formal election as the country\\'s new leader will happen after new MPs are sworn in, which is expected to take place on Saturday.\\nRahman\\'s family background - his late father was also a leader of Bangladesh - is a reminder that while the BNP have promised change, Rahman, like Hasina, hails from a political dynasty.\\nThe absence of both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, who alternated in power over four decades, was one of a number of firsts in this election.\\nAnother was that, with the Awami League banned, Jamaat for the first time ran as one of the main parties vying for power. The alliance it leads took 77 seats, six of which went to the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) born out of the 2024 protests.\\nThe Awami League has questioned the legitimacy of the election given that it was unable to participate, while Jamaat has questioned the way the vote was conducted. Both it and the BNP have accused the other of voting irregularities.\\nFor Rahman, it is a huge change of fortunes. He spent 17 years in self-imposed exile in London before returning to the country five days before his mother\\'s death and is seen by many as largely untested.\\nAs well as being on track to become the country\\'s next leader, is also his first time as an MP. He was elected as member for the Dhaka-17 and Bogra-6 constituencies, and is one of 212 successful BNP candidates, according to the Election Commission, which put voter turnout at 59.44%.\\nDuring his campaign, Rahman promised that Bangladesh\\'s democracy would be restored.\\nReviving the country\\'s economy, bringing rising food prices under control and creating jobs for its huge young population are the big challenges facing the new government.\\nRepairing strained ties with giant neighbour India is also high on the list of priorities.\\nWithin hours of his win, Rahman had received a call from India\\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi who congratulated him on a \"remarkable victory\".\\n\"As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India\\'s continued commitment to the peace, progress, and prosperity of both our peoples,\" Modi wrote on X.\\nAlthough the BNP are promising to lead change in the country, the party was criticised for corruption and accused of human rights violations when it was last in government in the early 2000s.\\nRahman himself was subject to various criminal investigations while Sheikh Hasina was in power but was later cleared of all charges.\\nThursday\\'s democratic exercise is a moment of huge potential - and risk - for the country, with one of its two main parties winning such a big victory.\\nAmong the constitutional reforms envisaged are prime ministerial term limits, a directly elected upper parliamentary house, stronger presidential powers and increased judicial independence.\\nGreater representation of women in parliament is also in the charter but only a tiny number of female candidates were successful in the election, showing there is a long way to go.\\nOf the main parties, the BNP fielded 10 female candidates, the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) just two and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami none.\\nBoth the BNP and Jamaat have denied sidelining women, instead claiming the number of those standing was a result of Bangladesh\\'s \"social structure\".\\nOne voter, Shima Akhter, was among many women who took part in the student-led protests leading to Hasina\\'s downfall - paving the way for the election - and dismissed this as \"just a patriarchal excuse\".\\nRahman will be under great scrutiny to deliver for Akhter and other young people like her who are hungry for change as Bangladesh has one of the youngest demographics in the world.\\nWhile there may be mixed feelings among some about the election result and concerns over whether the BNP can deliver, Rashna Mahzabin is among those who are happy they got to \"raise their voices\" after years of authoritarian rule.\\n\"That\\'s a huge win,\" she told the BBC.\\nAdditional reporting by Azadeh Moshiri and Kathryn Armstrong\\n'},\n",

The mural, located in the heritage district of George Town, depicts two laughing children on a real bicycle, positioned to look part of the painting.\\nTourists can often be seen taking pictures with the mural, now an icon in Penang.\\nZacharevic said his work had been \"unlawfully reproduced\" on AirAsia\\'s aircraft without his knowledge or consent and displayed publicly on a plane in operation - one that he saw with his own eyes at an airport.\\n\"It felt a little offensive,\" Zacharevic said, recalling the moment in 2024.\\nHe posted a picture of the plane on social media, tagging the airline and saying that they needed to have a conversation about the use of the artwork.\\nSince then, he has held talks with the company, though neither side has been able to settle on terms, he said.\\nZacharevic said this was not the first time his work had been used in connection to AirAsia\\'s campaigns and products, accusing the airline of using his artwork on a delivery bag for its food services arm.\\nAccording to the court documents, Zacharevic said he held discussions with AirAsia in 2017 about an offer to make art for the airline\\'s jets and a mural in one of its offices.\\nHe alleges that the airline was made fully aware of his work and business rates at the time, according to the documents.\\nThe claim adds that in spite of this, the \"the airline proceeded to reproduce and publicly display one of the plaintiff\\'s principal works in a prominent setting, thereby wilfully infringing the plaintiff\\'s copyright and moral rights\".\\nMalaysia\\'s AirAsia is the largest low-cost carrier in Asia, operating more than 200 jets to more than 100 destinations. This week, it unveiled plans to resume flights from Kuala Lumpur to London via Bahrain, marking a return to the British capital after more than a decade.\\nZacharevic said he is leaving it to the court to decide the amount of any compensation he is entitled to.\\nThe artist said: \"I wish to be clear about one thing. I do not accept any characterisation of this use as merely a reference to cultural or geographical associations.\\n\"The artwork in question is a distinct artistic creation. It is not a natural or generic feature, but the result of many years of professional training, skill and labour.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': '\"My name is Mohammad Deepak.\"\\nWith these five simple words, a Hindu man who stood up for a Muslim shopkeeper has been catapulted to fame and become an unlikely hero in India.\\nDeepak Kumar has been praised as an \"icon for secular India\" and a \"posterboy for India\\'s pluralism\". At the same time, he has faced noisy protests, been called a traitor to his Hindu faith and received death threats.\\nThe incident that thrust him into the spotlight took place on 26 January in the small town of Kotdwar in the northern state of Uttarakhand. It has made headlines since a video recording of the incident went viral.\\nIt shows the 42-year-old gym owner arguing with activists of Bajrang Dal, a hardline Hindu group that routinely makes news for harassing Muslims.\\nDeepak said he was at a friend\\'s shop next door and intervened when he saw about half a dozen men heckling Vakeel Ahmed, the elderly owner of a clothing store called \"Baba School Dress and Matching Centre\". They were telling him to drop Baba from his 30-year-old shop\\'s name.\\nBaba is a commonly used term in India to refer to mystics and religious gurus and also to fathers or grandfathers by both Hindus and Muslims.\\nThe Bajrang Dal activists, however, insisted that Baba in Kotdwar could only be a reference to Siddhabali Baba - a local temple to Hindu god Hanuman - and that a Muslim had no right to use it in his shop\\'s name.\\nAhmed\\'s son is heard pleading with them for more time, but they are told it must be done soon.\\nThat\\'s when Deepak walked in on the scene - drawn by \"a lot of people crowding in front of the shop\", he later told BBC Hindi.\\n\"Are Muslims not citizens of India?\" he is heard asking in the video.\\nDeepak said his intervention was spontaneous and not part of a strategy. \"I did not like these young men talking so rudely with an elderly man. They were targeting him because of his religion. They were targeting Muslims.\"\\nAhmed, 68, says it\\'s difficult to say what would have happened if Deepak hadn\\'t been there. \"We were scared. They could go to any extent to get their point across.\"\\nAfter the push back from Deepak, the Bajrang Dal activists asked his name.\\n\"By identifying myself as Mohammad Deepak, I wanted to tell them that I\\'m an Indian. That this is India and everyone has the right to stay here, regardless of their religion,\" he said.\\nSurprised by this unusual cobbling together of Hindu and Muslim names, the vigilantes left. But a few days later, more than 150 Bajrang Dal supporters turned up to protest outside Deepak\\'s gym.\\nFollowing a complaint from Ahmed, the police registered a case against \"some unknown people\". They also registered a case against Deepak after a complaint from two Hindu activists.\\nThe protest and the police action have made headlines in India. Coming at a time when unprovoked attacks on Muslims by Hindu mobs have become routine, Deepak\\'s confronting of the vigilantes is being hailed as a rare act of heroism.\\nCongress party MP Rahul Gandhi has described him as \"a hero of India\" who is \"fighting for the constitution and humanity\". Deepak is spreading \"love in the marketplace of hate\", he posted on X, adding that \"we need more Deepaks - those who don\\'t bend, don\\'t fear and who stand with full strength with the constitution\".\\nAn article in the Indian Express said the video provided \"lots of hope\".\\n\"Deepak\\'s words come as a shot in the arm in a society that often seems to have been overtaken by hatred and intolerance. They remind us that this is the \\'real India\\', where everyone has the right to live and breathe as they please, and name their shop whatever they fancy,\" the report said.\\nMany others also took to social media to express solidarity with Deepak and commended him for standing up to bullies. His phone has been ringing non-stop, and he\\'s been much sought-after by journalists, photographs and other visitors.\\nHis follower count on Instagram has swelled and a short video he shared on 29 January has more than five million likes. In it, he says: \"I am not a Hindu, I am not a Muslim, I am not a Sikh, I am not a Christian. First and foremost, I am a human being.\"\\nDeepak is now trying to come to terms with his newfound fame and says he never imagined that a simple intervention would become such a big issue.\\n\"I simply did what I thought was right. I never thought the matter would become so big. But now it\\'s become national news,\" he said.\\nHis act of bravery, however, is not without consequence.\\nDeepak has faced backlash with critics calling him a traitor to his faith and leaving abusive messages on social media. He\\'s received numerous death threats - on Wednesday, he posted on X a recording of one such threatening phone call.\\n\"Bajrang Dal shouldn\\'t have spared you… I\\'ll teach you a lesson soon,\" the caller tells him.\\nBeaten and humiliated by Hindu mobs for being a Muslim in India\\nIndia election 2019: Meeting a \\'foot soldier\\' of the Hindu far-right\\nDeepak says the attention has left his family \"traumatised\". \"They are afraid. And I\\'m under a lot of mental pressure now.\"\\nHis once thriving gym is now largely deserted, bringing financial worries in its wake.\\n\"I used to have more than 150 people coming to train here daily. That number has now dwindled to 15. A lot of people are not coming because they are afraid,\" he said.\\nLast weekend, opposition MP John Brittas, who visited Deepak, called him \"a beacon of hope in the struggle against the Hindutva communalism\" and said he had taken \"a membership at his gym, which now stands deserted due to threats from communal elements\".\\nAs news of Deepak\\'s financial woes spread, people from across India offered to buy his gym membership because, as an X post by Joy Das said, \"We can\\'t let a good man lose.\"\\nDespite the threats and worries, Deepak says if he faces a similar situation in the future, he will still stand up against what is wrong.\\n\"If we remain silent today, tomorrow our children will also learn the same silence,\" he says.\\n'},\n",

The past few elections were widely condemned as systematically rigged in favour of Sheikh Hasina.\\nShe has been convicted and sentenced to death in absentia for ordering the brutal crackdown against protesters 18 months ago, in which the UN says as many as 1,400 protesters were killed.\\nHasina is in exile in India from where she\\'s rejected the charges against her and has questioned the legitimacy of the election.\\n\\nThe ban on her Awami League contesting the polls casts a shadow over whether this election can be described as free and fair. But, for the first time in years, voters on the ground were telling the BBC they feel like they have a choice.\\nMore than 120 million people were eligible to vote, about four in 10 of them under 37. They were also casting their ballots in a referendum on constitutional change, which was proposed by the interim government that replaced Hasina and is aimed at fixing what it has called a completely broken political system.\\nSpeaking after voting, Bangladesh\\'s interim leader - the Nobel Peace Price laureate Muhammad Yunus - said the country had \"ended the nightmare and begun a new dream\".\\nTurnout had reached 49% by 14:00 local time (08:00 GMT), the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting told the BBC.\\nNearly a million police and soldiers have been deployed to maintain law and order.\\nYunus voted in the capital Dhaka, as did the two leading candidates, Tarique Rahman, 60, for the BNP, and Jamaat\\'s leader Shafiqur Rahman, 67.\\nBefore casting his ballot, Rahman said he was feeling \"confident\" about how the election would play out. He told the BBC he\\'d been waiting \"more than a decade\" for this day.\\nHe has criticised Jamaat for using religious sentiment to win votes, and is promising economic and democratic reforms, as well as a \"rainbow nation\", where a new \"National Reconciliation Commission\" would help the country move past its divisions.\\nThe son of the late Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh\\'s first female prime minister, Rahman is a product of dynastic politics many reformers would like to change. Zia herself came to power after her husband, a former president, was assassinated in a military coup.\\nBoth the BNP - the Awami League\\'s long-time rival - and Jamaat-e-Islami have a long history in Bangladesh, and both were crushed along with other opponents of Hasina under her long rule.\\nRahman, who lived in London during the Hasina years, may be tipped as front-runner for prime minister, but Jamaat is expected to mount a serious challenge.\\nOn two previous occasions - in the 1990s and the early 2000s - Jamaat has been a junior partner in a coalition led by the BNP in constitutionally-secular Bangladesh.\\nBut, with the Awami League absent, Jamaat is for the first time a major player on the ballot - though it\\'s chances of winning are seen by most observers as slim.\\nShafiqur Rahman, a former political prisoner, and his party have run a well organised grassroots campaign on a platform of justice and ending corruption. They are also not associated with dynastic politics.\\nJamaat gained momentum of its own in the run-up to the vote, and many of its new supporters believe it has modernised.\\nBut many female voters feel sidelined, despite the fact women played a leading role in the uprising.\\nOf the 30 candidates Jamaat is allowing the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) to field, only two are women. Jamaat is fielding more than 200 candidates, all of them men. The BNP fielded 10 women out of more than 250 candidates.\\n'},\n",

The NIS believes Kim Jong Un has an older son, but this son has never been acknowledged nor shown on North Korean media.\\nNews of Ju Ae\\'s existence first emerged through an unlikely source: the American basketball player Dennis Rodman, who revealed to The Guardian newspaper back in 2013 that he \"held baby Ju Ae\" during a trip to the secretive state.\\nJu Ae made her first appearance on state television in 2022. She was shown inspecting North Korea\\'s latest intercontinental ballistic missile while holding her father\\'s hand.\\n\\nShe has since made frequent appearances on state media, softening her father\\'s image of a ruthless dictator. She accompanied him to Beijing for China\\'s largest-ever military parade, where she was seen stepping off his armoured train at Beijing Railway Station.\\nShe is often seen wearing her hair long, which is forbidden for her peers, and wearing designer clothes, which are out of reach for most in her country.\\nAnother lawmaker, Park Sun-won said the role Ju Ae had taken on during public events indicated that she has started to provide policy input and is being treated as the de facto second-highest leader.\\nThe North Korean power had passed down the three generations of the Kim family, and it is widely believed that Kim Jong Un will pass on the throne to Ju Ae.\\nIn recent months, she was shown standing taller than her father, walking beside him, rather than following him.\\nIn North Korea, where photos published by the state media are believed to carry a great symbolic weight, it is rare for individuals other than Kim Jong Un to be positioned equally prominently in the frame.\\nAlthough the South Korean spy agency now believes Ju Ae is the designated heir, it still raises questions.\\nIt is puzzling why Ju Ae, a daughter, would be selected as the heir above an older son in North Korea\\'s deeply patriarchal society.\\nMany defectors and analysts had previously dismissed the idea of a woman leading North Korea as an unlikely scenario, referring to the country\\'s entrenched traditional gender roles. But Kim Jong Un\\'s sister - Kim Yo Jong - does offer a precedent for female authority in the regime.\\nKim Yo Jong currently holds a senior position in the Central Committee of the Workers\\' Party of Korea, and is reported to have influence over her brother.\\nHowever, it is also a mystery why Kim Jong Un, who is still young and appears relatively healthy, is already designating a 13-year-old child as his heir now.\\nIt is unclear what changes Ju Ae\\'s succession may bring to North Korea.\\nMany North Koreans hoped that Kim Jong Un, a Western-educated young man, would open their country up to the outside when he succeeded his father.\\nYet such hope was unfulfilled. Whatever plans this teenager may have for her country, she would likely have the singular power to shape it however she likes.\\n'},\n",

This is the first time since 2022 that he has made any reference to corruption in his annual greeting.\\nZhang, 75, was vice-chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) - a top military leadership group headed by Xi, when he was purged.\\nAnother senior officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also removed from his post along with Zhang.\\nThe most recent purge comes on the back of another crackdown which saw nine top generals - including some CMC members - removed from their posts in October 2025. Authorities at the time said the purges were part of an anti-corruption drive as well.\\nRecords show that 14 full-rank generals have been sacked or investigated in the past three years.\\nThe latest purges have decimated the seven-member CMC to just two - of which one is Xi himself.\\nThe latest comments by Xi are highly unusual.\\nHe never does press conferences or gives interviews - even to the tightly-controlled Chinese media.\\nBut even he must occasionally reassure the population, and especially the Party cadres, that what he is doing makes some sort of sense.\\nSpeaking about the crackdown is likely designed to convince them that there is a plan in place, especially given that the latest round of purges would have impacted the military\\'s ability to fight and win a war in the immediate future.\\nXi has made the fight against corruption a central pillar of his rule, calling it the \"biggest threat\" to the Communist Party and saying that the battle \"remains grave and complex\".\\n\"The actual language surrounding the purges do not provide much detail about what exactly is going on internally, whether it really is corruption, political struggles, outright purges, or something else,\" said Professor Chong Ja Ian of the National University of Singapore.\\n\"Publicity surrounding the purges are meant to be a signal, more likely domestic and internal to the CCP than anything else.

       "  'Article': 'Warning: This story contains distressing details\\nShaheen Malik, an acid-attack survivor and disability rights activist in India, is fighting an uphill legal and social battle to secure justice and rehabilitation for others like her - and says she will not give up despite the odds.\\nOne survivor she\\'s been helping is Ruman* who alleges that her husband beat her and forced her to drink acid during an episode of domestic violence in 2019.\\nThe alleged incident left her with severe internal injuries and a damaged oesophagus that had to be artificially reconstructed so that she could eat.\\nDespite years of treatment, Ruman struggles to swallow food and eats little. At 28, she weighs just 21kg, less than the average weight of an eight-year-old girl. Basic tasks like going to the bathroom exhaust her and she needs constant medical supervision.\\nBut despite her grave situation, Ruman is unable to seek compensation and rehabilitative benefits that acid attack survivors are allowed under India\\'s disability law.\\nThe Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 only recognises those as victims who have suffered visible disfiguration due to the \"throwing of acid or similar substances\", excluding those who have been forced to ingest acid.\\nIn December, Shaheen petitioned the Supreme Court saying the disability law must also include survivors like Ruman.\\n\"For survivors of forced acid ingestion, the disfigurement is internal and hence not as obvious. But their lives are extremely challenging as they find it difficult to breathe, speak and swallow food despite numerous surgeries,\" she says.\\nMalik, 42, has been campaigning for the rights of acid attack survivors for over a decade. Her determination to help others seems to come from the challenges she has had to battle as a survivor.\\nShe has undergone 25 surgeries and lost vision in her left eye after she was attacked with acid outside her workplace in northern Haryana state in 2009. Malik was in her 20s at the time and was working as a student counsellor.\\nFor 16 years, she fought a legal battle to bring her perpetrators to justice before a trial court acquitted them in December. Malik says she\\'s devastated, but not defeated, and has challenged the verdict.\\n\"I fought for justice for myself. But now, I\\'m fighting for the sake of other survivors and victims of abuse. I want my case to be an example of justice served, that perpetrators won\\'t walk free and will be made to face the consequences of their actions,\" she says.\\nIn 2021, Malik set up the Brave Souls Foundation - a non-profit that offers legal and economic aid to acid attack survivors. The foundation acts as a lifeline for those who have been shunned by society and their families and have nowhere to go for help.\\nAround 50 survivors live in the foundation\\'s shelter home in Delhi\\'s Jangpura neighbourhood, where they are offered care and assistance. Ruman is among them as she does not want to be a burden on her parents, who are old and struggling to make ends meet, Malik says.\\nThe foundation is also helping Ruman fight her case after her husband appealed against his conviction in a higher court and was released on bail last year.\\nMalik says she and Ruman are among hundreds of survivors who are fighting an uphill battle for justice. The conviction rate in acid attack cases is abysmally low with cases languishing in courts for years.\\nA 2024 report which analysed data from 2017-2021 found that from the 600 cases pending trial in 2021, only 15 were disposed off by courts.\\nThis trend is confirmed by by the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, which shows that of the 703 cases pending trial in 2023, only 43 were disposed off, with convictions in 16.\\nMeanwhile, the number of acid attack cases in the country have been rising - NCRB recorded 176 in 2021, 202 in 2022 and 207 in 2023.\\nLast month, while hearing Malik\\'s petition, the Supreme Court directed all states to furnish a yearly report of acid attacks, cases disposed off and those pending in courts, as well as rehabilitation schemes offered to victims. It also sought details of victims forcefully made to ingest acid.\\nStrongly condemning acid attacks, the judges called for \"extraordinary punitive measures\", including auctioning the assets of attackers to compensate their victims.\\nThe court also asked the federal government to consider \"legislative interventions\", like shifting the burden of proof on to the accused from the victim.\\nWhile Malik welcomes the top court\\'s observations and directions, she says that along with sprucing up laws, there\\'s an urgent need to ensure their proper implementation.\\nShe points out that acid attack survivors still struggle to get affordable medical care even though private and public hospitals are legally mandated to provide free treatment to them, including reconstructive surgeries.\\n\"Many private hospitals refuse to admit acid attack survivors until they are furnished with a court order, delaying life-saving treatment to victims,\" she says.\\n\"And even after they are admitted, hospitals make the patient wait for long hours to receive treatment and often, discontinue it mid-way by making excuses,\" she adds.\\nShe also questions why it remains so easy to buy acid despite the increase in cases and existing regulations around over-the-counter sale of the substance.\\n\"A single incident alters our whole life. We are treated like outcasts by society and face so many difficulties. Shouldn\\'t the government do more to prevent more people from suffering the same fate as us?\" Malik says.\\nMalik is intimately acquainted with the stigma and social isolation she talks about.\\nA few months back, Malik says, she was told to move her foundations\\'s office without being given any reason. She says she has been searching for a new place for weeks, but hasn\\'t been able to find one.\\n\"Many people feel that we [acid attack survivors] may bring them back luck. Some feel uncomfortable seeing our faces. So, many people don\\'t want to rent to us,\" she says.\\nBut Malik says she won\\'t give up and will continue fighting for a space for people like herself in society.\\n*Survivors have shared only one name.\\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.\\n'},\n",

But he is also a seasoned politician. Despite long ties to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), India\\'s governing Bharatiya Janata Party\\'s (BJP\\'s) ideological parent, the 62-year-old was a late entrant to electoral politics.\\nSingh, who belongs to the BJP, was first elected in 2017 and has since served as assembly speaker and a state minister overseeing portfolios including education and rural development.\\nNow, as he takes charge of a troubled state, the question is whether he can help bring peace?\\nOpinion remains divided. While some Manipur residents and analysts told the BBC they see hope in his leadership, others remain sceptical.\\n\"It is difficult to say anything right now, and the next few weeks will be crucial in giving a clearer picture,\" Pradip Phanjoubam of the Imphal Review of Arts and Politics magazine, told the BBC.\\nEven as Singh takes office, tensions in Manipur continue to simmer.\\nOn 21 January, a man from the Meitei community was killed in a Kuki-Zo-dominated area where he had been living with his wife, who is from the Kuki-Zo community. This was the latest in a series of killings linked to the conflict.\\nHours after Singh took oath on 4 February, protests broke out in the state\\'s Churachandpur district, with roads blocked and markets and offices shut.\\nKuki-Zo civil society groups and student organisations condemned the participation of some Kuki-Zo legislators in the formation of the new government, calling it a \"betrayal\" and reiterating their demand for a separate administrative arrangement for Kuki-Zo-dominated areas.\\nWhile the valley areas in Manipur, including its capital, Imphal, are largely inhabited by the Meiteis, Kuki-Zos predominantly live in the surrounding hills.\\nEven as tensions between Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities persist, new frictions have emerged between Kuki-Zo and Naga tribal groups, adding another layer of complexity to Manipur\\'s unrest. Tensions were reported on Sunday in the state\\'s Ukhrul district, where authorities have imposed restrictions on gatherings following an alleged assault involving villagers from the two communities.\\nSingh belongs to the Meitei community. And three ministers in his cabinet, including one deputy chief minister, are from the Kuki-Zo community - a composition that reflects an effort by the BJP to balance ethnic representation in a deeply divided state.\\nBut some in the Kuki-Zo community are not convinced.\\n\"Peace is not just the absence of violence. It requires trust, justice and political sincerity,\" Mang Khongsai, a Kuki student leader, told the BBC.\\nKhongsai says he does not believe that Singh can bring peace under the current circumstances.\\n\"He [Singh] is part of a political establishment that has failed to produce a credible roadmap to resolve the conflict, assure security or address the core demand for separate administrations.\"\\nGlady Vaiphei Hunjan, an adviser to the Kuki-Zo Women\\'s Forum in Delhi, says peace could not be \"imposed by maintaining the status quo\".\\n\"Leadership that can bring peace must demonstrate moral clarity - by acknowledging where the state has failed, engaging all stakeholders equally and committing to a political solution rather than administrative management of a conflict,\" she says.\\nManipur, with a population of about three million, covers roughly 22,327 sq km (8,620 sq m), is one of India\\'s smallest states that is slightly larger than Wales.\\nThe state has a long history of armed resistance and the violence of the past two years has seen militias and village volunteers take up arms amid deep communal mistrust. It has long been subject to a controversial law that gives the military sweeping power in regions designated as \"disturbed areas\".\\nDespite decades of unrest, Manipur has built a reputation as one of India\\'s most consistent producers of elite athletes - such as Olympic weightlifter Mirabai Chanu, boxer Mary Kom and judo champion Sushila Devi Likmabam. This is often attributed to a strong local sporting culture, early exposure to football, boxing and martial arts and community-run clubs that have long offered structure and opportunity - a tradition Singh himself was part of.\\nSunzu Bachapatiyum, a filmmaker who belongs to the Meitei community, says he is optimistic about Singh\\'s leadership.\\n\"He [Singh] is one politician who has working relationships with leaders across communities - that is a significant advantage,\" he says. \"The fact that he could gather sufficient legislative support to form a government suggests a degree of acceptability. In the current climate, that is at least a step forward.\"\\nSingh can play a \"significant role\" in bringing peace in Manipur, says journalist Kshetrimayum Premchand, who belongs to the Meitei community. \"He is a good administrator. Whether as a legislator or a state minister, he has been transparent about his functioning.\"\\nSome observers also point to Singh\\'s December 2025 visit to a relief camp for internally displaced Kuki-Zo people as a significant factor in his emergence as the chief ministerial choice. The outreach, widely seen as unusual for a senior Meitei leader during the conflict, could have helped broaden his acceptability among Kuki-Zo legislators, say analysts.\\nBut Seram Rojesh, convener of the Delhi Meitei Coordinating Committee, says lasting peace would require the \"disarming of armed ethnic groups\" that have played a role in the violence.\\nArambam Noni, an associate professor in Imphal\\'s Dhanamanjuri University says Singh should prioritise \"dialogue\" and \"ensure non-violation of the rule of law\". He also cautions against giving into the demand of Kuki-Zos for a separate administration because \"it can have ripple effects for others, who can escalate similar demands, given Manipur\\'s overlapping cultural and ethnic diversities\".\\nThe return of an elected government creates space for political engagement, but deep mistrust between communities has resurfaced even in periods of relative calm, say analysts.\\n\"Peace will depend on whether that authority is used to rebuild trust across communities rather than simply restoring administrative normalcy,\" says Phanjoubam, the Imphal-based editor.\\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'As the dust from what has been a hard-fought election campaign in Thailand settles, many Thais may be rubbing their eyes and asking, \"what just happened?\".\\nMost of the opinion polls published before the election predicted a win for the progressive People\\'s Party. Some suggested it would get more than 200 seats in parliament, a significant improvement on its already impressive 2023 result when it won 151. Few polls put the party of Prime Minister Anutin Chanrvirakul ahead.\\nYet once most of the votes had been counted, it was clear Anutin had achieved a stunning victory, and the young reformists had suffered a big setback. With a projected share of more than 190 seats, the path of Anutin\\'s Bhumjaithai party is clear to form the next government, albeit with coalition partners.\\nSo why did a youthful, progressive party with an imaginative and tech-savvy campaign do so poorly compared to a transactional, old-style party with little ideological identity aside from strong loyalty to the monarchy?\\nThe mixed voting system played a part. People in Thailand cast two ballots, one for a candidate in their constituency, and one for the party they prefer.\\nAt the national level the People\\'s Party, with nearly 10 million votes, did much better in the party list than Bhumjaithai, with just under six million votes, although this was still a big drop compared to the more than 14 million Move Forward, the previous incarnation of the People\\'s Party, won in 2023.\\nBut the party list accounts for only 20% of the 500 seats in parliament.\\nAs many as 80% of the seats are allocated by local contests, where whichever candidate get the most votes in each constituency wins the seat on a first-past-the-post basis.\\nThis is where the People\\'s Party, which is relatively new and urban-based, is weaker because it lacks rural networks.\\nBhumjaithai, by comparison, is a past master at using its substantial resources to win local power-brokers to its side, and they exercise a lot of influence over voters in their areas.\\nAnutin has used the defections of political veterans from other parties to grow Bhumjaithai from a medium-sized provincial movement which won only 51 seats in 2019, to a national-level election-winning powerhouse today.\\nIt was also harder for the reformists to distinguish themselves on a single issue this time. In 2023, after nine years being ruled by the stern, avuncular Prayuth Chan-ocha, the general who led the 2014 coup, there was a broad yearning for change, and the Move Forward party, under its suave, telegenic leader Pita Limjaroenrat, promised no deals with \"the uncles\" – those involved in the coup.\\nThis captured the imagination of the public, and there was a last-minute wave of support for them.\\nIn this election, there was no such defining issue, and the party had been forced to drop its campaign to amend the harsh lese majeste law after this was used by the courts to justify dissolving Move Forward and banning its leaders from politics.\\nAnutin was also able to coalesce conservative support around his party, as opposed to having their voters split among several parties in 2023.\\nHis strident nationalism over the border conflict with Cambodia, his staunch support for the army and his intense loyalty to King Vajiralongkorn all defined him clearly as the standard-bearer for Thai conservatism.\\nAnother big factor was the steep decline in the fortunes of Pheu Thai, the once unbeatable election machine backed by former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra.\\nIt came second in 2023, with 141 seats, but is likely to see that total halved this time round after the past three years of political turmoil in which two of its prime ministers were dismissed by the constitutional court, and it was accused of mishandling relations with Cambodia.\\nThaksin has been jailed on old corruption charges, and could face further criminal complaints.\\nBack in 2023, Pheu Thai lost support to Move Forward. This time, Bhumjaithai and other conservative parties were the beneficiaries of Pheu Thai\\'s falling popularity in its old strongholds of the north and north-east.\\nSome in the reformist camp will look back on their party\\'s controversial decision to back Anutin to become prime minister last September, after the fall of the second Pheu Thai administration.\\nAt the time, the People\\'s Party justified this strange alliance with its ideological opposite by promising not to join his government, and by extracting from him a pledge to hold a referendum on changing the military-drafted constitution, a priority for the reformists.\\nBut by not insisting on cabinet positions in return for their votes in parliament, the People\\'s Party allowed Anutin to fill his cabinet with capable technocrats, burnishing his credentials as a can-do leader.\\nAnd while the constitutional referendum was indeed held at the same time as the election on Sunday, and produced a clear vote in favour of changing it, the process of drafting and approving a new charter is so protracted it might be indefinitely delayed.\\nSome now see this as a poor decision, which tarnished their reputation among more idealistic followers.\\nIn the end, though, the reformists always had a mountain to climb to get into government.\\nMany of their leaders have already been banned from politics, their party has been dissolved twice, and one of their best members of parliament is likely to go to jail for six years on lese majeste charges.\\nEven after their election loss, another 44 of their leading members now face bans from politics by the Supreme Court for supporting the proposal by Move Forward to soften the punishments under the lese majeste law.\\nThese impediments may well have disillusioned some of the voters who backed Move Forward three years ago. Turnout in this election at 65% was sharply down from the 75% seen in 2023.\\nAnutin will face no such impediments.\\nThe many means by which elected governments, parties and politicians can be constrained by unelected bodies – the \"handcuffs\" on Thai democracy – have only ever been used on those challenging the status quo.\\nProvided he can make terms with smaller coalition partners, the prime minister has a good chance of completing a full four-year term, something no civilian leader has managed to do in Thailand for 20 years.\\n'},\n",

Once Bangladesh\\'s pro-democracy icon, critics say she had grown increasingly autocratic. After her resignation, she fled to India.\\nStudents gather in knots, debating politics. On an unkempt lawn, red lanterns sway above a modest Chinese New Year celebration - a small but telling detail in a country where Beijing and Delhi are both vying hard for influence. For many here, the election scheduled for 12 February will be their first genuine encounter with the ballot box.\\nNobel peace-prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge days after Sheikh Hasina\\'s fall. Hasina now lives in exile in Delhi, which has refused to return her to face a death sentence imposed in absentia over the brutal security crackdown in 2024 - violence in which the UN says around 1,400 people were killed, mostly by security forces.\\nHer Awami League - the country\\'s oldest party, which commanded some 30% of the popular vote - has been barred from contesting. Analysts say the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is now moving to occupy the liberal-centrist space it has vacated. The main Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, has joined forces with a party born out of the student uprising.\\nBut the slogans on the campus - and beyond - are not only about democracy at home. It increasingly points across the border.\\n\"Dhaka, not Delhi\" is splashed on walls - and stitched onto saris, a traditional dress for women in South Asia. Among the young, \"hegemony\" has slipped into everyday speech, shorthand for India\\'s long shadow over Bangladesh.\\n\"The young generation feels India has been intervening in our country for many years,\" says Mosharraf Hossain, a 24-year-old sociology student. \"Especially after the 2014 election, which was basically a one-party election.\"\\nThat grievance - Delhi\\'s perceived role in enabling Bangladesh\\'s democratic erosion - sits at the heart of a sharp rise in anti-Indian sentiment. The result: India-Bangladesh relations, once touted as a model of neighbourhood diplomacy, are now at their lowest ebb in decades.\\n\"Delhi is struggling in Dhaka because of deep anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh and a hardening, often a hostile turn, in India\\'s own domestic political discourse towards its neighbour,\" says Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London.\\nMany blame Delhi for supporting an increasingly authoritarian Hasina in her final years and see India as an overbearing neighbour. They remember disputed general elections in 2014, 2018 and 2024 and Delhi\\'s \"endorsement\" of them.\\n\"India supported Hasina\\'s regime without any pressure, without any questions,\" Hossain says. \"People think the destruction of democracy was supported by India.\"\\nThat sense of betrayal has merged with longer-standing grievances - border killings, water-sharing disputes, trade restrictions and inflammatory rhetoric from Indian politicians and television studios - into a more corrosive belief: that India views Bangladesh less as a sovereign equal than as a pliant backyard.\\nLocal media is rife with reports that an Indian conglomerate supplying electricity to Bangladesh has been cheating the country - a charge the group denies. On Facebook, a key platform for political mobilisation, campaigns rage to ban a leading daily branded an \"Indian agent\". Both countries have suspended most visa services.\\nDelhi\\'s decision to bar a Bangladeshi cricketer from the Indian Premier League (IPL) and refusal to move Bangladesh\\'s T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka has fed resentment across the border.\\n\"To be sure, India has channels with all stakeholders in Bangladesh. But translating such engagement into positive political outcomes remains challenging in the current political climate,\" says Paliwal.\\nDelhi has indeed begun to broaden its outreach.\\nLast month Foreign Minister S Jaishankar travelled to Dhaka for former prime minister and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Khaleda Zia\\'s funeral, and used the occasion to meet the party\\'s acting chairman Tarique Rahman. The 60-year-old heir to the Zia dynasty, Rahman recently returned after 17 years in exile in London and now looms as the frontrunner in the landmark election.\\nIndia has also opened channels to Islamist forces. A senior Jamaat-e-Islami leader told me that Indian officials have engaged the party\\'s leadership four times in the past year, including a recent invitation to the Indian High Commission\\'s Republic Day reception in a Dhaka hotel.\\nYet these tactical shifts have done little to arrest the broader slide. Kamal Ahmed, consulting editor of The Daily Star newspaper, says the current chill marks a low unseen even during earlier crises. \"There\\'s no doubt this is the lowest point of the bilateral relationship,\" he told the BBC.\\nThe contrast with the Sheikh Hasina years is stark.\\nOver 17 years, Dhaka \"opened up almost all fronts for India\" - security co-operation, transit, trade, cultural exchange and people-to-people ties. Today, Ahmed says, \"nothing is moving - neither people nor goodwill\".\\nWhat appears to have turned scepticism into anger was Delhi\\'s response after Hasina was ousted last August. Many Bangladeshis said they expected India to recalibrate a Bangladesh policy that had rested almost entirely on backing one party. Instead, India appeared to double down - offering Hasina refuge and tightening visa and trade restrictions. The message received in Dhaka, Ahmed says, was: Bangladeshis were \"not being valued as neighbours\".\\nRhetoric has worsened matters.\\nWhen Indian politicians label Bangladeshi migrants \"termites\" or talk of teaching Bangladesh a lesson \"like Israel did in Gaza,\" Ahmed asks: \"How do you expect people in Bangladesh to react?\"\\nCultural retaliation followed - calls to boycott Indian goods, the suspension of IPL broadcasts - driven by resentment. \"Culture, trade, respect - nothing is one-way traffic,\" Ahmed says. \"Unfortunately, that\\'s how the current Indian leadership is practising it.\"\\nYet officials in Dhaka caution against reading the relationship solely through its crises.\\nShafiqul Alam, press secretary to Yunus, describes ties with India as \"multi-dimensional\", anchored in geography as much as politics. \"We share 54 rivers... We share language, we share the same history,\" he says, citing trade flows and daily movement across a 4,096km (2,545-mile) frontier.\\nEven so, Alam admits public sentiment has hardened sharply.\\nAsk Bangladeshis why they could not vote freely for over 15 years, he says, and many give the same answer: Sheikh Hasina\\'s authoritarianism - and India\\'s \"backing\" of it. \"They also say that Hasina has always been supported by India.\"\\nHasina\\'s flight to India after the 2024 violence remains an especially sore point.\\n\"Hundreds of young people were killed... and then she fled to India,\" Alam says. The perception that she was treated as a \"head of a government\", rather than a disgraced leader, deepened anger.\\nAlam also criticises Indian media coverage as alarmist, dismissing claims of systematic persecution of minority Hindus as \"a massive disinformation campaign\". Isolated incidents do occur, he says, but are routinely portrayed as religious violence. \"Come and visit,\" he urges Indian journalists. \"Meet the people and see what actually happened.\"\\nIndia, meanwhile, says independent sources have documented more than 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities - including killings, arson and land grabs -during the interim government\\'s tenure, adding that these cannot be all \"media exaggeration or dismissed as political violence\".\\nAli Riaz, an academic who is currently serving as the special assistant to Yunus, believes the rupture runs deeper than miscommunication.\\n\"It has reached the bottom,\" he says. He believes that over time, the relationship narrowed down to \"a relationship between a party or an individual and the Indian establishment, rather than between Bangladesh and India\".\\nLong-standing disputes amplified the damage. Water sharing, Riaz argues, creates hierarchy. \"If you control the water, the relationship immediately becomes unequal.\"\\nBorder killings cut deeper still. \"It is viewed as how the Indian establishment see the lives of Bangladeshis.\" India has denied unlawful killings by its forces in specific deaths along the border.\\nThese issues, analysts say, are not episodic irritants but symbols of imbalance.\\nThat imbalance, critics argue, was reinforced after Hasina\\'s fall. Mohammad Touhid Hossain, foreign affairs adviser to Yunus, says India failed to recalibrate, missing a chance to reset ties with the interim government. \"We tried to go forward on a number of occasions, but then the response from India was on again, off again,\" he told me.\\nIndia, for its part, has voiced concern over Bangladesh\\'s \"deteriorating security environment\" and called for \"free, fair, inclusive and credible elections\" conducted peacefully.\\nPolitical strain is now spilling into economic ties. Bilateral trade of $13.5bn could be far higher if tariff and non-tariff barriers were eased and diplomatic relations improved, says Fahmida Khatun of the think tank Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD). \"Political tension has led to economic tension.\"\\nYet this hardening at the state level does not always translate neatly on the street.\\n\"Whenever I hear India, I think it is my enemy,\" says Fatima Tasnim Juma of Inquilab Mancha, a cultural platform known for its nationalist anti-India messaging.\\n\"But when it comes to people, it does not work like that.\" Juma says she grew up in a Hindu-majority area; relatives move easily across the border. \"Our conflict is with the Indian government or the structure. Not with people.\"\\nAnti-Indianism has been notably subdued on the campaign trail - not because it has faded, but because every political contender knows that a reset with India is unavoidable.\\nEven so, repairing India–Bangladesh ties will not be quick - or cosmetic.\\n\"A reset won\\'t be easy simply because there\\'s an election or a new government. The background [issues] will remain,\" says Alam.\\nStill, the rupture is not irreversible. \"No state relationship is,\" says Riaz - but the burden of repair, he argues, lies largely with Delhi and will require moving beyond the habit of managing Dhaka through favoured intermediaries. Ahmed says Bangladesh is open to normalising ties, but India needs a reset that works with whoever holds power in Dhaka.\\nPolitical figures frame the reset in moral as much as strategic terms.\\nMahdi Amin, a key adviser to BNP leader Rahman, puts it bluntly: \"The bigger the nation, the more the responsibility.\"\\nPeople-to-people ties, he argues, can only grow if India aligns its policy with the aspirations of Bangladeshis, not just the preferences of governments.\\nJamaat-e-Islami\\'s assistant general secretary Ahsanul Mehboob Zubair offers a cautious echo: \"If those in charge in both countries act with sincerity, accept present realities, and treat each other with mutual respect and dignity, a constructive relationship is possible.\"\\nThat space for repair still exists - and a new government could make a difference.\\n\"The current situation is more than a diplomatic chill, and less than a structural break,\" notes Paliwal.\\n\"Geography, history, and shared cultural heritage means that India and Bangladesh cannot wish away each other.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Hong Kong\\'s pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for colluding with foreign forces under the city\\'s controversial national security law.\\nThe 78-year-old, who was convicted in December, is the most prominent person to be charged under the contentious law. It was introduced by China in 2020, in response to massive pro-democracy protests which erupted in Hong Kong the year before.\\nThe law criminalises anything Beijing deems to be subversive or secessionist, from chanting slogans to participating in pro-democracy protests. Beijing says it is necessary to maintain stability in Hong Kong but critics say it has effectively outlawed dissent.\\nHailed a hero by the pro-democracy movement, Lai has long been viewed as a traitor by Hong Kong authorities and Beijing. He emerged as a key critic of China and his Apple Daily newspaper became a platform for Hongkongers who wanted more freedom.\\nWhen the sentence was read out in court on Monday, Lai, who has been detained since December 2020, smiled calmly and nodded. He has always denied the charges against him, saying he had fought for the freedoms that he believed were Hong Kong\\'s values.\\nHong Kong says Lai has been given a fair trial under the rule of law, but critics say his case shows how the city\\'s legal system has been used to silence political opposition.\\nHis family has voiced concerns about his deteriorating health in detention. This August, his son Sebastien told the BBC that even if his father - a British citizen - got just five years in prison, it was \"practically the same as a death penalty.\"\\nRights groups on Monday also criticised the sentence, saying it was \"effectively a death sentence\" given Lai\\'s age.\\nSebastien also criticised UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for not securing Lai\\'s release when he visited China in January. The \"values [that the UK stands for] are being locked up along with my father,\" he said.\\nLai became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory.\\n\"I\\'m a born rebel,\" he told the BBC in an interview in 2020, hours before he was charged. \"I have a very rebellious character.\"\\nLai was born in Guangzhou, a city in southern China, to a wealthy family that lost everything when the communists took power in 1949.\\nHe was 12 years old when he fled his village in mainland China, arriving in Hong Kong as a stowaway on a fishing boat.\\nWhile working odd jobs and knitting in a small clothing shop he taught himself English. He went from a menial role to eventually founding a multi-million dollar empire including the international clothing brand Giordano.\\nThe chain was a huge success. But when China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing\\'s Tiananmen Square in 1989, Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur.\\nHe started writing columns criticising the massacre that followed the demonstrations in Beijing and established a publishing house that went on to become one of Hong Kong\\'s most influential.\\nAs China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland, leading him to sell the company, Lai launched a string of popular pro-democracy titles that included Next, a digital magazine, and the widely read Apple Daily newspaper.\\nIn a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Lai had been a persistent critic of Chinese authorities both through his publications and writing.\\nThis has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of the city.\\nBut on the mainland he is viewed as a \"traitor\" who threatens Chinese national security.\\nIn recent years, masked attackers firebombed Lai\\'s house and company headquarters. He was also the target of an assassination plot.\\nBut none of the threats stopped him from airing his views robustly. He was a prominent part of the city\\'s pro-democracy demonstrations and was arrested twice in 2021 on illegal assembly charges.\\nWhen China passed Hong Kong\\'s new national security law in June 2020, Lai told the BBC it sounded the \"death knell\" for the territory.\\nThe media mogul is known for his frankness and acts of flamboyance.\\nIn 2021, he urged Donald Trump to help the territory, saying he was \"the only one who can save us\" from China. His newspaper, Apple Daily, published a front-page letter that finished: \"Mr President, please help us.\"\\nFor Lai, such acts were necessary to defend the city which had taken him in and fuelled his success.\\nHe once told news agency AFP: \"I came here with nothing, the freedom of this place has given me everything... Maybe it\\'s time I paid back for that freedom by fighting for it.\"\\nLai has been charged with various offences - including unauthorised assembly and fraud - since 2020.\\nThe prosecution of Lai has captured international attention, with rights groups and foreign governments urging his release.\\nOver the years, Sebastien Lai has travelled the world to denounce his father\\'s arrest and condemn Hong Kong for punishing \"characteristics that should be celebrated\".\\n\"My father is in jail for the truth on his lips, courage in his heart, and freedom in his soul,\" he had said.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'On a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong\\'s Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.\\nThey had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory.\\nThey would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.\\nIn prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"\\nBut neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.\\nDecades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy.\\nThat proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China\\'s Communist Party rulers in Beijing.\\nLai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave.\\n\"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.\\nHe wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That\\'s what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong\\'s pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.\\nLai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party\\'s values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled in December when it convicted him.\\nIt said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.\\nLai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied, including sedition under a separate colonial-era law. The most serious one, colluding with foreign forces, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\\nOn 9 February, the court jailed him for 20 years in a hearing that lasted less than 30 minutes. It is the harshest sentence given so far under the NSL - \"an effective death sentence\", given his age, according to rights groups.\\n\"Never,\" Lai had said to the charge of collusion when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong\\'s values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".\\nHis conviction in December was welcomed by Hong Kong\\'s chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".\\nBack in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong\\'s surprise.\\nLai\\'s Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn\\'t complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"\\nPeace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.\\nFor Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.\\nApple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.\\nFrom a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\\nFormer editors and employees spoke of Lai\\'s encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.\\nThey describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn\\'t afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper\\'s editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"\\nIt had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.\\nThat was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn\\'t have ended up like this either.\"\\nAn early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.\\nIt became a self-fulfilling prophecy.\\nIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.\\nAfter carrying a passenger\\'s luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he\\'s from. He said Hong Kong. I said, \\'Hong Kong must be heaven\\' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.\\nLife in Mao Zedong\\'s China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.\\nDecades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"\\nUncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"\\nAnd so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao\\'s devastating rule - over the years.\\nThe day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.\\nBy his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.\\nBusiness often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People\\'s spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong\\'s strength.\\nThe book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired. \"I want to turn the author\\'s thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.\\nAfter a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.\\nLai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.\\nThen in 1989, Beijing crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.\\nGiordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.\\nA million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.\\nLai said later that he \"didn\\'t feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".\\nThe following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".\\nBeijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano\\'s flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\\n\"If I just go on making money, it doesn\\'t mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.\\nHe soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong\\'s pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.\\nHe became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997.\\n\"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn\\'t have freedom?\"\\nDuring the handover, however, China\\'s then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.\\nThe 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing\\'s refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.\\nProtesters occupied the city\\'s main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.\\nThe movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.\\nWhat began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.\\nLai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he\\'s a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"\\nApple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.\\nGovernment adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".\\nWhether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.\\nLai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily\\'s parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.\\nDuring the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".\\nAll of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong\\'s internal affairs.\\n\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".\\nBeijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city\\'s freedoms severely curbed.\\nLee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"\\nLai\\'s family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai\\'s Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.\\nCarmen Tsang, Lai\\'s daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa\\'s place… They think he\\'s a funny guy\".\\nShe is not sure today\\'s Hong Kong has a place for Lai.\\n\"If there\\'s a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Japan\\'s ruling party, led by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, is on course to win Sunday\\'s snap election by a landslide.\\nThe coalition led by Takaichi\\'s Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) has won 352 of 465 seats in Japan\\'s House of Representatives, figures collated by public broadcaster NHK suggest, with the LDP alone securing a majority of 316.\\nThe country\\'s first female prime minister had sought a clear public mandate by calling the election just four months after becoming party leader.\\nHer apparent success is in marked contrast to her two predecessors, under whom the party lost its parliamentary majority due to corruption scandals and rising costs.\\nTakaichi previously pledged to step down if her party failed to secure a majority, and some called the snap election a big gamble.\\nThe LDP lost its majority in both houses of parliament in 2024, and its decades-old coalition with the Komeito party collapsed.\\nBut Takaichi\\'s personal popularity appears to have helped the party, with approval ratings for her government mostly hovering above 70%.\\nThe LDP\\'s current coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, is thought to have secured 36 seats, with opposition parties winning a combined 113 seats, according to NHK figures.\\nWhen officially confirmed, the election success will give Takaichi wide scope to push through her conservative agenda.\\nUS President Donald Trump has already congratulated Takaichi on the projected victory, describing her as a \"highly respected and very popular\" leader.\\n\"I wish you Great Success in passing your Conservative, Peace Through Strength Agenda,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\\nHe added: \"The wonderful people of Japan, who voted with such enthusiasm, will always have my strong support.\"\\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hailed a \"big victory\" for Takaichi, saying \"when Japan is strong, the US is strong in Asia\".\\nIndian Prime Minster Narendra Modi also congratulated Takaichi for the \"landmark\" result, saying he was confident India and Japan\\'s friendship could be taken to \"greater heights\".\\nPeople across Japan braved snow to vote in the country\\'s first mid-winter poll in 36 years.\\nJapan\\'s transport ministry said 37 train lines and 58 ferry routes were closed and 54 flights cancelled as of Sunday morning. There was rare snowfall in Tokyo as people headed out to vote.\\n\"People want their lives to be better and more comfortable because we are so accustomed to not having inflation [costs rising]... so people are very worried. I think we need a long-term solution rather than short-term fixes,\" Ritsuko Ninomiya, a voter in Tokyo, told the BBC.\\nTakaichi\\'s enthusiasm, populist spending promises and nationalist rhetoric appear to have energised voters.\\nHer social media presence has also cultivated new followers, particularly among young voters. She regularly shares clips of her daily life and political activities, and a video of her playing the drums with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung is one of many clips to have gone viral.\\n\"I think this election is more important for the younger generation, people like us,\" Daniel Hayama said, adding that the cold weather was not a hurdle for young people who want to vote.\\nTakaichi and the LDP faced a more unified opposition than before. LDP\\'s former coalition partner Komeito has joined forces with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan to form the largest opposition bloc in the lower house.\\nTakaichi has pushed to toughen the immigration system, review rules around foreign ownership of Japanese land, and tackle any non-payments of tax and health insurance by foreign nationals.\\nBut in a country where only 3% of the population are foreign nationals, critics have accused her of creating anxiety and division.\\nCritics, including businesses, are sceptical that her pledge to spend more and cut taxes can revive the sluggish Japanese economy. The country\\'s government debt is already one of the highest among developed nations.\\nRelations with China - Japan\\'s largest trading partner - have been strained as well, after Takaichi suggested last November that Japan could intervene militarily if China invaded Taiwan.\\nWith a two-thirds majority, Takaichi would be in a strong position to consider her long-held aim of changing Japan\\'s pacifist constitution.\\nTakaichi has courted Trump, who has publicly endorsed her - an unusual move by a US president - and they both seem to agree that Japan should spend more on defence.\\nThat relationship too was on voters\\' minds as they headed to the polls on Sunday.\\n\"I am concerned with what President Trump is doing as well as the national defence issues. I am not sure where the money is coming from to cover that. So balancing budget spending between defence and people\\'s life is a major concern for me,\" Yuko Sakai says.\\nAdditional reporting by Kelly Ng and Chika Nakayama\\n'},\n",

The feared crisis that could have occurred had they won, and once again been barred from office, has been averted.\\nOpinion polls have frequently been wrong in Thailand, but there will be a lot of post-election analysis of how Anutin turned his once small, provincial Bhumjaithai - \"Thai Pride\"- party into such a formidable electoral machine.\\nPlaying on patriotic sentiment after the two short border wars with Cambodia last year, Anutin\\'s party became the standard-bearer for conservatives, promising to defend the status of traditional Thai institutions like the monarchy and military.\\nHe campaigned on hard-line nationalist sentiments and populist giveaways - but his victory was also down to his ability to win local power-brokers to his side, in an electoral system where 80% of seats were decided in individual constituencies on a first-past-the-post basis, with the remaining 20% allocated on the proportion of the vote won at a national level.\\nHe also broadened the appeal of his party by putting well-known technocrats with reputations for competence at the heart of his campaign.\\nThe People\\'s Party did much better in the proportional votes, but appears to have lost some of the support it had in 2023, and was unable to overcome its lack of networks at a local level.\\nThe third main contender was the Shinawatra family and its Pheu Thai – \"For Thais\" – party, which is projected to win 86 seats, a huge drop from its 2023 result.\\nIn the past it dominated elections, with well-marketed populist policies. It formed a coalition administration after Move Forward was blocked in 2023, but had two of its prime ministers dismissed by the notoriously interventionist constitutional court.\\nIts standing in Thailand was damaged by accusations it had mishandled the conflict with Cambodia, and by its patriarch, former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, being sent to jail last September.\\nThe state of the economy was uppermost in many voters\\' minds, with household debt at record levels and growth far lower than in previous years.\\n\"I want the economy to improve and I don\\'t want big factories to relocate to our neighbouring countries,\" civil servant Phananya Bunthong told the BBC, a reference to Thailand falling behind Vietnam.\\nThe People\\'s Party promised big changes, from curbing the power of the biggest businesses and military, to streamlining the extensive bureaucracy and modernising the education system. In the eight years since the movement was founded its radical agenda has been popular with younger Thais.\\n\"I want change. I don\\'t want things to be the same,\" 28-year-old Kittitat Daengkongkho told the BBC.\\nBut it is clear from the result that this time that agenda was less successful among older people and those in the provinces, than the simpler promises of financial assistance made by Anutin\\'s party.\\nAlongside the election, Thais also voted in a referendum on whether to reform the 2017 constitution, which was drafted under military rule in 2017.\\nCritics of the charter believe it gives too much power to unelected institutions like the courts and senate, \"handcuffing\" the country\\'s democracy.\\nWith over 90% of votes counted, preliminary tallies suggested around 65% had voted in favour.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'At 70, Biana Watre Momin took a leap far from home.\\nThe retired college teacher left the Garo Hills in north-eastern India\\'s Meghalaya state, where she led a quiet family life - caring for four dogs and doting on her grandchildren - and travelled more than 3,000km (1,864 miles) south to Kerala to act in a film.\\nShe was dealing with a language she did not understand, embracing a role whose meaning would only reveal itself once the camera began to roll.\\nThe film was Eko, a Malayalam-language film that would change the course of her life.\\nFor Momin, a member of the Garo tribe - one of the indigenous communities of Meghalaya, a largely tribal state - acting had never been an ambition, or even a distant curiosity.\\n\"Growing up, my town did not have a cinema or theatre,\" she told the BBC. She was never trained in the performing arts, \"unless you\\'d call teaching in a classroom a kind of performance\", she adds with a laugh.\\nA retired English literature teacher from Tura Government College, with a fondness for Romantic poetry, Momin had little reason to believe that a camera would one day frame her face. Yet when Eko entered her life, it offered an unexpected adventure.\\n\"I was initially hesitant as I had no experience in acting and was concerned about the long travel from home,\" she says. \"But my daughter nudged me, saying, \\'Have faith in yourself and try something new.\\'\"\\nIn Eko, a title that plays on the word \"echo\", Momin plays Mlathi Chettathi, an enigmatic elder living alone in the Western Ghats, a vast mountain range along India\\'s western coast known for its dense forests and mist-covered hills. As the film\\'s lead, her presence anchors its fog-laced landscape and moral core.\\nShot on a modest budget and completed in 45 days, Eko, showing on Netflix, has emerged as a critical success.\\nMuch of the intrigue surrounding the film centres on Momin\\'s performance, both for its quiet power and for her unusual profile.\\nDirector Dinjith Ayyathan was searching for a fresh face to play an elderly Malay woman who flees Malaysia during the Japanese invasion of World War II and arrives in Kerala accompanied by men with hidden motives.\\nOver decades, she lives alone in a crumbling house atop a forested mountain, sharing her world with feral dogs and drifting clouds, while men claiming friendship and family ties attempt to unravel the mystery around her.\\nThe search for the right actor led the Eko team to reach out to friends in the fledgeling film industry and even the Indian army stationed across the eight north-eastern states, looking for someone whose features might plausibly pass as Malay.\\nIt was then that images and clips of Momin, who had recently appeared in a short film on Garo folklore exploring the transformation of human souls into animals, found their way to the Kerala-based scouting team.\\n\"It seems an unusual coincidence that a short film involving animals led me to a role also set in the company of animals,\" Momin says.\\nOn a rainy day, she travelled with her son to meet the director and writer for an audition.\\n\"We gave her a fictitious situation: approaching police officers to report her missing son,\" says Eko\\'s writer and cinematographer Bahul Ramesh. \"Her spontaneity, emotive restraint and quiet confidence stood out immediately. Her courage to move far from home and attempt something entirely new at this age won us over.\"\\nThough often described as an eco-mystery or psychological thriller, Eko resists easy categorisation - and so does Mlathi Chettathi. She is neither ornament nor mystical cliché. Instead, she carries a quiet authority, observant and grounded.\\n\"I am proud, as an indigenous person, that there are creative people willing to take a chance on me at this age,\" Momin says. \"I hope it inspires more representation.\"\\nRamesh describes her performance as \"organic and intuitive\". \"What was extraordinary was her fearlessness and stepping onto a film set for the first time at 70,\" he says.\\nFor Momin, the shoot was an education.\\n\"Suddenly, I was a student again,\" she says. She learnt her Malayalam lines phonetically with help from a language coach, followed position cues, absorbed emotional beats and adapted to the rhythm of a professional film set.\\nAlthough her dialogue was later dubbed by a local voice artist, Momin memorised and delivered her lines during filming. The shoot involved long treks up a mountain each day, unpredictable weather, veteran actors, heavy equipment and frequent rushes to beat the rain and descending clouds.\\n\"I am a strong woman,\" she says. \"I didn\\'t fall sick despite the weather, and I was adventurous enough to try the cuisine in Kerala.\"\\nCrew members say they were struck by her sharp grasp of emotion, angles and movement. Momin credits her life experience. \"I have lived a full life and could draw from that,\" she says. \"I also come from a matrilineal tribe, similar to Kerala, and my feminism informed my approach to the role.\"\\nRamesh agrees. \"This is a self-reliant character who outwits those trying to exploit her with silent grit and steely determination. Momin slipped into this feminist folklore with quiet understanding.\"\\nAccolades have followed her, with national award-winning Tamil actor Dhanush calling it a \"world-class performance\".\\nFollowing Eko\\'s success, filmmakers from Bollywood and beyond have approached Momin with scripts. \"Talks are on,\" she says carefully. \"Acting is strenuous work. Let\\'s see what surprises are in store.\"\\nFor the time being, Momin has returned to her life at home, keeping busy with her family and her book club. \"We\\'ll be discussing Arundhati Roy\\'s Mother Mary Comes to Me this week,\" she says cheerfully.\\nBiana Momin did not become an actor in the conventional sense. What she became instead was a reminder that cinema, at its best, does not manufacture truth but learns to recognise it.\\n\"Old age should burn and rage at close of day,\" she quotes Dylan Thomas, momentarily sounding like the teacher she once was.\\n'},\n",

This party is above.\\nAs the sun sets across the city, on every rooftop we can see families and friends, laughing, shouting, watching as kites zig zag, circle, and soar through the city\\'s skies.\\n\"It\\'s really difficult!\" Abu Bakar Ahmad tells me.\\nThe 25-year-old tech engineer has been coached by his cousin, coaxing the kite higher and higher with a twitch of the string.\\n\"All our generations here are very excited; the elders know how to fly a kite, but we Gen-Zers don\\'t know.\"\\nThe festival has returned after nearly two decades. Marking the start of spring, it dates back centuries, but was banned in 2007 after several years of injuries and fatalities caused by sharp kite strings, falls and aerial firing.\\nIt means for many this is their first time flying; they\\'ve never seen the skies above Lahore like this. Others are practising the skill after years.\\n\"It\\'s gathering, it\\'s love. Flying kites is ok, but the main thing is bonding,\" Kanwal Amin, 48, tells me. \"I like watching and eating good food.\"\\nKashif Siddiqui is a pharmacist, but admits his kite flying is a bit rusty. He shows me pictures of his last Basant - then Kashif\\'s son was three. Now his son is here with his own children.\\n\"It\\'s special for Lahori\\'s - this runs in our blood. It\\'s not about kite and thread, it\\'s about tradition. My father and his father before him used to do it.\"\\nKashif\\'s aunt, Mina Sikander, 60, is here from Miami; she didn\\'t want to miss out.\\n\"I\\'m very fond of this festival,\" she says. \"It was worth the journey!\"\\nKite flying is not just about beauty, it\\'s about the battle to knock your opponent\\'s kite out of the sky by cutting their string.\\nThat led to ever sharper, stronger threads, some coated in powdered glass, others made from metal or chemical material that would not break.\\nEach festival there were deaths, including of children. It was particularly dangerous for motorcyclists who could inadvertently drive into a thread draped across a road, cutting their throats.\\nCelebratory aerial firing and falls from rooftops also caused injuries and fatalities.\\nIn a bid to try to make the festival safer, it\\'s now been limited to only three days.\\nMotorcyclists have been given metal rods, sticking up between their handlebars, to stop any threads they drive into from becoming tied around their necks.\\nLarge kites are banned because they require a stronger string and create a bigger risk, the authorities say.\\nNets have been placed over certain streets; in previous years metal kite strings have fallen on to electricity wires giving an electric shock to anyone holding them - and causing the wires to short circuit.\\nTo prevent anyone flying before the festival officially began any kites sold before February 1 were seized along with any string deemed dangerous.\\nFaisal Kamran, Deputy Inspector General of Lahore Police, shows us some of more than 100,000 kites and 2,100 rolls of string he says his team seized.\\nHis officers are monitoring the skies and rooftops through drones, officers watching in person and repositioned CCTV cameras.\\n\"All these cameras were covering our main roads,\" he says pointing to images now looking across Lahore\\'s rooftops. \"We have a good view just to keep a check on activities like if somebody is using that banned material or weapons.\"\\nHe says the cameras will be turned back to the roads when Basant is over.\\nMany are hoping the measures are a success, not least the Punjab government who decided to bring Basant back and have been promoting it.\\nIn the narrow streets of Mochi gate, customers hold their paper kites overhead to stop them getting ripped as they squeeze through the crowd and past the occasional slow moving motorbike.\\nUsman, one of the kite sellers, tells me he\\'s sold more than 7000 kites in just a few days.\\nYousaf Salahuddin has been one of the festival\\'s key supporters and advocates for decades.\\nIn the 1980s he hosted the glitterati of Pakistan at the festival and invited the media to cover it to raise its profile. He says it makes a financial difference to the city too.\\n\"There was a lot of revenue,\" Yousaf says. \"And that revenue was going down to the poorest - the vendors on the street, the restaurants in the old city, the people who dyed the clothes, the people who were selling shoes, bangles, everything.\\n\"And then the hotels were all booked, there were extra flights coming in.\"\\nHis first memories of the festival date back to before he was old enough to fly kites, when instead he would rush across the rooftops to catch the kites whose strings had been cut.\\nYousaf felt emotional seeing them back in Lahore\\'s skies in such numbers for the first time this weekend.\\n\"It\\'s always been a part of us, I don\\'t remember the city without kites,\" he says.\\nThat doesn\\'t mean he wants to fly them though.\\n\"I don\\'t have the patience, I flew one last night and it got cut,\" Yousaf says. \"So I said, \\'I\\'m not flying anymore - I\\'m done!\\'\"\\n'},\n",

We never got books to read, but I was always curious about them. I kept thinking that I should read, gather books and gain knowledge,\" he told the BBC.\\nGowda\\'s library is located in Pandavapura, a small municipality in Karnataka\\'s Mandya district. It lacks the rigid organisation usually associated with libraries. In fact, Gowda\\'s collection doesn\\'t have a librarian and books are stacked on shelves and piled on the floor in a haphazard manner.\\nOutside, under the library\\'s awnings are sacks filled with an estimated 800,000 books, still waiting to be unpacked. The collection is still growing, through Gowda\\'s purchases and donations from others.\\nThe place is frequented by students, their parents, teachers and book lovers. Regular visitors seem to know their way around the library and find the books they need with ease. And even if they can\\'t, they say, Gowda can find anything.\\nGowda, his wife and son live in a corner of the library, which is open every day of the week - and for long hours.\\nGowda spent his childhood juggling school and helping his father with farm work. He would often ask his parents and elder sister for money to buy books.\\nWhen he began reading books about Indian freedom fighters and spiritual leaders, he got hooked.\\n\"They were like candy,\" he says.\\nInspired by a teacher, he started building a small collection of books so that other students from rural areas could also read.\\nHe often used the money his parents gave him for food to buy books instead.\\nSoon after finishing school, he started working as a bus conductor.\\nOne day, about 10 months into the job, he bumped into a former teacher who was shocked to hear that he had quit studying. He insisted that Gowda resign and go to college.\\nGowda followed his advice and went on to get a postgraduate degree in Kannada (the official language of Karnataka), before joining the Pandavapura sugar factory as a timekeeper.\\nHe would spend two-thirds of his monthly salary on books, and use the remaining money for groceries and other necessities.\\n\"Salaries were low then, but prices were also low,\" he says.\\nOver the 33 years he worked at the factory, Gowda attended dozens of conferences of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat - a non-profit dedicated to developing the local language and literature - and would often buy discounted books from them.\\nHe also augmented his income by raising cows and selling milk, and working as an insurance agent.\\nHis next hurdle would be familiar to book lovers everywhere - finding space to house his overflowing collection.\\n\"I started keeping the books in trunks [large metal boxes]. Then I installed bookshelves in my house. But at one point, there was no place left,\" he says.\\nAt the time, he had acquired around 50,000 books.\\nHelp came when some of his friends met Hari Khoday, the late liquor baron who was building a temple in Pandavapura.\\nKhoday, recalls Gowda, couldn\\'t believe that one man could own so many books.\\n\"He came and saw the books for himself. Then he asked me what I needed. I told him I didn\\'t want any money for myself. My only request was that he build a library,\" Gowda says.\\nKhoday agreed and paid for the construction of a huge building, which is now part of Gowda\\'s sprawling library which stretches across 15,800 sq ft (1,467 sq m).\\nSome years later, a local lawmaker brought then Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy to see the library and he authorised money for the construction of two more structures attached to the first one.\\nToday, students and teachers from across the state visit the library. Among them is Ravi Bettaswami, an assistant professor at a private college who says that he has also been inspired to build a collection of thousands of books.\\n\"I have used Gowda\\'s library to study and have taken my students there so they could read and also help organise the books,\" he says.\\nShilpashree Haranu, who teaches at a government college, says that the collection may look messy as it has not been organised by a professional librarian.\\n\"But he [Gowda] knows exactly where each book is and can tell you in an instant,\" she says.\\nWhen asked why he never hired a librarian, Gowda says no-one ever suggested that to him.\\nAs for the future of the library, Gowda strikes a philosophical note, suggesting that it is now up to others to take his legacy forward.\\n\"I have fulfilled my responsibility.

Instead, it is one of some 5,800 agencies overseen by the Ministry of Culture, whose regulatory powers are far more limited.\\nTheir training programmes are not subject to regulation or inspection, a local official told the BBC.\\nAn official from the Ministry of Education told the BBC that current regulations did not restrict travel and entertainment agencies from teaching language and dance to foreign nationals, so it was difficult to regulate such \"academy-type agencies\".\\n\"I dreamed of becoming an idol - but what I went through felt more like a scam,\" Miyu, who is still a teen, said.\\n\"[This is] where I pursued my dream, but it also brings back my trauma.\"\\nMiyu was drawn to K-pop in middle school.\\nIt was Lisa - the Thai rapper-singer who arrived in Korea as a teen and shot to global fame with the K-pop girl group Blackpink - who inspired her journey.\\nLisa is far from an anomaly in K-pop today. Twice has three Japanese members and one Taiwanese member, and NewJeans has a Vietnamese-Australian singer. Hearts2Heart, which debuted last year, includes the country\\'s first Indonesian idol.\\nBut making it to the top, like they have, is tough in what has become a cutthroat K-pop industry. A handful of powerful agencies run the show, which means they have to bet on an aspiring star for them to succeed in Korea.\\nHybe, South Korea\\'s largest entertainment company and the label behind big names like BTS, does not disclose how many trainees it has on board at any given point.\\nThe industry average is estimated to be around 20. But Hybe did tell the Korea Herald newspaper in 2023 that nearly one in three of its trainees are foreign nationals.\\nSM Entertainment, another industry giant, has a dedicated academy for aspiring K-pop performers, and says the majority of its students come from overseas, but did not provide exact figures.\\nBut the number of trainees enrolling is shrinking, according to an industry report published in January.\\nIn 2024, agencies reported 963 trainees, about half of the number they had signed on in 2020: 1,895. Although the number of foreign trainees reported by agencies doubled to 42 between 2022 and 2024, they are still a fraction of the total figure.\\nIt\\'s a highly competitive selection process, and firms weigh up costs to make the decision.\\nTypically it takes about two years for a trainee to debut, and even then only 60% of them make it, according to the report. For foreign trainees, the barriers are even higher - language, visa restrictions and industry connections, all of which possibly worsen already slim odds.\\nAnd yet the allure of fame draws so many like Miyu to take their shot. Miyu and the other two trainees the BBC spoke to said their academy catered almost exclusively to foreign students and that there were no Korean students enrolled.\\nIt\\'s hard to know how many foreigners travel to South Korea to enrol in these training programmes because they can do this on a tourist visa that allows them to stay up to three months at a time.\\nSoon after she got there, Miyu claimed, reality collided with what she was promised. She said the standard of the dance and voice training was not what she expected, given the cost of the programme.\\nShe said a senior staff member also began constantly monitoring her whereabouts. After about three months into the programme, he took her out, she claimed.\\n\"He took me to a convenience store alone saying he would buy me ice cream. While I was choosing, he put his hand on my waist and said, \\'good body\".\\nHe called her on several occasions, according to Miyu. Once, he asked her to come to the office, saying they needed to discuss outfits for a photo shoot. \"He told me to sit on his lap to discuss costumes. I managed to sit on the armrest instead. From that day onwards, I get scared just hearing a man\\'s voice.\"\\nAnother former foreign trainee Elin, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, also accused the same staff member of touching her inappropriately.\\nShe said the staff member had called her into a meeting room and asked for them to be left alone. He then touched her waist while telling her the Korean word for \"hip\", saying he was teaching her Korean.\\n\"I was so scared that I texted my friend and asked her to come quickly,\" Elin said.\\nShe also alleged that the staff member would come into their dormitory room, an allegation repeated by Miyu and the third trainee the BBC interviewed.\\n\"He would come… sometimes at two or three in the morning, saying he was fixing the lights. This one time he entered my room while I was asleep and just watched me,\" Elin said, adding she had woken up when she sensed someone entering the room.\\nHe left the room without doing anything, but she said she \"couldn\\'t sleep properly after that because I was so scared\".\\nWhen the BBC contacted the company for comment, their legal representative denied the claims, saying: \"Our company strictly prohibits anyone from entering the female trainees\\' dormitory without being accompanied by a female staff member, as set forth in our internal regulations.\"\\nElin also claimed that CCTV cameras recording both video and audio had been installed throughout the practice rooms and female dormitories - this allegation was also repeated by Miyu.\\n\"The CCTV was live 24/7. They were picking up the audio as well... I didn\\'t sign any consent to being filmed 24/7,\" said Elin, adding that the senior staff member \"would watch us while we were dancing and make comments through the CCTV\".\\n\"At one point, he told the teacher, \\'This isn\\'t sexy enough — you need to teach the girls a sexier dance,\" she said.\\nThe company, however, denied that the staff member entered the female dormitory, and said the cameras were installed only in common areas, such as entrances and kitchens, for \"safety reasons\", following past incidents involving intruders.\\n\"The installation was announced in advance and intended entirely to safeguard the trainees,\" the legal representative told the BBC in a written response. Elin says she was never told of this.\\nEventually, Elin dropped out of the programme and left Korea.\\nThe three girls told the BBC that they didn\\'t speak up immediately because they were worried that it could harm their chances in the K-pop industry. They said they also felt unable to tell their parents, who had paid large sums for them to train in Korea. And they faced other challenges, including the language barrier and an unfamiliar legal system.\\nElin eventually went to the police and registered a case against the staff member, accusing him of sexual harassment and trespassing. But the police dropped the case, citing a lack of evidence. The staff member denied all the allegations. Her lawyers told the BBC that she was looking to appeal against the decision.\\nShe has also registered a separate case against the company for breach of contract because of the alleged sexual harassment, trespassing in the dorms and CCTV surveillance.\\nMeanwhile, the company has continued recruiting students and still promotes its K-pop training programmes on social media. When Elin saw this, she was furious.\\n\"K-pop has gained worldwide fame — and with that comes responsibility,\" she said. \"At the very least, I hope the children who chase this dream can do so in a safer environment.\"\\nMiyu says she still dreams of becoming an idol.\\n\"Whenever things were hard, I held on by listening to K-pop. I still want to become an idol, no matter what.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Japan heads to the polls again on Sunday for its second general election in as many years. The snap vote has caught the ruling party, the opposition and much of the electorate off guard.\\nSanae Takaichi, Japan\\'s first female prime minister, is betting on her personal popularity, hoping to succeed where her party failed just last year: delivering a clear public mandate for the long-ruling but deeply unpopular Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).\\nIt is a political gamble - one her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, made, and lost badly. Voters will now decide whether it will pay off.\\n\"The difference this time is that her approval across most media polls has been much, much higher than her predecessors,\" says Rintaro Nishimura, an analyst and senior associate at The Asia Group\\'s Japan Practice.\\n\"Conventional wisdom says: when approval is high, you call an election.\"\\nSince taking office last October, Sanae Takaichi has dominated headlines, not through policy or legislation, but through political performance.\\nThe \"work, work, work\" mantra in her acceptance speech reinforced the image of an energised, relentless leader.\\nIn just over three months, she has cultivated a highly visible public profile. She\\'s taken high-profile visits from world leaders, including receiving Donald Trump only a week into her premiership.\\nWhen they appeared aboard the USS George Washington in Yokosuka, the prime minister raised her fists in the air as President Trump lavished her with praise.\\nAnd just two days before February\\'s vote, President Trump endorsed Takaichi saying she has \"already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader... one that truly loves her country\".\\nThere was also her surprise appearance playing the song Golden from the film K-Pop Demon Hunters on the drums alongside South Korea\\'s president, and the selfie with Italy\\'s prime minister.\\nThese were all viral moments projecting confidence and momentum, and distanced her from the traditionally stagnant and at times boring image of her predecessors.\\n\"There is an atmosphere of positivity about her being the first female prime minister in Japanese history, about her being successful at diplomacy… with her having approval ratings in the 60s or sometimes as high as 70%,\" says Jeffrey Hall, lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies.\\nProfessor Hall added that this image has been propped up by \"a large conservative group on the internet of users and social media influencers who provide a strong base for Takaichi, with posts showing her in a positive way going viral almost every day during the election\".\\n\"So we have an atmosphere where users who log on to X [formerly Twitter]… the algorithm will be showing them very positive videos about Takaichi.\"\\nTakaichi has also consolidated support among the LDP\\'s conservative base, reviving long-dormant goals such as constitutional revision and emphasising traditional values.\\n\"She\\'s positioned herself as the leader who brings the LDP back to its [conservative] origins,\" Nishimura says. \"That has resonated internally among party elders as well as with the LDP base.\"\\nBeyond the conservative base, Takaichi has connected with younger voters in a way not seen by a Japanese leader before. Her handbags and pink pens have become unlikely zeitgeist items.\\n\"There\\'s definitely an appeal among young people,\" Hall says.\\n\"Young people tend to be the most disconnected from politics in Japan… but Takaichi has taken on this kind of idol-like, or celebrity-like, status among some young people.\"\\nHe points to media reports of sana-katsu - obsessive fan activity inspired by idol culture.\\nThat personal appeal has translated into strong approval ratings which have hovered between the mid-fifties and high sixties, according to NHK and other major media polls.\\nKoichi Nakano, associate professor of political science at Sophia University, says that despite initial grumbling when the snap election was announced, the LDP appears to be riding high on the prime minister\\'s popularity. A recent Asahi Shimbun survey suggests the party is on track to gain significantly more than the 233 seats needed for a majority in the 8 February lower house election.\\n\"If the party does well,\" Nakano says, \"many MPs will feel grateful. Their scandals will be washed clean, and they\\'ll become very obedient.\"\\nA political funding corruption scandal that was revealed just over two years ago saw dozens of LDP lawmakers investigated over pocketing millions of dollars in proceeds from political fundraisers. It angered the public so much and cost party its majority in the 2024 election.\\nThe timing of the election has drawn criticism from opposition parties. They argue the snap vote has delayed anti-inflation measures, postponed debate over the fiscal 2026 budget, and placed an additional administrative burden on local municipalities.\\nHall says the primary motivation behind the timing was parliamentary arithmetic.\\n\"The main purpose of calling the snap election when she did was to get back a parliamentary majority so that the new budget committee will be chaired by the LDP or a coalition partner,\" he says, allowing the budget to pass \"without opposition scrutiny\".\\nThe vote also comes in the depths of winter. Parts of northern Japan have been hit by heavy snow, raising concerns that bad weather could affect turnout.\\nLast year\\'s miscalculation also looms large over the ruling party. When Shigeru Ishiba called a snap election shortly after taking office, it backfired spectacularly, delivering one of the LDP\\'s worst results in decades and costing the party its Lower House majority.\\n\"When Ishiba called the election, the public was angry,\" Nakano says.\\n\"There were financial scandals hanging over the LDP, and cost-of-living pressures were acute. This time, she has successfully distanced herself from that image.\"\\nStill, Nakano calls the strategy high-risk. \"She\\'s created popularity by dissociating herself from the party\\'s stagnant image,\" he says.\\n\"But elections are about parties, not just personalities. That\\'s the danger.\"\\nSince taking office, Takaichi has been on a diplomatic roll, but she has also managed to infuriate Japan\\'s biggest trading partner, China.\\nRelations have deteriorated sharply after her comments suggesting Japan could respond militarily if China attacked Taiwan, remarks she has refused to retract.\\nThe dispute escalated rapidly. Both sides lodged formal protests. Japan warned its citizens to stay safe in China, while Beijing urged its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan.\\nDomestically, the row has strengthened Takaichi\\'s standing.\\n\"She is a hawk… a conservative,\" says 85-year-old voter Naoaki Yuhara.\\n\"Of course, the economy is an important issue for the people, but at my age -especially when I think about my grandchildren\\'s generation - national defence is very important, and she is seriously thinking about it.\"\\nBut Takaichi\\'s hawkishness on defence worries Haruka, a voter in her 30s.\\n\"I am concerned about the defence issue. We don\\'t know where exactly the money is being spent or how. I do worry that they may spend money on things like nuclear weapons or the use of military forces,\" she told the BBC.\\n\"I worry that it may be happening behind our backs without our knowledge. Perhaps we\\'re heading towards a future where we might have no choice but to engage in some sort of conflict.\"\\nRintaro Nishimura also warns that this hawkish stance could backfire in the long run. \"With a mandate, people expect her to be more hawkish on China. But prolonged tension could hurt the economy and that would hurt her approval.\"\\nKoichi Nakano warns that public debate about the China spat has all but disappeared. \"There is a general taboo in the media… sensible discussions about how to coexist with China can get easily branded as appeasement,\" he says.\\n\"The real economic and security consequences of burning bridges with China are not really being discussed.\"\\nSanae Takaichi is expected to visit Washington shortly after the elections to meet Donald Trump ahead of his summit with China\\'s President Xi Jinping and amid Tokyo\\'s very tense relationship with Beijing.\\n\"Japan might get isolated without getting the support from Trump,\" Nakano warns, \"while it doesn\\'t look anywhere near like a possibility that she\\'ll be able to mend ties with Xi Jinping.\"\\nWhile concern over financial scandals appears to have faded, cost-of-living pressures remain front of mind.\\nThe sharp spike in rice prices in mid-2025 shocked households. Though it occurred before Takaichi took office, it continues to shape perceptions of the LDP.\\nInflation slowed in late 2025, but wages remain stagnant and the yen has weakened further.\\n\"I used to spend about 10,000 yen ($64; £47) a week on groceries,\" Kanako Himura says.\\n\"Now it\\'s always more. Prices are rising, quantities are shrinking. Even when the price stays the same, you get less.\"\\n\"Tokyo property prices are too high,\" says Kento Naka, a 35-year-old manga artist.\\n\"Paper books cost about one-and-a-half times more now. Everything else too. But income hasn\\'t caught up at all.\"\\nTakaichi has promised public spending, inflation relief and tax cuts, but critics say the details remain vague.\\n\"The reality is the cost of living is probably going to keep going up, and salaries are going to remain low… and that\\'s one of the reasons why Takaichi is calling this early election,\" Hall said.\\n\"She\\'s probably figured out the economy is not going to be an easy fix. If she waits longer, people will start blaming her for the economy, as they blamed previous prime ministers.\"\\nOther long-held priorities have also faded from her campaign, including weapons exports, an anti-espionage law and immigration reform. This tactic, observers say, is less about policy and more about keeping her high position in the polls.\\nDespite a newly formed centrist alliance between the Constitutional Democratic Party and former LDP coalition partner Komeito, polls suggest the opposition remains fragmented.\\n\"The Komeito vote had been propping up the LDP for years,\" Jeffrey Hall says.\\n\"Now the LDP is propping itself up using the popularity of the prime minister.\"\\nRintaro Nishimura says the election has been framed as a choice between certainty and the unknown. \"There\\'s not a lot of precedent for an opposition-led government,\" he says. \"That\\'s always in the back of voters\\' minds.\"\\nThe far-right Sanseito party has sharpened debate on immigration, but Jeffrey Hall says Takaichi\\'s rise has blunted its momentum.\\n\"One of the reasons the LDP picked Takaichi is that she is a hard-line conservative,\" he says. \"They were hoping she would draw nationalists back from Sanseito.\"\\nBut the prime minister faces a tough act balancing an ageing society reluctant to receive immigrants and an economy that would not sustain without them.\\n\"Japan has a major labour shortage. Foreign workers are now vital to many sectors of the economy,\" he says. \"If she doesn\\'t want the economy to get worse, she will continue increasing immigration.\"\\nThe dark cloud of the economy will hover over whoever takes office. If the prime minister does secure a majority, the stagnant wages, the weak yen and cost of living will be her most immediate and biggest challenges.\\n\"There will be at least a brief honeymoon period,\" Koichi Nakano says. \"But the reality of the economy will hit very quickly.\"\\n'},\n",

He, however, says it is not yet clear how many more workers might be trapped underground.\\nThe police are yet to identify the people who owned and operated the mine, while a case has been registered against unidentified people, Kumar says. They are also yet to ascertain identities of the victims.\\n\"Accountability will be fixed, and those responsible will face strict legal action,\" Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said in a statement.\\nSome locals, who say they had interacted with the miners recently, told reporters that most of those killed were from the neighbouring state of Assam.\\nAssam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said: \"If this is established, we will extend all possible assistance and support to the affected families from Assam.\"\\nThe blast is among the deadliest mining accidents in Meghalaya in recent years.

Takaichi described Trump as a \"partner in a new golden era\", and praised his role in bringing peace to the Middle East.\\n\"In my visit to Japan, I and all of my representatives, were extremely impressed with her,\" Trump wrote in his Truth Social post on Thursday, noting that the two countries have made progress in national security cooperation and on the economic front.\\nTrump also said he would welcome Takaichi to the White House on 19 March.\\n\\nHis post, which signals that Takaichi is a leader his administration would work with, is a message aimed not only at Japanese voters but also the region, and especially China.\\nBeijing and Tokyo are in the middle of a diplomatic rift, and the historically tense relationship has hit its lowest point in more than a decade.\\nTakaichi found herself the target of China\\'s ire in November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan, the self-governed island it has long claimed. She has since refused to retract the statement.\\nTrump\\'s endorsement of her comes as tensions between them continue, and a day after he had a phone call with China\\'s leader Xi Jinping.\\nHe said he had an \"extremely good\" relationship with China, and that both he and Xi \"realise how important it is to keep it that way\".\\nXi called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" in their relationship, emphasising that Taiwan was \"China\\'s territory\", Chinese state media reported. He also told Trump that Washington should be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the self-governed island which China has long claimed.\\nPolls so far are predicting a landslide for Takaichi but winning Sunday\\'s election will just be the first of several hurdles.\\nHer leadership will be defined by how she manages Japan\\'s stagnant economy and the delicate relationship with the US, its most critical security ally, as well as China, its largest trading partner.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'One night in 2023, Eric was scrolling on a social media channel he regularly browsed for porn. Seconds into a video, he froze.\\nHe realised the couple he was watching - entering the room, setting down their bags, and later, having sex - was himself and his girlfriend. Three weeks earlier, they had spent the night in a hotel in Shenzhen, southern China, unaware that they were not alone.\\nTheir most intimate moments had been captured by a camera hidden in their hotel room, and the footage made available to thousands of strangers who had logged in to the channel Eric himself used to access pornography.\\nEric (not his real name) was no longer just a consumer of China\\'s spy-cam porn industry, but a victim.\\nWarning: This story contains some offensive language\\nSo-called spy-cam porn has existed in China for at least a decade, despite the fact that producing and distributing porn is illegal in the country.\\nBut in the past couple of years the issue has become a regular talking point on social media, with people - particularly women - swapping tips on how to spot cameras as small as a pencil eraser. Some have even resorted to pitching tents inside hotel rooms to avoid being filmed.\\nLast April, new government regulations attempted to stem this epidemic - requiring hotel owners to check regularly for hidden cameras.\\nBut the threat of being secretly filmed in the privacy of a hotel room has not gone away. The BBC World Service has found thousands of recent spy-cam videos filmed in hotel rooms and sold as porn, on multiple sites.\\nOutside the UK, watch the film on YouTube or listen to the Podcast here\\nMuch of the material is advertised on the messaging and social media app Telegram. Over 18 months, I discovered six different websites and apps promoted on Telegram. Between them these claimed to operate more than 180 hotel-room spy-cams which were not just capturing, but livestreaming, hotel guests\\' activities.\\nI monitored one of these websites regularly for seven months and found content captured by 54 different cameras, with about half operational at any one time.\\nThat means thousands of guests could have been filmed over that period, the BBC estimates, based on typical occupancy rates. Most are unlikely to know they have been captured on camera.\\nEric, from Hong Kong, began watching secretly filmed videos as a teenager, attracted by how \"raw\" the footage was.\\n\"What drew me in is the fact that the people don\\'t know they\\'re being filmed,\" says Eric, now in his 30s. \"I think traditional porn feels very staged, very fake.\"\\nBut he experienced what it feels like to be at the opposite end of the supply chain when he found the video of himself and his girlfriend \"Emily\" - and he no longer finds gratification in this content.\\nWhen he broke the news to Emily that their hotel stay had been filmed, edited into an hour-long clip, and uploaded to Telegram, she thought he was joking. But then she saw the footage for herself and was mortified.\\nEmily was terrified the clip could have been seen by colleagues and family. The couple didn\\'t talk to each other for weeks.\\nSo how does the industry - which exploits unsuspecting couples\\' intimate sexual acts for voyeuristic paying customers - work, and who is behind it?\\nOne of the most prominent spy-cam porn traders I came across was an agent known as \"AKA\".\\nPosing as a consumer, I paid to access one of the livestreaming websites promoted by him - for a monthly fee of 450 Yuan ($65, £47).\\nOnce logged in, I had the option to choose between five different filming feeds, each showing several hotel rooms - visible as soon as a guest triggered the electricity supply by inserting their key card. It was also possible to rewind livestreams from the start, and download archived clips.\\nOn Telegram - banned in China but commonly used for illicit activity - AKA advertised these livestreams. One Telegram channel had as many as 10,000 members during the course of our investigation.\\nLibraries of his edited livestream clips are also available on Telegram for a flat fee. I could see more than 6,000 videos in the archive, dating back to 2017.\\nAKA\\'s subscribers comment in Telegram\\'s channel function, as they watch unsuspecting hotel guests - judging their appearance, gossiping about their conversations, and appraising their sexual performance.\\nThey celebrate when a couple starts having sex - and complain if they switch the lights off, shrouding them in darkness. Women are regularly described as \"sluts\", \"whores\" and \"bitches\".\\nWe managed to trace one of the spy-cams to a hotel room in Zhengzhou, central China, through piecing together several clues, from subscribers, social media users, and our own research.\\nResearchers on the ground were able to access the room, and found the camera - lens pointed at the bed - hidden in the wall ventilation unit and wired into the building\\'s electricity supply.\\nA hidden-camera detector, widely sold online as a \"must-have\" for hotel guests, gave no warning they were being spied on.\\nThe team disabled the secret camera and word spread quickly on Telegram.\\n\"Zhonghua [name of the camera] got taken down!\" one subscriber wrote on the main channel managed by AKA.\\n\"It\\'s such a shame; that room has the best sound quality!\" AKA responded in the chat.\\nBut the complaints turned to celebration when, within hours, AKA posted that a replacement camera in a different hotel had been activated.\\n\"This is the speed of… [our livestreaming platform],\" AKA told his subscribers. \"Impressive right?\"\\nDuring our 18-month investigation we identified about a dozen agents like AKA.\\nThe exchanges they had with subscribers made it clear they were working for others higher up the supply chain, who they referred to as \"camera owners\". These people, the agents\\' comments suggested, arranged the spy-cam installation and managed the livestreaming platforms.\\nDuring our direct messaging with AKA, he accidentally shared a screenshot of a message from someone he said was a \"camera owner\", with the profile name \"Brother Chun\".\\nAKA quickly deleted the message, and refused to discuss it, but we managed to contact \"Brother Chun\" directly. Despite our evidence that he supplied the livestreaming website to AKA, Brother Chun claimed he was just another sales agent, although he did seem to acknowledge the supply chain extended beyond people like himself.\\nWhat is clear is there are significant sums of money to be made. Based on channel membership and subscription fees, the BBC estimates AKA alone has earned at least 163,200 Yuan ($22,000, £16,300) since last April. The average annual income in China last year was 43,377 Yuan ($6,200, £4,600) according to China\\'s Bureau of Statistics.\\nThere are strict rules on selling and using spy-cams in China, but we found it relatively easy to buy one in the country\\'s largest electronics market in Huaqiangbei.\\nAccurate figures on how many people have been brought before the courts for spy-cam porn are more difficult to find. China\\'s authorities have shared far fewer legal case details in recent years, but the cases we found ranged the length of China - from Jilin province in the north, to Guangdong in the far south.\\nBlue Li, from a Hong Kong-based NGO called RainLily - which helps victims remove explicit secretly-filmed footage from the internet - says demand is rising for her group\\'s services, but the task is proving more difficult.\\nTelegram never responds to RainLily\\'s requests for removal, she says, forcing them to contact group administrators - the very people selling or sharing spy-cam pornography - who have little incentive to respond.\\n\"We believe tech companies share the huge responsibility in addressing these problems. Because these companies are not neutral platforms; their policies shape how the content would be spread,\" Li says.\\nThe BBC itself told Telegram, via its report function, that AKA and Brother Chun - and the groups they managed - were sharing spy-cam porn via its platforms, but it did not respond or take any action.\\nContacted again 10 days later, with the BBC\\'s full investigation findings, Telegram told us: \"Sharing non-consensual pornography is explicitly forbidden by Telegram\\'s terms of service\" and \"it proactively moderates… and accepts reports [of inappropriate content] in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.\"\\nWe formally set out our findings to Brother Chun and AKA that they were profiting from exploiting unsuspecting hotel guests. They did not reply, but hours later the Telegram accounts they used to advertise the content appeared to have been deleted. However the website that AKA sold me access to is still livestreaming hotel guests.\\nEric and Emily remain traumatised by their experience. They always wear hats in public in case they are recognised and try to avoid staying in hotels. Eric no longer uses these Telegram channels to watch porn, he says, but still checks them occasionally - terrified the clip could resurface.\\nAdditional reporting by Cate Brown, Bridget Wing and Mengyu Dong\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'In one of India\\'s coldest and most remote regions, a group of women have taken on an unlikely role: protecting one of Asia\\'s most elusive predators, the snow leopard.\\nSnow leopards are found in just 12 countries across Central and South Asia. India is home to one of the world\\'s largest populations, with a nationwide survey in 2023 - the first comprehensive count ever carried out in the country - estimating more than 700 animals, .\\nOne of the places they roam is around Kibber village in Himachal Pradesh state\\'s Spiti Valley, a stark, high-altitude cold desert along the Himalayan belt. Here, snow leopards are often called the \"ghosts of the mountains\", slipping silently across rocky slopes and rarely revealing themselves.\\nFor generations, the animals were seen largely as a threat, for attacking livestock. But attitudes in Kibber and neighbouring villages are beginning to shift, as people increasingly recognise the snow leopard\\'s role as a top predator in the food chain and its importance in maintaining the region\\'s fragile mountain ecosystem.\\nNearly a dozen local women are now working alongside the Himachal Pradesh forest department and conservationists to track and protect the species, playing a growing role in conservation efforts.\\nLocally, the snow leopard is known as Shen and the women call their group \"Shenmo\". Trained to install and monitor camera traps, they handle devices fitted with unique IDs and memory cards that automatically photograph snow leopards as they pass.\\n\"Earlier, men used to go and install the cameras and we kept wondering why couldn\\'t we do it too,\" says Lobzang Yangchen, a local coordinator working with a small group supported by the non-profit Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) in collaboration with the forest department.\\nYangchen was among the women who helped collect data for Himachal Pradesh\\'s snow leopard survey in 2024, which found that the state was home to 83 snow leopards - up from 51 in 2021.\\nThe survey documented snow leopards and 43 other species using camera traps spread across an area of nearly 26,000sq km (10,000sq miles). Individual leopards were identified by the unique rosette patterns on their fur, a standard technique used for spotted big cats. The findings are now feeding into wider conservation and habitat-management plans.\\n\"Their contribution was critical to identifying individual animals,\" says Goldy Chhabra, deputy conservator of forests with the Spiti Wildlife Division.\\nCollecting the data is demanding work. Most of it takes place in winter, when heavy snowfall pushes snow leopards and their prey to lower altitudes, making their routes easier to track.\\nOn survey days, the women wake up early, finish household chores and gather at a base camp before travelling by vehicle as far as the terrain allows. From there, they trek several kilometres to reach camera sites, often at altitudes above 14,000ft (4,300m), where the thin air makes even simple movement exhausting.\\nThe BBC accompanied the group on one such trek in December. After hours of walking in biting cold, the women suddenly stopped on a narrow trail.\\nYangchen points to pugmarks in the dust: \"This shows the snow leopard has been here recently. These pugmarks are fresh.\"\\nAlong with pugmarks, the team looks for other signs, including scrapes and scent‑marking spots, before carefully fixing a camera to a rock along the trail.\\nOne woman then carries out a \"walk test\", crawling along the path to check whether the camera\\'s height and angle will capture a clear image.\\nThe group then moves on to older sites, retrieving memory cards and replacing batteries installed weeks earlier.\\nBy mid-afternoon, they return to camp to log and analyse the images using specialised software - tools many had never encountered before.\\n\"I studied only until grade five,\" says Chhering Lanzom. \"At first, I was scared to use the computer. But slowly, we learned how to use the keyboard and mouse.\"\\nThe women joined the camera-trapping programme in 2023. Initially, conservation was not their motivation. But winters in the Spiti Valley are long and quiet, with little agricultural work to fall back on.\\n\"At first, this work on snow leopards didn\\'t interest us,\" Lobzang says. \"We joined because we were curious and we could earn a small income.\"\\nThe women earn between 500 ($5.46; £4) and 700 rupees a day.\\nBut beyond the money, the work has helped transform how the community views the animal.\\n\"Earlier, we thought the snow leopard was our enemy,\" says Dolma Zangmo, a local resident. \"Now we think their conservation is important.\"\\nAlongside survey work, the women help villagers access government insurance schemes for their livestock and promote the use of predator‑proof corrals - stone or mesh enclosures that protect animals at night.\\nTheir efforts come at a time of growing recognition for the region. Spiti Valley has recently been included in the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve, a Unesco-recognised network aimed at conserving fragile ecosystems while supporting local livelihoods.\\nAs climate change reshapes the fragile trans-Himalayan landscape, conservationists say such community participation will be crucial to safeguarding species like the snow leopard.\\n\"Once communities are involved, conservation becomes more sustainable,\" says Deepshikha Sharma, programme manager with NCF\\'s High Altitudes initiative.\\n\"These women are not just assisting, they are becoming practitioners of wildlife conservation and monitoring,\" she adds.\\nAs for the women, their work makes them feel closer to their home, the village and the mountains that raised them, they say.\\n\"We were born here, this is all we know,\" Lobzang says. \"Sometimes we feel afraid because these snow leopards are after all predatory animals, but this is where we belong.\"\\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Suttasitt \"Macky\" Pottasak is a typical candidate of Thailand\\'s People\\'s Party: young, idealistic and hardworking.\\nHe gave up a career in TV drama production in Bangkok to run in the last election, winning a rural seat near his home city of Nakhon Ratchasima from an old, established political family. He has adopted the hat and flag of Luffy, the main character in the Japanese anime series One Piece, which has featured in recent youth protests in Asia. He makes light-hearted videos about his party\\'s policies every day, which are getting millions of views on social media.\\n\"Politics is something past generations made boring. I want to make it fun,\" he says. \"That\\'s why I brought in Luffy and my video mini-series. We don\\'t have money to buy votes. We are just ordinary citizens, but with a strong determination to solve the long-standing problems. I think the villagers can see that.\"\\nOpinion polls suggest that much of the Thai public agrees with the People\\'s Party. They are polling consistently ahead of their rivals as the election on Sunday draws near.\\nBut in Thailand, winning an election is never enough.\\nThe last one, less than three years ago, produced a surprise win for the progressive Move Forward party, which had campaigned on promises of root-and-branch political and economic reforms. These included making Thailand\\'s powerful military, and its largest businesses, more accountable, and reducing the heavy punishments under the notorious lese majeste law.\\nBut powerful conservative forces, in particular the unelected senate and the constitutional court, blocked Move Forward from forming a government, dissolved the party and banned its leaders from politics. The court ruled that its proposals for the lese majeste law amounted to an attempt to overthrow the entire political system.\\nNow, after three tumultuous years of short-lived coalition administrations, the sacking of two prime ministers by the constitutional court and a border war with Cambodia, the reformists are making another bid for power, this time under a new name, the People\\'s Party.\\nTheir youthful energy and idealism still draw large and excited crowds. At a rally in Nakhon Ratchasima the new party leader, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, a 38-year-old former software engineer, was mobbed like a rock star, people queueing for selfies with him and wrapping him in garlands of flowers.\\nMacky and two assistants tour his constituency on e-scooters, passing irrigation canals, rice fields and the simple wooden houses characteristic of north-eastern Thai villages, listening to the concerns of the residents. They tell a story of a society under acute economic stress, where the old engines of growth have stopped working.\\nThe village head La-or Kohsantea says there are few decent jobs in the area, so young people have to leave to find work. \"No-one has helped us with the problem of poverty,\" she says. Thailand has one of the highest levels of household debt in Asia. GDP is growing at less than 2% a year, far lower than neighbouring countries.\\nKritsana Lohsantea, 28, is asking Macky to help him get a modest social security payment when the electronics factory he works at closes down later this year.\\nLike many young Thais in rural areas he left school at 15 with few qualifications, but the low-skilled manufacturing jobs which helped Thailand grow rapidly 30 or 40 years ago are now moving to lower-cost locations like Vietnam.\\nMacky has also noticed how many elderly people there are in the area. Thailand\\'s population has been falling for five years. Last year the number of births fell 10 %, the highest rate in the world.\\nWith so many young people leaving the village, Macky is proposing local training and a better online system for organising care-givers, to look after house-bound old people who no longer have family members living with them.\\nThe People\\'s Party stands out for its ambition to transform Thailand.\\nIt has prioritised amending the constitution, which was drafted under military rule and gives a lot of power to unelected agencies like the constitutional court to constrain elected governments. The party wants to streamline the country\\'s extensive bureaucracy, modernise its education system, and curb the power of the military and the biggest businesses. It also supports amending the military-drafted constitution, a question which will be put in a referendum at the same time as the election.\\nIts two main rivals, Bhumjaithai, the party of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, and Pheu Thai, the party of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, have focused instead on more crowd-pleasing policies.\\nAnutin has highlighted his nationalist credentials, pointing to the hard line he took against Cambodia in the border war, and his support for the military.\\n\"I promise you I will protect our soil with my life,\" he told the crowd at a rally in Bangkok. \"If you want a prime minister the enemy cannot intimidate, choose my party.\"\\nHe has also persuaded many MPs from other parties to defect to him, and recruited technocrats known for their competence, to build Bhumjaithai up into a leading conservative political force.\\nPheu Thai, which built its past popularity on eye-catching populist policies has promised to create nine new millionaires – in Thai baht – every day through a national prize draw. Both parties are offering subsidies and cash handouts, but many economists argue this kind of instant help does little so solve the deep structural problems confronting Thailand.\\n\"This is barking up the wrong tree,\" says Apichat Satitniramai, a professor of economics at Thammasat University. \"These stimulus packages are like painkillers, which are less effective the more we use them.\"\\nIn his view the People\\'s Party is the only one thinking long-term, rather than just about what is needed to win the election.\\nFrom the moment the People\\'s Party was founded in 2017, then called Future Forward, by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a charismatic and wealthy entrepreneur, it was viewed as a threat by powerful conservative figures.\\nThailand was under military rule at the time. The then-army chief compared the party to the armed communist insurgency of the Cold War. Some feared Thanathorn\\'s argument that everything in Thailand needed reforming, might eventually include the monarchy, which conservatives say must be untouchable.\\nAfter the party\\'s surprisingly strong performance in the 2019 election, the constitutional court, which had already disqualified other parties and politicians seen as a threat to the status quo, barred Thanathorn from political office for 10 years. This was over his ownership of shares in a small publishing company, which was judged to violate rules against politicians controlling news media.\\nFuture Forward was dissolved by the court the following year, a verdict which ignited large-scale student protests that lasted until the end of the year, and for the first time, called for reform of the monarchy.\\nBy the time of the next election in 2023 the public hunger for change was even greater, delivering the successor party, Move Forward, its unexpected win, followed by the almost inevitable dissolution.\\nSo, all eyes are on what happens after voting this weekend. If, as the polls suggest, the People\\'s Party gets even more seats than last time, it will be well ahead of its closest rival, though the polls show none of the parties getting an overall majority of the 500 seats in parliament. This time the senate is no longer allowed to take part in choosing the next government.\\nYet everyone in Thailand expects some kind of move to block the People\\'s Party once again. A case has been filed against 44 of its leading figures - including 15 of their parliamentary candidates - with the National Anti-Corruption Commission, over their personal endorsement of the lese majeste proposals.\\nThat could be used to bar them all from politics. Two of their candidates are also facing jail time under that law.\\n\"They are afraid of us,\" Thanathorn told the BBC, as he prepared to join a People\\'s Party campaign bus. \"They are afraid of change. They want tomorrow to be just like yesterday. They think dissolving our parties, banning our leaders from politics, would make us smaller.\\n\"In fact, we are getting bigger.\"\\nEven if his party is allowed to join a government, the constraints on what they can do in office remain in place. That is why they have made reforming the constitution such a high priority, to dilute or end the extraordinary powers that deeply conservative institutions like the constitutional court have to unseat elected governments.\\nIn that they are joined by rival party Pheu Thai, which saw two of its prime ministers removed from office by the court during their two years in power. But there are many hurdles to getting a new charter. The process could take years, or it could easily be blocked.\\n\"If Thailand was a functional democracy, none of this would have happened,\" says Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University.\\n\"We have regular elections, sometimes punctuated by military coups. But elections only determine the representatives in the lower house of parliament. They do not determine who governs. That is determined by elite networks, and unelected institutions which have played a veto role against the will of the voters.\"\\n'},\n",

Gandhi was repeatedly interrupted as he tried to read excerpts from the book in a debate on Monday.\\nHe later said the memoir claimed that as Chinese tanks advanced at Indian positions, Naravane was told \"to do what he deemed appropriate\".\\nIndia and China clashed along their disputed Himalayan border in the summer of 2020 in the Galwan river valley in Ladakh, marking their first fatal confrontation since 1975.\\nTensions eased in 2024 after years of military and diplomatic negotiations, with both sides agreeing to disengage in affected border areas.\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s BJP party accused Gandhi of insulting Indian soldiers and breaking parliamentary rules by trying to read from an unpublished book. Naravane is yet to comment on the furore.\\nHis memoir has been making headlines in India since the weekend after The Caravan magazine published an essay containing passages that it said were excerpts from the unreleased manuscript.\\nThe BBC has not seen the manuscript and cannot independently verify the excerpts. It has contacted Naravane and his publisher, Penguin Random House, for comment.\\nOn Monday, Gandhi tried to read passages from a photocopy of the article during a discussion in the lower house of parliament.\\n\"This is about when four Chinese tanks were entering Indian territory,\" he said, before he was stopped from speaking further.\\nParliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said he told leaders from the Congress party that Gandhi could continue his speech. \"However, what the former army chief did not say, what is not true, and what is not permitted under the rules should not be forced upon the house,\" he added.\\nThis wasn\\'t the first time the Congress leader had criticised the government over China.\\nHe has repeatedly accused the Modi government of \"giving away\" Indian territory to China during the 2020 standoff. The government has strongly rejected the allegations, insisting no land was lost.\\nIn parliament on Monday, Gandhi\\'s comments about Naravane\\'s memoir were interrupted by members of the BJP, including Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah, who accused him of violating parliamentary rules by quoting from an unpublished book and misleading the house.\\nThe defence minister said \"Rahul Gandhi should present before the house the book he is quoting from, because the book he is referring to has not been published\".\\nGandhi insisted that his source was \"authentic\" and that he was entitled to quote from it. The noisy exchanges between the governing and opposition benches led to proceedings being adjourned for the day on Monday.\\nBut disruptions continued on Tuesday, when Gandhi attempted to raise the issue again in the house. He was stopped again, sparking fresh protests from opposition leaders. Eight Congress MPs were later suspended for disorderly conduct.\\nOn Wednesday, Gandhi held up a copy of the unpublished book to reporters outside parliament, saying Singh\\'s statement that the book did not exist was untrue.\\nHe quoted from the book to say that \"the standing order was not to fire upon Chinese troops if they entered Indian territory without asking the top leadership\".\\nWhen the former army chief repeatedly called Rajnath Singh, he relayed a message from Modi effectively leaving the decision to Naravane, he said.\\n\"I felt really alone.

Seeing him sprawled on the ground, Hossain began dragging him away, but police kept shooting. Hossain felt a bullet strike his own leg.\\n\"I had to leave him behind,\" Hossain says. Bhuiyan was later declared dead in hospital.\\nViolence like this became the catalyst that turned student-led demonstrations into a mass protest nationwide, with its epicentre in the capital, Dhaka. Within a fortnight, the government had been swept from power, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fleeing the country.\\nUp to 1,400 people died during the protests, the vast majority killed in the security crackdown ordered by Hasina, according to the United Nations.\\nHasina\\'s downfall seemed to promise a new age. The uprising was considered the first and most successful of a series of Gen Z protests around the world.\\nSome student leaders in Bangladesh went on to hold key posts in an interim government, trying to shape the kind of country they had taken to the streets to fight for. They were expected to play a role in the country\\'s future administration, after decades of rule by Hasina\\'s Awami League and the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).\\nBut as general elections loom next week, the students\\' newly formed political party is badly fractured and women in the movement largely sidelined. With the Awami League banned, other long-established parties are filling the vacuum.\\nHossain joined the 2024 student-led demonstrations - which brought together young men and women, secular and religious - initially to protest against new quotas in civil service jobs, but kept going as they morphed into \"a single shared objective\" to end \"autocratic rule\".\\nHowever, the interim government has failed to produce the \"beautiful Bangladesh based on peace, equality, justice and fairness\" he had hoped for, he told the BBC.\\nHe isn\\'t alone in feeling the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) is too inexperienced. Instead, he\\'s impressed by another, much older party: Jamaat-e-Islami.\\nIt\\'s an Islamist party which has served as a minor coalition partner, but gained momentum of its own in the run-up to the 12 February election, from which the Awami League is banned.\\nEstablished in 1941, Jamaat has always been dogged by its stance during Bangladesh\\'s 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed, and more than 10 million fled their homes. Some of Jamaat\\'s politicians were accused of collaborating with then West Pakistan.\\nBut that history does not seem to bother Hossain, who believes Jamaat has modernised.\\n\"Jamaat supported the comrades of the July uprising and the students in various ways,\" he explains.\\nJamaat\\'s leader Shafiqur Rahman told the BBC the party is pledging to end corruption and restore the judiciary\\'s independence - claims that will be hard to deliver in a country with historically high levels of corruption, but which have resonated with many.\\nProfessor Tawfique Haque of North South University in Dhaka says most younger voters, born long after 1971, can separate Jamaat from its history and don\\'t see it as a red line.\\n\"It\\'s a generational issue,\" he says, arguing they don\\'t want to be \"bogged down with this debate\".\\nInstead, younger voters have seen the party as a fellow victim of Hasina\\'s rule, according to Haque, banned from politics and many of its politicians in jail.\\nHossain is not the only one turning to Jamaat: candidates backed by the party\\'s student wing won a landslide during student elections at Bangladesh\\'s top universities last September, in a vote seen as a bellwether of the national mood.\\nNotably, it was the first time since independence that an Islamist party had won control of the student union at Bangladesh\\'s prestigious Dhaka University.\\nIt was also the first major sign of trouble for the student leaders, in a country where about four in 10 voters are under 37.\\nThe lack of faith in the NCP is a major blow to the student leaders.\\n\"We were hoping to do a lot better,\" admits Asif Mahmud, 27, a former adviser to the interim government, and now chairman of the NCP\\'s Election Committee.\\nBut, he argues, the odds were stacked against them: \"Only two parties have led Bangladesh for the last 50 years… we are trying to prove ourselves.\"\\nSo the NCP made a choice. In December, they announced a multi-party alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami.\\nLike Jamaat, the NCP has promised to root out corruption. Its manifesto has other pledges aimed at younger voters: justice for families of those killed in the uprising, lowering the voting age to 16, and job creation through tax and economic reform.\\nMahmud argues the NCP needed help from Jamaat\\'s grassroots operation, even if they disagree on certain issues. \"We have always said we are not an Islamist party,\" he said, \"This is not an ideological alliance.\"\\nBut of the 30 candidates Jamaat is allowing the NCP to field, only two are women. Jamaat is fielding more than 200 candidates, all of them men.\\nThat\\'s a compromise senior female members of the NCP like Tasnim Jara have called a \"moral red line\", and why she and several others have resigned from the party.\\n\"They wanted to sideline us,\" says Shima Akhter, a 25-year-old student who helped lead the protests.\\nDespite women playing a leading role in the uprising, Shima argues the interim government under Muhammad Yunus is still mostly dominated by men.\\n\"Where are the women?\"\\nAfter the uprising, Shima and other women activists were targeted in social media posts.\\n\"Some meme videos were so violent and so frustrating,\" she recalls. \"We were slut shamed, trolled.\"\\nVideos began circulating of them, belittling their intelligence, claiming their marriage prospects were destroyed, and some even attacked Shima for the colour of her skin.\\nBoth parties deny sidelining women, instead claiming the numbers of women standing is a result of Bangladesh\\'s \"social structure\". Jamaat\\'s Shafiqur Rahman added that he hoped that would change.\\nShima dismisses that as \"just a patriarchal excuse\".\\nShe is leaning towards the BNP, which is fielding 10 women out of more than 250 candidates. \"Better than bad,\" she says.\\nThe NCP\\'s lack of support, together with the ban on the Awami League, is also benefiting the BNP, which has rebranded itself as a liberal democratic force.\\nAfter seeing thousands of supporters and senior members jailed under Awami rule, the BNP is now the largest party contending - and is further squeezing the student party.\\nLike the Awami League – whose leader Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, considered the country\\'s founder - the BNP is tied to a political dynasty.\\nIts new leader Tarique Rahman is the son of the late Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh\\'s first female prime minister. Zia herself came to power after her husband, a former president, was assassinated in a military coup.\\n\"Whether you come from a dynasty or not is irrelevant,\" former BNP commerce minister, now candidate, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury told the BBC.\\nIronically, this dynastic cycle enduring is only possible thanks to the student-led uprising, following which Rahman was able to return after 17 years in self-imposed exile. Hasina\\'s exit allowed both him and his mother to be acquitted of corruption charges they maintained were politically motivated.\\nHe has criticised Jamaat for using religious sentiment to win votes, and is promising economic and democratic reforms, as well as a \"rainbow nation\", where a new \"National Reconciliation Commission\" would help the country move past its divisions.\\nHasina governed Bangladesh for 15 years, overseeing economic progress, but increasingly attempting to silence opposition, with politically-motivated arrests, disappearances and extra-judicial killings. She was sentenced to death for the crackdown in 2024 by Bangladesh\\'s war crimes tribunal last year.\\nFrom exile, she has denounced the ban on her party. Many other senior Awami leaders are also sheltering in India with her. Some are under arrest back home.\\nThe BBC spoke to a district leader for the party in hiding, and he said: \"By excluding the Awami League, a free and fair election is not possible.\"\\nShould Sheikh Hasina order it, the party and its supporters would \"resist\" the elections, he warned. \"If she decides that people should not go to polling centres, then we will not go. If she says the election must be obstructed, then we will obstruct the election.\"\\nHe called accusations by independent human rights organisations of politically motivated arrests and extrajudicial killings during their time in power \"false\" and \"fabricated\".\\nAfter the vote next week, students will learn whether their revolution, and the bloodshed, were worth it.\\nSitting by Dhaka\\'s Jatrabari flyover where he lost his friend, Hossain is still waiting to see the trial against all police officers conclude.\\nBhuiyan\\'s own father is a police officer. When he identified his son\\'s body, he called a senior officer in the force and asked: \"Sir, how many bullets does it take to kill a boy?\"\\nHossain says he\\'s still haunted by the day his friend was shot.\\nHe watched the video eight days later, when the country\\'s internet had been restored. \"My entire screaming voice can be heard… I cried endlessly.\"\\nA year later, he celebrated the first anniversary of Hasina\\'s ousting on 5 August, alongside his other \"comrades of the uprising\".\\nBut Hossain admits their \"new Bangladesh\" is not here yet.

       "  'Article': 'Black, crispy, often flat and square - dried seaweed, known locally as gim - is a humble staple on everyday dining tables across South Korea. But as its global popularity grows, its rising prices are worrying gim-lovers nationwide.\\nLee Hyang-ran has been selling gim for the past 47 years.\\n\"In the past, people from Western countries thought Koreans were eating something weird that looks like a piece of black paper,\" the vendor, who is in her 60s, says from a small market stall in central Seoul.\\n\"I never thought I\\'d be selling gim to them. But now, they all come here and buy it.\"\\nSouth Korea is known to be the world\\'s largest producer and exporter of gim, supplying markets across Asia, North America and Europe. Some even refer to the product as Korea\\'s \"black semiconductor\", a reference to South Korea\\'s large share of the global semiconductor industry.\\nExports have risen steadily in recent years - and in 2025, South Korea\\'s dried seaweed exports hit a record $1.13bn, according to the Korea Maritime Institute (KMI).\\nAnd as demand rises, so do prices.\\nKnown locally as an affordable snack or ingredient, gim typically cost around 100 won ($0.06; £0.05) per sheet in 2024 - with the snack usually sold in bundles of 10 sheets or more, or around $0.60 per pack.\\nBut last month, the price of one sheet of gim rose to above 150 won - a record high in the country.\\n\"Premium products now cost as much as 350 won per sheet,\" said Lee.\\nKim Jaela, who\\'s in her 30s, typically buys gim in bulk - about 500 small sheets at a time, enough to last her several months.\\nBut she says this may need to change, considering how expensive gim has become.\\nShe does most of her grocery shopping online, and was checking prices on her phone during the interview.\\n\"Oh my, it really did get more expensive by a few dollars! Luckily, I can survive a few more weeks with two packs of gim, but if I see the same or higher price later, I probably won\\'t restock,\" she said.\\nThe worldwide appetite for gim reflects a growing global demand in Korean goods, driven by cultural influences like K-pop and K-dramas.\\nAs global audiences engage more deeply with such entertainment, they\\'re also increasing looking to Korean cuisine, something businesses worldwide have picked up on.\\nIn 2023, US supermarket chain Trader Joe\\'s Gimbap - a Korean rice roll wrapped in seaweed - went viral and was cleared off the shelves nationwide shortly after its launch.\\n\"I first learned about gim because it\\'s a typical Korean food often seen in K-dramas,\" Miki, a 22-year-old visitor from Japan told the BBC.\\n\"We do have similar thing called nori in Japan, but the taste is totally different. Gim is lighter and crispier, and is mostly grilled with sesame oil and salt, whereas nori is typically seasoned with soy sauce.\"\\nViola, a 60-year-old visitor from Brooklyn, New York, says she enjoys gim as a snack. \"I just pop it in my mouth like a potato chip,\" she said, adding that it feels like a \"healthier alternative\".\\n\"From Asian to Western countries, more people are becoming familiar with gim, increasing global demand,\" said Lee Eunhee, a professor of consumer studies at Inha University. \"To meet overseas demand, domestic prices are being pushed up.\"\\nKim Namin, 29, runs a seasoned gim processing factory with a 30-year family history in Wando, an island in South Korea\\'s southern waters known for abalone and seaweed production.\\nHis factory purchases raw seaweed, grills it with oil and salt, and cuts it into the familiar rectangular sheets sold in stores.\\nOver the past five years, most of their products have been exported globally.\\n\"There aren\\'t enough gim factories compared to the rising demand,\" he said, saying that his family is now considering expanding operations.\\nHe adds that gim is a highly price-sensitive staple in South Korea, long associated with affordability. Even marginal increases in its cost are keenly felt by consumers and tend to provoke strong public resistance - another reason why he\\'s focusing more on overseas markets.\\nGovernment officials and experts say the price increase is being driven by multiple factors, including overall inflation, rising labour costs, and a decline in overseas production.\\nHowever, many agree that increased growing global demand remains a major driver.\\nIn an effort to appease domestic consumers, companies - alongside the government - are taking steps to curb rising costs.\\nSouth Korea\\'s Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has pledged to closely monitor the situation to stabilise its price. and Korean food companies like Pulmone have plans to establish a land-based seaweed R&D centre, so they can be harvested throughout the year.\\nBack in Seoul, the market buzzes with tourists, and business is booming for Lee.\\n\"Gim has been selling like hot cakes... the ones for making gimbap are especially popular,\" she says.\\n\"I\\'m glad Korean gim is getting popular.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Tech titan Jeff Bezos\\'s $500m (£366m) superyacht, Koru, delivered in 2023, uses teak in its interior and for its decking.\\nThe dense and heavy tropical hardwood is prized for its remarkable properties such as rot and salt resistance, as well as its beauty and as a symbol of status and prestige.\\nThe highest quality teak comes from old-growth trees, which are harvested from natural forests almost exclusively in Myanmar.\\nBut sold by the country\\'s military-linked sector, with little regard for sustainability, the timber is illegal to import into the UK, EU and US.\\nTrade sanctions were imposed on the sector in 2021 following the coup there, though imports were already heavily restricted under longstanding laws.\\nNetherlands-based shipyard Oceanco, which built the Koru for Bezos, was fined in late 2024 by the authorities there for using Myanmar teak in the yacht\\'s interior.\\nWhether the Koru\\'s deck is also illegal Myanmar teak – or comes from legal plantations elsewhere – is under investigation in Germany, where the first importer of the deck\\'s wood appears to have been based.\\nAnother luxury yacht maker, UK-based Sunseeker, was also fined in late 2024 for the use of Myanmar teak. Both Sunseeker and Oceanco have described their breaches as unintentional, with Sunseeker citing a lapse in due diligence.\\nIt is a well-known problem that Myanmar teak continues to find its way into supply chains, passed off for example as plantation teak from other tropical countries.\\nAlternatives to the wood in the yacht industry are gaining traction.\\nThey range from thermally-modified woods, to fully synthetic materials, to engineered teak laminates – and while options have been around for years, recent innovations, say the companies and some users, are making them better.\\nWhile prosecutions doubtless have an impact, driving the trend to alternatives is the exhaustion of pre-sanctions stockpiles of old-growth timber.\\nMeanwhile, plantation teak from younger trees is widely seen by high-end shipyards as inferior, rarely coming in the long, wide, dark-brown boards associated with quality.\\nOther natural woods that could serve as teak substitutes often struggle to meet the industry\\'s exacting standards or are limited in supply.\\nCork is sometimes used. The fact that it is harvested from bark that can regrow rather than by felling trees makes it a sustainable, low-carbon choice proponents say, though its appearance doesn\\'t appeal to everyone.\\n\"Alternatives to natural teak are very welcome,\" says Walter Kollert, a Portugal-based forestry consultant and member of the steering committee of TEAKNET, a non-profit international teak information network.\\n\"We are in danger of losing old-growth teak forests which are part of a valuable ecosystem,\" he says.\\nWhile the furniture and housing industries also use old-growth teak, they have generally found it easier to substitute plantation teak than the yachting industry, he adds.\\nLast October major luxury yacht maker Sunreef Yachts, based in Poland and Dubai, announced it was transitioning away from teak decking altogether.\\n\"Teak is no longer an option anywhere in our range …[and] I believe we are the only ones to do this,\" says Nicolas Lapp, the company\\'s co-founder and chief technical officer.\\nThe decision, he says, was driven both by the difficulty of sourcing high quality plantation teak and the company\\'s push for greater sustainability.\\nWhen you buy plantation teaks, you have a lot of wood that\\'s just not usable, says Lapp.\\nAfter testing alternatives to teak, the company now offers two thermally-modified woods – in which a different natural wood is enhanced through heat to resemble teak – though it is not divulging publicly yet which those products are.\\nMeanwhile, some small boat models use a recyclable synthetic deck.\\nThe thermally modified woods not only match teak\\'s visual appeal but are easier to clean, and offer better thermal performance – staying cooler in the sun and insulating the cabins below, reducing the need for air conditioning, notes Lapp.\\nOne newer, thermally-modified wood product on the market is Tesumo, launched by a company of the same name in late 2021.\\nThe operation is small, but business is booming, says Arne Petersen, its managing director, adding it is working to increase output.\\nThere have been some examples in the past of thermally-modified wood which haven\\'t been successful which can cloud perceptions of newer materials, but Tesumo is a viable alternative, Petersen argues.\\nThe product, made in Germany, emerged from a research project involving the University of Göttingen and Lürssen shipyard – one of the world\\'s most prestigious yacht builders – after it struggled to find a good natural alternative to old-growth teak.\\nIt starts with a fast-growing undisclosed African hardwood which is heat-treated and then further processed, including with resin impregnation.\\nHigh-profile installations so far include one of the helipads on the Lürssen-built superyacht Dragonfly, reportedly owned by Google co-founder Sergey Bryn, and the complete deck of Boardwalk, another Lürssen-built superyacht linked to US businessman Tilman Fertitta, owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team.\\nSynthetic alternatives, including plastics, are also evolving. Among the earliest was Flexiteek, a UK-made PVC teak substitute introduced in 2000 and which is widely regarded as the market leader in its category.\\nIn late 2024, the company launched its third-generation product.\\nIt is easier to clean than real teak, retains its colour as teak greys over time, and has improved thermal performance compared to earlier versions says Steve Moore, the company\\'s marketing manager.\\nRichard Strauss the CEO of Teakdecking Systems has experience of the challenges of sourcing teak.\\nTeakdecking Systems manufactured the decks for the Koru at its factory in Spain. Strauss says the teak used on the deck was purchased through a wood trader within the EU.\\nAll the company\\'s teak is \"purchased with validation of the chain of custody paperwork by a third party firm,\" he says.\\nThe company fits decks using either plantation teak mostly sourced from India, or a small handful of alternatives it has had good success with. That includes a laminated wood product, Green Teak, which comes from Thailand.\\nLaminated teak is an engineered product in which plantation-grown teak, that would normally be rejected for high-end decking, is thinly sliced and glued together to form a strong, stable material.\\n\"You are kind of tricking the eye…[and in the process] using far more of the log,\" says Strauss.\\nMeanwhile old habits die hard. Strauss notes that plantation teak is still the most popular among his customers.\\nLapp of Sunreef says what\\'s really needed is a wider culture shift away from teak altogether.\\nCustomers typically start with wanting teak until they learn the problem and that alternatives can offer benefits.\\n\"Then we show them… and they realise they can\\'t tell the difference,\" says Lapp.\\nHowever, small UK family yacht building business Jeremy Rogers is sticking with teak for now – sourced from older government-managed plantations in Java that it is confident are authentic and harvested sustainably.\\nThe firm is keen to adopt a genuinely sustainable substitute that performs well, but its past experiments with alternatives have mostly fallen short, says Jessie Rogers.\\n\"The problem for the alternatives is there is nothing quite like real teak,\" she says.\\nCorrection 4 February: This article was amended to provide further details about Teakdecking Systems\\' role in making the teak deck for the Koru which were not included in an earlier version.\\n'},\n",

They are in custody and have not commented on the killings.\\nThe murders have left an uneasy quiet hanging over Umri, 182km (113 miles) from India\\'s capital Delhi. The village is home to about 400 families - from both Hindu and Muslim communities - and several resident told the BBC that they have shared a warm relationship without any history of religious disputes.\\nDeputy inspector general of state police Muniraj G told the BBC that police believe it to be a case of \"honour killing\" - murder by relatives or community members to punish women for falling in love or marrying outside of their caste or religion.\\nIndia\\'s National Crime Records Bureau began recording honour killings in 2014, when it listed 18 cases nationwide. Its latest annual report recorded 38 such cases in 2023.\\nActivists, however, say the numbers are significantly higher - in hundreds every year - as many cases are recorded simply as homicide.\\nUmri is in Uttar Pradesh\\'s Moradabad district, which is known for its metal craft industries. The region is largely rural, where strong social hierarchies continue to influence everyday life. Kajal\\'s brothers worked as masons in Moradabad town.\\nKajal and Arman\\'s relationship \"was the first case [of an interfaith relationship]\" in their village, says resident Mahipal Saini.\\nResidents of Umri who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said Kajal and Arman were neighbours who lived hardly 200m from each other. They described them as introverts who did not have many friends.\\nKajal taught at a private school in Umri, while Arman had returned to the village about five months ago after spending four years in Saudi Arabia where he worked at a food outlet. His relatives said he came back as he didn\\'t earn much there and had been working with a local stone-crushing contractor since his return.\\nIt\\'s not clear how they met and how long they had been a couple, but police say that \"the two were close\".\\nThey say the murders allegedly took place in Kajal\\'s house on the intervening night of 18 and 19 January, when her brothers caught Arman visiting her. The brothers - Rajaram, Satish and Rinku Saini - are in jail and have not said anything in their defence so far.\\nTheir father, Ganpat Saini, told the BBC that he and his wife were not at home at the time of the murders. He said they were sleeping in a shed on the outskirts of the village where they usually spend nights to guard their livestock. He added that he was grieving his daughter.\\nArman\\'s elder brother Farman Ali said that his brother left home after dinner on 18 January, saying he would be back with some medicines for their parents. When he hadn\\'t returned by the next morning and his phone was switched off, his family started panicking and went to the police. This led to a search operation in the village.\\nPolice allege that Kajal\\'s brothers attempted to mislead them by lodging a missing complaint about her on 20 January, accusing Arman of abducting her.\\nThey say they questioned both the families and found discrepancies in the statements of Kajal\\'s brothers.\\nFurther investigation led them to the spot where the bodies were buried, police said.\\nGanpat Saini says that when he and his wife returned home on the morning of 19 January, they could not find Kajal at home. He says he learnt about the murder only after the bodies were found.\\nHe, however, did not answer when asked whether he or anyone in his family knew that Kajal and Arman were in a relationship.\\nArman\\'s family say they were unaware of his relationship with Kajal.\\n\"He never told us anything,\" brother Farman Ali says. \"After we couldn\\'t find him for a whole day, some of his friends told us that he had been seeing Kajal for about two months.\"\\nVillagers say they usually resolve disputes with help from elected village council leaders. \"If the family [of Kajal] had acted more reasonably, the elders in the village could have helped resolve it,\" says villager Mahipal Saini.\\nPolice say they have deployed personnel to ensure there is no religious violence.

In 2018, the country\\'s top court mandated state governments to set up safe houses in every district to protect inter-faith and inter-caste couples from harassment.\\nYet cases of violence continue to be reported from across states.\\nResearch shows most Indians oppose inter-faith marriages, and controversial laws against religious conversion implemented in several states often keep such couples on edge.\\nFilmmaker Nakul Singh Sawhney, who made a documentary on the subject in 2012, says the official data on honour killing is far from adequate.\\n\"Most cases don\\'t make it to the official data unless the motive is clearly mentioned at the first stage of the police reports. And in many cases the honour killing angle emerges much later during investigation,\" says Sawhney.\\nHuman rights activist Kavita Srivastava says the failure to recognise the scale of the so-called honour crimes contributes to official indifference. \"When the problem is not seen, it is not acted upon,\" she says.\\nAs women increasingly assert their right to choose their partners, Srivastava adds, they often encounter resistance from what she describes as \"a deeply regressive social system\".\\nCourt orders, she says, alone cannot prevent \"honour crimes\" unless broader social attitudes are confronted.\\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.\\n'},\n",

But without question, they will be a considerable player in the future.\"\\nThere is certainly a need for another planemaker in Asia Pacific, analysts say.\\nAirlines in the region are feeling the strain from delivery delays at Boeing and Airbus, compounded by a shortage of engines and broader supply chain bottlenecks.\\nUncertainty over tariffs and trade tensions has further complicated challenges for the manufacturing sector, affecting procurement and growth strategy in the region.\\nIATA data shows that global carriers are waiting longer than ever for new aircraft, pushing the average fleet age up and increasing operating costs because older planes are less fuel efficient.\\nWalsh said that Asia Pacific airlines could see double digit growth in 2026 if planes were available. \"It\\'s incredibly frustrating for airlines. The wait between making an order and taking delivery is about seven years,\" he said.\\nThis is why Comac is emerging as another option for many Asia Pacific airlines.\\nThe company says it has delivered more than 200 C909 and C919 jets, with around a quarter of those planes being operated by airlines in Laos, Indonesia and Vietnam. Brunei\\'s GallopAir has placed a large order for the firm\\'s aircraft, and Cambodia is also planning to buy around 20 planes.\\n\"We need more suppliers in the supply chain,\" said Subhas Menon, director general of the Association for Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA). \"The problem with this industry is that the supply chain is an oligopoly and sometimes even a duopoly.\"\\n\"We have been waiting for this for a long time. Comac is a welcome introduction. We need more suppliers in the Asia Pacific especially.\"\\nThe company is in a good position with strong government support, and lower prices can make its aircraft appealing to budget airlines in emerging markets.\\n\"In the future we welcome all newcomers. We are keen to see more competition. Comac has got its certification process to go through and at some point in the 2030s, we see that it will be an offering that would be attractive to ourselves and other carriers,\" Mike Szucs, chief executive of low-cost Philippines carrier Cebu Pacific told the BBC.\\nAs well as expanding in Asia Pacific, Comac is also pursuing European certification, with regulators conducting test flights on its C919. This would allow it to sell to European carriers.\\nHowever, the road ahead remains long.\\nEuropean certification could take until 2028 or even 2031, regulators say. Meanwhile, harmonising a mix of Chinese and Western parts, flight controls, and software also presents technical challenges for international orders.\\nMaintenance and repair infrastructure is another hurdle, as is pilot training - areas where manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus have had infrastructure and systems set up for decades.\\nAnd in Asia Pacific, Comac has some competition beyond Boeing and Airbus.\\nBrazil\\'s Embraer has carved out a foothold in the region with Singapore budget carrier Scoot, Virgin Australia and Japan\\'s All Nippon Airlines (ANA) placing orders for Embraer jets.\\nMeanwhile, Boeing and Airbus still have a strong presence at the Singapore Airshow and the region as a whole. Both manufacturers are signalling to local carriers that aircraft delivery delays, which have frustrated airlines for years, are beginning to improve.\\n\"We are pleased to say that we might be seeing light at the end of tunnel,\" Mike Szucs of Cebu Pacific said.\\nThere are questions about Comac\\'s order numbers, too. It has previously said it has more than 1,000 C919 passenger plane orders to Chinese airlines, but only a dozen have been delivered so far.\\nAnd verifying these order numbers is difficult as Comac is a state-owned Chinese company not a publicly listed one like Boeing or Airbus.\\nUnless Comac can address some or all of these issues, Boeing and Airbus are likely to continue controlling the skies above Asia Pacific.\\n'},\n",

A Boeing spokesperson had told the BBC in response to a question that the company was supporting Air India\\'s \"review of this matter\".\\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Tuesday that when the switches were operated according to Boeing\\'s recommended procedure, they were found to be \"satisfactory\", staying at run instead of moving to cut-off (which can stop fuel supply to the engines).\\nIt added, however, that incorrectly handling the switch caused it to \"move easily from run to cut-off\".\\nThese checks were performed in the presence of DGCA officials on the affected aircraft and another aircraft, the statement said. The DGCA has also asked Air India to circulate Boeing\\'s recommended procedure to operate the switch to its crew members.\\nThe grounding of the plane gained a lot of attention as it came amid an ongoing investigation into last June\\'s plane crash involving an Air India aircraft of the same model which killed 260 people.\\nThe crash of the London-bound Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner occurred less than a minute after the plane took off from Ahmedabad airport in western India.\\nIndia\\'s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is investigating the crash and a final report is expected to be released in a few months.\\nA preliminary report last July said that the plane\\'s engines shut down after its fuel switches moved from the \\'run\\' to the \\'cut-off\\' position shortly after take-off, but did not establish how this had happened.\\nAir India crash plane had record of safety defects, campaigners claim\\nWhy cockpit audio deepens the mystery of Air India crash\\nAfter the report was released, the US aviation regulator said that fuel control switches in Boeing airplanes were safe.\\nIndia\\'s aviation regulator had also ordered an investigation of cockpit fuel switches in Boeing 787 and Boeing 737 aircraft operating in the country after the crash. Air India had said then that its inspections did not find any issue with the locking mechanism of the switch, which it reiterated on Monday.\\n\"Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA [Directorate General of Civil Aviation], and had found no issues,\" the airline said in the statement.\\nOn Tuesday, Reuters news agency reported that Air India had begun re-checking the fuel switches on its Boeing Dreamliner aircraft following the incident flagged by the pilot.\\nAviation consultant and former air accident investigator Tim Atkinson told the BBC that he trusted Boeing\\'s design of the fuel control switches.\\n\"These switches are designed with one purpose in mind, and that is that they cannot be moved unintentionally. There is no doubt in my mind that the design is good.

       "  'Article': 'Devendra, who was a farmer in India, still remembers the moment a snake sank its fangs into his leg while he was picking mulberry leaves.\\n\"I went to the hospital four days after I was bitten, when the pain became unbearable. But the delay cost me my leg,\" he says in a short film released by Global Snakebite Taskforce (GST), an initiative working to reduce deaths and injuries by snakebites.\\nBut Devendra is still among the lucky few to have survived. According to the federal government, around 50,000 Indians are killed by snakebites each year - roughly half of all deaths worldwide. Some estimates suggest the toll could be even higher: between 2000 and 2019, India may have seen as many as 1.2 million deaths, an average of 58,000 per year, a 2020 study said.\\nNow, a new report by GST has found that 99% of healthcare workers in India face challenges administering antivenom - the life-saving antibodies that neutralise toxins in venom. Researchers surveyed 904 medical professionals across India, Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria, the countries most affected by snakebites, and found similar barriers: poor infrastructure, limited access to antivenom and insufficient training.\\nNearly half of the professionals reported that delays in treatment had led to serious complications in their patients, including amputations, surgeries or lifelong mobility problems.\\nIn 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally listed snakebite envenoming or poisoning as a \"highest priority neglected tropical disease\" because of the high number of deaths caused by it. An estimated 5.4 million people worldwide are bitten by snakes each year and more than 100,000 die from annually, according to the WHO.\\nIt also states that snakebites disproportionately affect poor rural communities in low and middle-income countries.\\nIn India, a high concentration of snakebite deaths and injuries are reported in the central and eastern regions, says Dr Yogesh Jain, a GST member and practitioner in the central Chhattisgarh state. He adds that people working in farms, including those from poor tribal communities, remain most vulnerable.\\nIn 2024, India launched the National Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Snakebite Envenoming (NAPSE) with the aim to halve snakebite deaths by 2030. The plan focuses on better surveillance, improved antivenom availability and research, enhanced medical capacity and public awareness campaigns.\\nExperts agree it is a step in the right direction, but implementation has been inconsistent.\\n\"In India, snakebites are seen as a poor person\\'s problem,\" Jain says. \"That\\'s why there isn\\'t enough outrage or action over these completely avoidable deaths. When it comes to treating snakebites, every second counts.\"\\nHe explains that snake venom enters the bloodstream within minutes, attacking nerves, cells or the circulatory system, depending on the species. Delays in antivenom administration can result in respiratory failure, paralysis, irreversible tissue damage or organ failure.\\nYet, delays to hospital care are common in rural India, where bad roads, far-flung hospitals and a dearth of ambulance services prevent timely treatment.\\nLast September, a pregnant woman in Gujarat state reportedly died on the way to a hospital after her family had to carry her in a cloth sling for 5km (3 miles) because no vehicle could reach their hamlet.\\nJain says that some states are trying to improve access by stocking antivenom in primary and community health centres. But administering it correctly remains a major challenge.\\nMany health workers are not trained professionals and fear giving antivenom because patients can sometimes develop adverse reactions.\\n\"The antivenom is mixed with saline and injected intravenously over an hour, but many centres aren\\'t equipped to manage the side-effects,\" Jain says.\\nAnother problem, he adds, is that many people in rural India still rely on faith healers or local medicinal practices and go to hospitals only when their symptoms worsen, which can be lethal.\\nGerry Martin, co-founder of The Liana Trust, which works to reduce human-snake conflict in Karnataka state, says another major hurdle is the availability of high-quality antivenom.\\nCurrently, India has antivenom that only protects against the \"big four\" snakes - the spectacled cobra, common krait, Russell\\'s viper and the saw-scaled viper - which are believed to be responsible for a majority of the bites. The antivenom is produced by injecting venom from these snakes into horses, whose antibodies are then used as treatment for humans, Martin explains.\\nBut there are dozens of other poisonous snake species for which India does not have targeted antivenom. These include the green pit viper commonly found in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, the Malabar pit viper and hump-nosed pit viper found in southern states and many other species in the north-eastern states.\\nA study by Aiims (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, last year highlighted the problem. It found that when antivenom used to treat bites by saw-scaled vipers was administered to 105 snake bite patients (where the species remained unknown), two-thirds did not respond well to treatment.\\nThe study concluded that there was an urgent need for \"region-specific antivenom in western India\".\\nFor the past five years, The Liana Trust has been studying venoms from species beyond the big four to develop antidotes to them. But progress has been slow, Martin says, because the process is labour-intensive and time-consuming.\\nHe called on states to emulate the 2024 order from the government of the southern state of Karnataka which made snakebites \"a notifiable disease\" - making it compulsory for health professionals to report it to the authorities - to combat under-reporting.\\nJain agrees. \"Snakebite deaths start where political will ends,\" he says.\\n\"Governments should ensure that poor people don\\'t get poor health systems.

The fiscal deficit is the gap between the government\\'s total expenditure and its total revenue.\\nHere are five key takeaways from the budget announcements:\\nInfrastructure such as road, port and railway projects has been a mainstay focus of the Narendra Modi government for the past decade, and this budget continues to expand allocations to these sectors.\\nThe capital spending target for the upcoming financial year beginning 1 April has gone up some 9% to 12.2tn rupees ($133.1bn; £105bn) from 11.1tn rupees.\\nOutlays for defence have also jumped by over 20% in the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions globally.\\nThe government has proposed to scale up manufacturing in seven strategic sectors including semiconductors, data centres, textiles and rare earths, amid slowing private investments and a flight of foreign capital from India.\\nSitharaman announced that dedicated corridors will be set up for rare earth minerals in four states, including Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh in the south and Odisha in the east. The announcement follows India\\'s approval of a 73bn-rupee rare earths scheme unveiled in November.\\nThe budget also launched a second semiconductor mission with an outlay of $436m to produce equipment and materials and design full-stack intellectual property.\\nIndia is also proposing a tax holiday up to 2047 for foreign cloud companies making data-centre investments in the country and providing cloud services to customers globally. India has been attracting billions of dollars of data centre investments with the likes of Google last year announcing a $15bn investment in a facility in southern India.\\nThis provides \"long-term fiscal certainty for a highly capital-intensive sector, significantly improving investment viability and accelerating capacity creation\", said Ritika Loganey Gupta of Ernst & Young India.\\nThe budget has also announced new mega-textiles parks to enhance India\\'s exports competitiveness in the labour-intensive garments industry - expected to benefit from greater global market access following last week\\'s India-EU free trade agreement.\\nAmid slowing exports because of US tariffs, India has proposed raising limits on duty-free inputs for industries such as seafood, which are major export sectors. Customs duty exemptions have also been allowed for inputs used to manufacture lithium-ion batteries.\\nBut no direct tax cuts have been announced on personal incomes. This was expected as Modi\\'s government had raised income tax exemption limits last year, making earnings of up to 1.2m rupees - excluding special rate income like capital gains - entirely tax-free. There was also a rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST), leaving little fiscal room for fresh cuts.\\nStarting April 2026, the government has shifted from targeting a rigid yearly fiscal deficit - the gap between revenue and expenditure - to focusing on the overall debt-to-GDP ratio, which is a country\\'s total government debt to the size of the economy.\\nThe government now aims to bring down this ratio from 56% to 50% (+/-1%) by 2030-31 - this will give Delhi more flexibility to spend on higher capital expenditure and adapt its spending needs more effectively, according to economists.\\nThe debt-to-GDP ratio for the upcoming financial year is estimated to ease to 55.6%, and the fiscal deficit estimated to come down from 4.4% to 4.3% of GDP.\\nDespite strong signalling on fiscal discipline, the financial markets, which were open in special trading on Sunday because of the budget, fell sharply as the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options trading was raised.\\n\"Coming on top of last year\\'s hike, this is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers and arbitrageurs.

And because customers never walk into these spaces, everything inside is arranged for fast picking rather than browsing.\\nTo see how this works, the BBC visited one such dark store in north-west Delhi.\\nInside, goods are stacked neatly on racks - with vegetables in one section, freezer units in another corner, and shelves stuffed with crisps, fizzy drinks and even pet food.\\nThe aisles are so narrow only the workers can weave through them, moving fast and rarely bumping into each other.\\nThe moment an order pops up on the screen, workers jump into action - picking, scanning, and packing items into the trademark brown paper bags with such speed it almost feels robotic.\\n\"Done in under a minute,\" store manager Sagar says proudly.\\nDelivery riders walk up to the counter, almost in tune with the packers.

On a good day, he takes home between 900 and 1,000 rupees, after deducting money spent on fuel and food. But his earnings fluctuate constantly, depending on order volume, distance, and the incentives offered by the app.\\nHe is one of millions working in India\\'s rapidly expanding gig economy, which is expected to employ 23.5 million people by 2030.\\nLow-paid convenience work is nothing new in India, but what has changed in recent years is the scale. Digital platforms have turned informal deliveries into a vast, app-driven workforce governed by algorithms.\\nLike most gig workers, Alam is classified as a \"partner\", not an employee.\\nHe gets no fixed salary, no paid leave, and no social security. Although the government has promised labour reforms that could offer basic protections to gig workers, they are yet to be implemented.\\nEach day, Alam, like many other riders, logs in to the app and books his work slots, also called \"gig slots\".\\nThe idea is simple - the more deliveries riders complete during those windows, the more \"streak\" incentives they unlock, boosting their pay and rewarding longer hours.\\nIn December, Alam says he earned an additional 16,000 rupees through incentives alone. He completed more than 1,000 orders and worked 406 hours that month.\\nBut this setup can unravel quickly for drivers.\\nEarlier this month, Alam\\'s phone was stolen mid-shift. He had already worked five consecutive days for more than 12 hours and was just two days away from earning another 5,000-rupee incentive. Without his phone, he could not log in and his streak reset instantly.\\n\"I was sad for a few days,\" Alam says. \"But what can I do? At least I got the standard pay.\"\\nThis incentive structure is not unique to India, but it is intensified by labour availability and weak worker protections, says Vandana Vasudevan, a researcher and author of OTP Please! Online Buyers, Sellers and Gig Workers.\\n\"These workers are classified as independent contractors, not salaried employees,\" she says. \"They have no social security or benefits, yet algorithms still control their work through ratings, penalties and pay.\"\\nThis pressure shows on the roads.\\nAlam admits he often speeds, squeezes through traffic and sometimes jumps signals to stay on target. Late deliveries can trigger customer complaints or warnings from managers.\\nLast month, delivery workers in several Indian cities went on strike over falling incomes, unpredictable incentives and unsafe conditions.\\nIt sparked a massive social media debate and the labour ministry ordered platforms to drop aggressive marketing language promising \"10-minute deliveries\".\\nExperts say the move may not dramatically alter daily conditions for riders, but it does remove the expectation that every order should arrive within a fixed time.\\nTo understand why that pressure exists at all, it helps to look at how quick commerce has grown in Indian cities.\\nThe sector exploded after the pandemic, when lockdowns kept people indoors and crowded markets felt unsafe.\\nIn many Western countries, grocery delivery services such as Getir surged during that period - but once the restrictions eased and people returned to supermarkets - many scaled back or were forced to shut down.\\nIndia, however, followed a different trajectory.\\n\"In other countries platforms avoid committing to a fixed 10-minute promise and instead use terms like \\'very fast\\' - thus lowering customer expectations. They also charge a premium for faster delivery, but in India there are no such constraints,\" Vasudevan adds.\\nHere, you can even order a single avocado - and while it may cost a bit more than buying it from the neighbourhood shop, many urban consumers are willing to pay that premium simply to save time.\\nThat willingness has driven its growth in metropolitan cities, says Ankur Bisen, a partner at retail advisory firm Technopak.\\n\"Quick commerce has tapped into a huge pool of time-poor urban residents who spend long hours commuting and would rather order in essentials than step out again,\" he says.\\nDespite the buzz, quick commerce remains a small fraction of India\\'s total retail economy and profitability remains elusive.\\n\"They\\'re still losing money,\" Bisen says, adding that these players are yet to come up with a sustainable business model.\\nIntense competition between Blinkit, Swiggy, Instamart, Zepto and now even Amazon keeps pushing companies to chase customers with ever-shorter delivery promises and heavy discounts in a price-sensitive market.\\nFor users like Singh, quick commerce has shifted from an occasional convenience to a daily habit.\\n\"It\\'s not that I can\\'t live without quick delivery,\" she says. \"But I\\'ve grown so used to it that we forget it is a rare privilege and that there is human labour behind it.\"\\nThere are signs that awareness is beginning to shift.\\nA recent survey by community platform LocalCircles found that 74% of respondents supported the government\\'s decision to drop the \"10-minute delivery\" tagline. Nearly 40% said they were willing to wait longer for their groceries, rather than receive them at ultra-fast speed.\\nWhether that willingness translates into meaningful change on the ground remains uncertain. For now, the speed of India\\'s cities is still being measured in minutes - and carried on the backs of workers who have little choice but to keep moving.\\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.\\n'},\n",

The media tycoon, a British citizen, was found guilty of colluding with foreign forces under a controversial national security law.\\nSpeaking to the BBC\\'s World Tonight programme, Baroness Kennedy said she was pleased the Labour government had secured concessions where Conservative leaders, including David Cameron and Boris Johnson, had not but said she had hoped for more.\\n\"At least they\\'ve gone in there and got something out of this,\" she said, adding: \"I\\'m not going to have balloons on my door and throw confetti around to celebrate this -- I think it\\'s a meagre return, and I\\'d like to see Jimmy Lai being released.\"\\nThe peer said she had not yet been briefed on what discussions had taken place about the case of Lai but she told the BBC she \"was hoping that we might hear some good news on that front\".\\nThe prime minister has confirmed to the BBC that he did raise the Lai case and the treatment of Uyghurs \"as you would expect\" with President Xi.\\nThe original group of seven to be sanctioned were all vocal critics of China as members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, although former Conservative MP Tim Loughton stood down at the last election.\\nBaroness Kennedy, a former colleague of Sir Keir Starmer when he was a lawyer, and crossbencher Lord Alton were sanctioned alongside four sitting Conservative MPs - Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Nusrat Ghani, Tom Tugendhat and Neil O\\'Brien.\\nThey have criticised the \"selective lifting of sanctions\", saying they would \"take no comfort\" in China\\'s decision while Lai remains imprisoned and Uyghurs continue to suffer.\\nSir Keir\\'s three-day trip to China - the first by a British prime minister since 2018 - is an attempt to thaw relations and he has argued that the lifting of some sanctions \"vindicated\" his diplomatic approach.\\nSir Keir also told the BBC an agreement to halve import taxes on British whisky would come into force on Monday next week, but added that the start date for a deal on visa-free travel for British citizens to China had not yet been agreed.\\nThe UK has confirmed it has not lifted sanctions on any Chinese individuals, but it is not known if restrictions have been lifted on other people sanctioned by China, including Loughton who stood down at the general election in 2024.\\nSir Geoffrey Nice KC, chair of the Uyghur Tribunal, which is investigating atrocities against the minority group, was also sanctioned, as was Newcastle University academic Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on the Uyghurs.\\nFormer security minister Tugendhat accused the prime minister of securing too little, despite sanctions on him lifted.\\nHe told BBC Radio 4\\'s World at One programme that the China deal was \"frankly extraordinary and unbelievably bad, not just for this particular round of diplomatic activity but for Britain\\'s standing in the world\".\\nHe also criticised the \"abasement before going, so allowing the mega embassy and not demanding the release of Jimmy Lai, who as we know is a British citizen in prison in Hong Kong for now more than 1,000 days for the crime of journalism\".\\nThe deal was also criticised by Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse, who says she was \"arbitrarily denied entry\" to Hong Kong to visit her newborn grandson last year. She said a diplomatic reset that ignores \"the existence of secret bans\" is \"not a reset at all\".\\nHobhouse, a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, has not officially been sanctioned. She was held at the airport, questioned and sent back to Britain - a decision she believes was taken to silence her.\\n\"We need assurance from the prime minister that all parliamentarians can criticise the actions of the Chinese Communist Party without fear of retribution,\" she said.\\n\\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

They blame the country\\'s military chief, Field Marshall Asim Munir, a charge the government rejects. It says the meetings stopped because Khan broke jail rules prohibiting discussion of politics.\\nWhile Khan may be silenced, he\\'s far from the only one under pressure.\\nJournalists, analysts and human rights advocates say the space to disagree with the state is increasingly limited – and the risks greater.\\nLast weekend, human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband were convicted of sharing anti-state social media posts.\\nThe couple will spend 10 years in jail.\\nAhead of sentencing, Amnesty International had called on Pakistan to end \"coercive tactics used to silence dissent and intimidate those who defend human rights\".\\nKhan\\'s family are very clear about the effort to wipe him from the public\\'s mind.\\n\"There are two names you can\\'t have on television. You can\\'t say anything nice about Imran Khan, and you can\\'t say anything bad about Asim Munir,\" his sister Aleema Khanum told the BBC. She was speaking at a recent protest by supporters a few kilometres from his cell in Rawalpindi\\'s Adiala jail.\\nIt\\'s been more than eight weeks since Khan saw a family member, more than five since he met a lawyer and then it was only for eight minutes, his party says.\\n\"This is the only way we have right now to create enough pressure that we are allowed to meet him,\" Khanum said at the protest. \"It\\'s his right to meet his lawyers, it\\'s his right to meet his family, it\\'s his communication with the outside world.\"\\nThat communication from Khan has often been highly critical of Pakistan\\'s government and military chief. After meetings inside the jail, Khan\\'s words have often been posted on his X account, attributed to him and giving directions to his party and supporters.\\n\"They are unable to block his voice because people want to hear him, they read his messages, they are not giving up on him,\" Khanum says.\\nBut for now, with meetings stopped, so have those messages.\\nKhan, imprisoned since August 2023, is convicted in several corruption cases which he says are politically motivated.\\nThe government and military reject claims he is being held in isolation. Talal Chaudhry, an interior minister, has called him \"the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan\", with gym equipment and a cook.\\nAfter a post appeared quoting Khan on his X account, calling Munir a \"mentally unstable person\", the military spokesperson held a two-hour news conference broadcast across Pakistan\\'s media, saying Khan had gone beyond politics and labelled him a national security threat.\\n\"One could argue that the military is really leading the country on so many levels now that Pakistan\\'s coming quite close to authoritarian rule,\" says Michael Kugelman, senior fellow on South Asia at the Atlantic Council.\\n\"This is the worst the repression has been during any period of civilian rule.\"\\nPakistan\\'s military, often referred to as \"the establishment\", have been an ever-present factor in the country politics, including periods of military dictatorship.\\nInitially, Khan and the military appeared close; many believe their backing helped bring Khan to power and the opposition at the time initially accused him of being in thrall to the military while he governed. Khan\\'s party denied this.\\nBy the time he was ousted in a vote of no confidence in 2022, Khan had not only fallen out with the military leadership, but blamed them for his removal from power.\\nIn November 2025, a constitutional amendment granted Munir lifetime immunity from prosecution and oversight of all Pakistan\\'s defence forces.\\nMany saw it as a further sign that the military\\'s influence over Pakistan was at a high-water mark under a civilian government.\\nThe current government deny the military are calling the shots.\\n\"The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,\" Chaudhry says, adding the chief of defence forces \"is doing a marvellous job\".\\nSecurity sources said: \"The military has always maintained it operates within legal bounds.\"\\nBut Michael Kugelman and others see a connection between the military\\'s involvement in politics and the amount of space to speak out.\\n\"It\\'s intrinsically linked to how strong or weak a democratic government is and what their relationship is with the military,\" says Munizae Jahangir, a journalist and co-chair for the Human Rights Council of Pakistan (HRCP).\\n\"If the military is more dominant, there will be less space for protest, there will be less space for dissent, there will be less space for free expression.\"\\nOf those already jailed, Mazari is among the most prominent. A lawyer who has worked on some of the most sensitive cases in Pakistan, she and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha were convicted of \"disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups\".\\nThe government have defended their sentencing; in response Pakistan\\'s information minister posted on X: \"As you sow, so you shall reap!\"\\n\"Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,\" Chaudhry said.\\nOther human rights advocates told the BBC they have faced limits on how they can operate.\\nHRCP say that their staff have been harassed on phone calls and stopped from holding round-table discussions at hotels unless they obtain permission in advance. The government says this is \"to ensure security\".\\nJournalists, too, say they have felt pressure. In 2023, the BBC reported that TV channels had been told that they must not show Khan\\'s face, his voice or say his name. The topics that should not be covered, according to journalists the BBC spoke to, have expanded.\\n\"They [Pakistan\\'s authorities] have controlled the mainstream media to a large extent,\" said Azaz Syed, a reporter for Geo TV. He says that even stories tangentially linked to the military – including one he recently did on a defence housing authority – have led to phone calls from unknown numbers with warnings to go no further.\\nJahangir says she has even been told by editors not to cover certain stories.\\n\"The editors are not doing this for fun. They do fundamentally believe in freedom of expression. They are doing this in order to survive,\" she says.\\nJournalists from other outlets who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said that a culture of self-censorship was now common in newsrooms.\\n\"There were times in the past when there was complete censorship,\" one said. \"Now there is self-censorship, which in many ways is worse because we are deceiving the audience.\"\\nThe BBC approached the military for comment.\\nSecurity sources told us that ISPR, the military\\'s communications arm, \"does not regulate media content, freedom of speech, or interfere in civilian journalism, nor does it exercise any authority over public discourse beyond its lawful communication role\".\\nDawn newspaper - the oldest in Pakistan, founded in 1941 by the country\\'s founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah - has taken a financial hit for its reporting. In December, Dawn Media Group said it had been subject to an unannounced ban on government adverts, firstly on its newspaper, then on its TV and radio outlets, a move the Council of Newspaper Editors said was \"financially crippling the organisation\".\\n\"While some within the state may think that punishing outlets that refuse to toe the line may snuff out critical voices, in the modern age this is next to impossible,\" the editorial board said.\\nInformation minister Atta Tarar denied that Dawn was denied government advertisement.\\nSeveral journalists said that the changes to Pakistan\\'s Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act in early 2025 have made the environment more difficult.\\nPakistan\\'s authorities introduced the changes, saying they were needed to fight what the military has often termed \"digital terrorism\"; spreading what they see to be \"anarchy and false information\" to undermine the state. The country\\'s constitution protects the right to freedom of speech and expression subject to reasonable restrictions, security sources told the BBC.\\n\"It\\'s false to claim Pakistan suppresses free speech,\" says Chaudhry. He cites the dangers of social media being used for financial fraud and recruiting terrorists. \"We want to regulate social media, the whole world is regulating [it].\"\\nBut others say they can be used to limit journalists\\' ability to report.\\n\"Changes made to the law have now made it an explicit crime to criticise the security establishment, the judiciary and definitions around national interest have been made even more vague. There are astonishingly steep fines and the penalties have been enhanced disproportionately,\" says Adnan Rehmat, a media analyst based in Islamabad.\\nHe says there are the official rules, then there are further unspoken rules: \"It\\'s really difficult to know what the boundaries are, they are forever shifting.\"\\nLimitations on journalists are not new in Pakistan. Under Khan\\'s government, journalists protested about restrictions placed on what they could publish and broadcast.\\nSyed sees the current situation as a continuation of the operation against the media. Jahangir also sees some level of historical continuity. \"I can\\'t say this has been the worst time, but let\\'s say that times haven\\'t improved for us.\"\\nWhile attempts to limit and intimidate critics have happened before, some think there is a new approach this time.\\n\"It feels like something has shifted,\" says Azeema Cheema, an Islamabad-based research director specialising in conflict, fragility and violence. \"Because now you are using the courts. You are using institutions, not extra institutional measures.\"\\nThose operating online outside Pakistan are in the authorities\\' sights too. In early January, seven Pakistani journalists and Youtubers, including two former army officers, were tried in absentia and given life sentences for digital terrorism. The prosecution accused them of \"waging war against state\" and \"incitement\" in relation to protests that took place on 9 May 2023 after Khan\\'s first arrest.\\nIn a post on X, one of the sentenced, Adil Raja, said \"speaking truth to power is now called Digital Terrorism in Pakistan\".\\nSyed and Cheema cite this case as a particularly stark example of harsh sentencing.\\n\"There\\'s been a growing realisation that the state is excessively willing and unapologetically willing to wield a blunt hammer,\" says Cheema.\\nWhere that hammer may fall next is what many we spoke to are trying to calculate.\\nAdditional reporting by Usman Zahid\\n'},\n",

Officials are often executed for corruption. The accusations made against the Ming family were far more serious.\\nThe Ming, Bau, Wei and Liu clans have dominated the remote border town of Laukkaing in Myanmar\\'s impoverished Shan state, since 2009.\\nThey rose to power after General Min Aung Hlaing, the current coup leader in Myanmar, led a military operation to drive out the MNDAA, the ethnic insurgent army which had dominated Laukkaing and the area around it since the 1980s.\\nThe four families, as they became known, took over and began shifting from the old dependence on opium and methamphetamine production to a new economy based on casinos and, eventually, online fraud.\\nThey remained close to the Myanmar military; in December 2021, after seizing power in his coup, Min Aung Hlaing feted Liu Zhengxiang, patriarch of the Liu clan, in the capital Nay Pyi Taw and awarded him an honorary title for \"extraordinary contributions to state development\".\\nHis Fully Light conglomerate had lucrative businesses all over Myanmar. Other members of the four families were candidates for the military-backed party the USDP.\\nThe scam compounds they ran in Laukkaing, though, were brutal, much more so than scam complexes in other parts of Asia. Torture was routine.\\nTens of thousands of mainly Chinese workers were lured there with promises of well-paid jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned in the compounds. They were forced to run elaborate \"pig-butchering\" scams, where most of the victims were also Chinese. Complaints from the victims, and by the families of those trapped in the compounds multiplied on social media.\\nThe most notorious compound in Laukkaing was called Crouching Tiger Villa, run by the Ming family. In October 2023, during what is believed to have been an escape attempt, the guards killed several Chinese nationals. The Chinese authorities felt compelled to take action.\\nWith China\\'s apparent blessing the MNDAA and its allies attacked and recaptured Laukkaing, as part of their offensive against the Myanmar army in the ongoing civil war. The MNDAA vowed to stamp out the scam business completely.\\nThey detained the heads of the four families and handed more than 60 of their relatives and associates to the Chinese police. Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, or warlord, killed himself after being captured, authorities said.\\nDuring interrogations by the Chinese police one of the family members is reported to have admitted killing someone chosen at random just to demonstrate his strength.\\nThese details have been publicised by China to justify its tough treatment of the families. Five of the Bau family are also awaiting execution, while the trials of the Wei and Liu families have not yet concluded.\\nThe four families are ethnic Chinese, and had close ties to the authorities on the Chinese side of the border in Yunnan. Their abuses were too close to home for China, and the action against the scam business in Laukkaing has been the most decisive yet.\\nChina has also prevailed on Thailand and Cambodia to extradite two Chinese business figures accused of running scam empires, She Zhijiang, who built an entire city in Myanmar\\'s war-torn Karen State, and Chen Zhi, who amassed wealth and power with his Prince Group conglomerate in Cambodia. The Chinese government has also brought tens of thousands of its citizens who were working in scam compounds back to China to face trial.\\nThe scam business, though, has simply adapted and evolved. It is still thought to be by far the biggest business in Cambodia, despite pressure from China and the US on the government there to shut it down.\\nAnd it has kept moving to new areas in Myanmar, even as the more prominent scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the Thai-Myanmar border, have been forced to close down.\\n'},\n",

These are tell-tale signs of labour market weakness.\\nThe hiring freeze in the software sector, which birthed India\\'s middle class from the 1990s, highlights the growing disruption caused by AI in the country\\'s vast back-office economy.\\nThe slowdown in white-collar hiring accompanies the continuing crisis at India\\'s labour-intensive exports units.\\nIndia has entered 2026 with the looming shadow of Trump\\'s 50% tariffs – a deadlock that\\'s lasted far longer than expected. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s government has displayed great expediency for trade diversification by inking a string of free trade deals or FTAs - most recently with the European Union this week – the drag on exports has begun to show.\\n\"Exports to the US weakened sequentially since the implementation of the 50% US tariff, while to the rest of the world it has picked up only marginally,\" according to HSBC Research.\\nFTAs will help in the longer run, but whether India can compete with countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh in selling to non-US geographies would depend on many other things like quality, price and scale, say analysts.\\nWhile tariffs have dominated trade debates, economists continue to worry about another long-term trend India has struggled to reverse despite rapid growth: weak private investment.\\nJP Morgan\\'s Jehangir Aziz recently told How India\\'s Economy Works podcast that corporate investment had \"flatlined since 2012\" and remained at around 12% of GDP. \"The question that the government isn\\'t asking is: how come for 13 straight years, corporate India has not invested?\" he said.\\nAccording to Aziz, fresh investments have stalled because factories continue to have excess capacity since demand isn\\'t strong enough, which is preventing new capacity from coming up.\\nThis, combined with other trends such as foreign investors pulling money out of India, is a sign that high reported GDP growth masks underlying weaknesses, says Ruchir Sharma, chair of Rockefeller International.\\n\"India has long attracted only modest capital from abroad, thanks in large measure to the lingering \\'Licence Raj\\', which can make it prohibitively expensive to acquire land or hire and fire workers,\" Sharma wrote in a recent piece for the Financial Times.\\n\"Asian economies that have sustained rapid growth - such as China and Vietnam more recently - saw net foreign direct investment surge above 4% of GDP during their boom phases. That figure never surpassed 1.5% in India, and it is now just 0.1%.\"\\nTo be fair, the government recently updated its labour codes which, it says, will ease up the climate of doing business. Whether that\\'s enough to draw foreign capital back, however, remains an open question.\\nAgainst this backdrop, the finance minister is likely to emphasise on two key pillars in the budget: more reforms and fiscal restraint, according to HSBC Research.\\n\"Potential focus areas could include expanding the production-linked incentive scheme [incentives designed to boost domestic manufacturing] and support for MSMEs [medium and small sized enterprises] and exporters,\" according to Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi, analysts at Japan\\'s Nomura.\\nThere could also be larger capital outlays for defence and a lowering of customs duty slabs as India tries to push exports.\\nThe Modi government has spent more than $100bn annually on building new infrastructure like roads, railways and telecom equipment in the last four years. That trend is likely to continue – with capital expenditure expected to remain stable at 3% of GDP, according to ICICI Bank Global Markets.\\nBut given last year\\'s budget focused on easing pressures on the middle class - with income tax and GST cuts amounting to about 0.9% of GDP - the government\\'s tax shortfalls are expected to widen.\\nAs a result the thrust will be on ensuring that the deficit is brought down, or at least maintained.\\n\"While fiscal expansion is unlikely, we forecast the finance minister would refrain from further consolidation,\" Nuvama Securities said in a note.\\n\"A big stimulus is unlikely as the exchequer remains committed to reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio by 1% annually until FY31 [financial year 2030-31], implying a continued focus on deleveraging.\"\\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': \"China has executed 11 members of a notorious mafia family that ran scam centres in Myanmar along its north-eastern border, state media report.\\nThe Ming family members were sentenced in September for various crimes including homicide, illegal detention, fraud and operating gambling dens by a court in China's Zhejiang province.\\nThe Mings were one of many clans that ran the town of Laukkaing, transforming an impoverished backwater town into a flashy hub of casinos and red-light districts.\\nTheir scam empire came crashing down in 2023, when they were detained and handed over to China by ethnic militias that had taken control of Laukkaing during an escalation in their conflict with Myanmar's army.\\nWith these executions Beijing is sending a message of deterrence to would-be scammers. But the business has now moved to Myanmar's border with Thailand, and to Cambodia and Laos, where China has much less influence.\\nHundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia, according to estimates by the UN. Among them are thousands of Chinese people, and their victims who they swindle billions of dollars from are mainly Chinese too.\\nFrustrated by the Myanmar military's refusal to stop the scam business, from which it was almost certainly profiting, Beijing tacitly backed an offensive by an ethnic insurgent alliance in Shan State in late 2023. The alliance captured significant territory from the military and overran Laukkaing, a key border town.\\n\\nThe eleven members of the Ming family are the first of the Myanmar scam bosses to be executed by China.\\nBut they will not be the last. Five members of the Bai family were also sentenced to death in November, and the trials of two other groups of defendants from the Wei and the Liu families have not yet concluded.\\nThe Ming family's trial was held behind closed doors, although more than 160 people were allowed to attend their sentencing hearing last year, including families of victims.\\nThe Ming mafia's scam operations and gambling dens brought in more than 10bn yuan ($1.4bn; £1bn) between 2015 and 2023, according to China's highest court, which rejected their appeals in November. Their crimes resulted in the deaths of 14 Chinese citizens and injuries to many others, the court said.\\nMore than 20 others from the Ming family were given jail sentences in September ranging from five years to life. Ming Xuechang, the clan's patriarch, killed himself in 2023 while trying to avoid detention, Myanmar's military had said back then.\\nThe confessions of those who were arrested were aired in state media documentaries, to emphasise Chinese authorities' resolve to eradicate scam networks.\\nThe Mings were among a handful of Godfather-esque families who rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s. This was after the town's then warlord was ousted in a military operation led by Min Aung Hlaing, who became the leader of Myanmar's military government after the 2021 coup.\\nThe head of the family, Ming Xuechang, ran one of the most infamous of Laukkaing's scam centres, Crouching Tiger Villa.\\nAt first gambling and prostitution were the main sources of income for these families, but they eventually started online fraud, staffed mostly by people who were kidnapped and forced to run these scams.\\nWithin the walls of the sprawling, well-guarded compounds was a culture of violence. Beatings and torture were routine, according to testimonies collected from freed workers.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Heartbroken fans of renowned Indian singer Arijit Singh have been paying tribute to him after he announced he would no longer take on new playback assignments, marking the end of a defining chapter in contemporary Bollywood music.\\nSome described his voice as \"the sound of our heartbreaks and celebrations\", while others called it \"a presence in every corner of our lives\".\\nIn Indian cinema, playback singing refers to studio recordings of songs that actors lip‑sync on screen - a bedrock of Bollywood storytelling.\\nSingh\\'s voice became inseparable from that tradition, providing vocals for romantic ballads and chart‑topping soundtracks in recent years.\\nThe 38-year-old, who has collaborated with global pop icons like Ed Sheeran, made his announcement on Instagram on Tuesday.\\n\"I am calling it off. It was a wonderful journey,\" he said.\\nFans then flooded social media with posts reflecting on how his songs, which consistently topped the charts, had become part of India\\'s cultural soundtrack.\\nSingh did not explain why he was quitting playback singing, but reports say he will finish existing commitments and projects and continue making music independently, exploring creative projects beyond commercial cinema.\\nThe decision is unusually bold for a singer at the peak of his career.\\nSingh recently performed to a sold-out crowd at Wembley Arena in London, a milestone few Indian playback singers achieve. His voice - bruised, buttery and intimate - has been an inescapable undercurrent of Bollywood, narrating heartbreaks, longings and reconciliations for millions for more than a decade.\\nYet, even at the height of fame, he chooses to remain on the margins of celebrity culture, visibly ambivalent about his own success.\\nHe rarely gives interviews, avoids publicity stunts and appears in public dressed like someone you might miss entirely: soft-spoken, his face concealed in a hoodie. \"I hate being a celebrity,\" he told Forbes India in an early interview, describing himself as someone who stumbled into fame by accident.\\nSingh was born in 1987 in Jiagang, a small town in West Bengal state, into a household where music was not an aspiration but a daily practice, permeating every aspect of life.\\nHis mother and grandmother were trained classical singers and his aunt also taught music. Classical training came early - he learnt tabla alongside vocal training - but so did exposure to popular music.\\nSingh\\'s first teacher, Birendra Prasad Hazari, recalled him as a toddler at the local music school, eyes fixed on the harmonium before he could even pronounce the notes. Hazari told the Indian newspaper The Telegraph he had \"never come across a singer as talented\", noting the boy\\'s rapid progression from early raga lessons to the voice the world would later know.\\nSingh\\'s first brush with national attention came in 2005 when he appeared on the reality singing show, Fame Gurukul (Fame Academy). He did not win and his presence barely registered. But the setback, in some ways, proved formative.\\nSingh returned to Kolkata city in West Bengal, where he worked as a music programmer and assistant, learning studio work. For several years, he existed on the margins of the industry he would later dominate.\\nWhen recognition finally arrived, it did so with unusual force. In 2013, Singh sang Tum Hi Ho for the film, Aashiqui 2. The song released at a time when Bollywood\\'s romantic music leaned toward scale and spectacle. Singh\\'s voice - inward and raw - had the opposite effect, reintroducing vulnerability to Bollywood audiences as an acceptable emotion.\\nThe song became so popular it outgrew the film to become a national obsession. It was everywhere, flooding radio, weddings and reality shows, the slowbuild, aching notes articulating romantic devotion that felt cinematic yet intensely personal. For months, it felt difficult to move through cities and towns without encountering it.\\nWhat followed was a period of extraordinary success. Overnight, Singh became Bollywood\\'s most relateable voice, recording across many languages - Hindi, Bengali, Tamil and Telugu - and sometimes singing multiple songs in a single film. He collaborated repeatedly with leading composers including Pritam, AR Rahman, Vishal–Shekhar and Amit Trivedi.\\nSingh appeared uncomfortable with the fame that followed and shunned media attention, often skipping award ceremonies.\\nOn stage too he remained informal. At concerts, he chats with the audience, takes requests, sometimes stopping mid-song to adjust the arrangement, or to scold his fans for spending too much time recording, instead of being present.\\nIn his personal life, Singh works with a small team and has chosen to base himself primarily in his hometown - where he\\'s routinely seen slipping out on a scooter to pick up groceries or catching up with old friends - over the glamour of big cities. International visitors, including Dutch DJ Martin Garrix and Sheeran, have reportedly visited his Jiaganj residence.\\nIn recent years, his output has also become more selective, with him choosing to focus more on independent projects.\\nThere was also criticism: some listeners and critics have argued that many of his songs started to sound alike, with his trademark husky, introspective delivery creating a sense of sameness across different films and genres.\\nIn a 2017 interview, Singh admitted he was trying to cut down on projects because he found it \"uncomfortable\" to hear his songs playing everywhere.\\n\"Of course people will be exhausted if you continue to sing 100 songs a year,\" he said.\\nFans are now wondering what comes next.\\nSome interpret this week\\'s announcement as the natural evolution of an artist who finds fame stifling. Others see it as a statement on the pressures of commercial music, or simply the next step in his journey of self-exploration.\\nWhatever the reason, his voice will keep defining music in India.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': \"The sudden death of an influential leader has left a political vacuum in India's richest state.\\nAjit Pawar, the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, died on Wednesday in a plane crash along with four others.\\nMaharashtra's political landscape is notoriously complex - a web of shifting alliances, regional loyalties and rivalries. And for decades, Ajit Pawar navigated it with a mixture of pragmatism and shrewdness, swiftly rising through the ranks.\\nYet, beneath the public triumphs, his journey was also deeply personal: a struggle to emerge out of the formidable shadow of his uncle Sharad Pawar - the founder of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and a dominant figure in Indian politics.\\nBorn in 1959, Ajit Pawar entered politics in the 1980s under his uncle's mentorship, particularly focusing on the Pawar family stronghold of Baramati, a rural area in western Maharashtra where sugar cooperatives, banks and local institutions helped secure both economic influence and political loyalty.\\nFrom an early age, Ajit Pawar was seen as the uncle's visible heir. But he was determined to forge his own path.\\nTo many, Sharad Pawar represented old-school authority: patient and strategic, he was known for his coalition-building skills and political instincts. Ajit Pawar, on the other hand, focused on regional power, governance and control over local political networks.\\nHis style was also markedly different. Where Sharad Pawar spoke in measured tones, Ajit Pawar was blunt and practical, his mercurial personality earning him both loyal supporters and vocal critics.\\nBut as his authority grew, so did his frustration. Ajit Pawar had risen quickly through the ranks of NCP, yet he was often seen as a lieutenant rather than a leader. Decisions were still made by the elder Pawar.\\nThe tensions simmered for years before erupting in public. In 2019, Ajit Pawar shocked Maharashtra by briefly breaking ranks with his uncle and aligning with the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form the government and claim the deputy chief minister's post.\\nHis effort to strike out by himself collapsed within days, undone by Sharad Pawar who intervened to reclaim control of the party and help his allies form the government\\nBut for the first time, the family rift was out in the open. Ajit Pawar returned to the party, but the breach never fully healed.\\nThings finally came to head four years later in 2023, when Ajit Pawar broke away from his uncle's NCP party, joined a new governing coalition led by the BJP and claimed the post of the deputy chief minister once again. This time, he also managed to split his uncle's party and claim the name and electoral symbol of NCP as his own.\\nFrom then, family gatherings dwindled, public appearances were mostly separate, and the Pawar name, once seen as a single axis of power, fractured into two rival camps.\\nFor Ajit Pawar's supporters, the defection was long overdue and a courageous step, reflecting his ability to adapt in India's political system, where even bitter ideological opponents might join hands to come to power. To critics, he symbolised opportunistic politics.\\nThe rupture has since become one of the most remarked-upon political dramas in Maharashtra, one that transformed its fault lines.\\nIn recent days, after civic elections in Pune and Mumbai, conversations had begun about the possibility of a reconciliation between the two factions of the NCP, led by uncle and nephew. Some speculated that Ajit Pawar might even emerge as the leader of a united party.\\nHis sudden death has brought those possibilities to an abrupt halt. Questions now swirl about whether the lawmakers who had left with him will accept the authority of his cousin, Supriya Sule - Sharad Pawar's daughter - or his wife or son, and whether the fragile alliances he nurtured can endure.\\nAjit Pawar leaves behind him a divided political legacy - and a reminder of how personal ambitions and familial ties can shape politics in the most surprising ways.\\nAdditional reporting by Nilesh Dhotre from BBC Marathi\\n\"},\n",

       "  'Article': 'When Sussan Ley made history as the first woman to take the reins of Australia\\'s Liberal Party, she insisted this was a pivotal moment for the party – or what was left of it anyway.\\nShe had broken through the glass ceiling: an invisible, patriarchal barrier which keeps women from positions of power.\\nBut to many, Ley\\'s glass ceiling looked an awful lot like a \"glass cliff\", and it felt like it was only a matter of time before she lost her grip and slipped off it.\\nThe glass cliff describes a phenomenon where women and other minorities are promoted to leadership roles during times of crisis, setting them up for a high risk of failure. In essence, it says that when women are finally allowed to ascend to the top, it\\'s frequently so they can take the fall.\\nElected as leader after the most resounding election defeat in the history of the modern Liberal Party and amid internal party chaos, Ley didn\\'t even survive a year.\\nOn Friday she was pushed out by Angus Taylor, who argued she didn\\'t have what it takes to turn the opposition\\'s fortunes around. He won a leadership ballot 34 to 17, with Senator Jane Hume elected as his deputy.\\nLey\\'s backers claim she was never given the chance to succeed, with some saying gender played a role. Her opponents say her demise has nothing to do with that and everything to do with performance.\\nThe messy saga has reignited conversations in Australia about its progress towards making its politics look more like its population.\\nWhoever took over as Liberal leader after the Labor landslide in May last year was always going to have a tough job.\\nThey had to unify the polarised factions of the party and manage an increasingly toxic relationship with their coalition partner of eight decades, the National Party - a small but vocal and often mutinous cohort of rural MPs.\\nThey had to overhaul a policy platform which was comprehensively rejected by voters. And they had to do this while balancing the demands of the more conservative sects of the Coalition with the more progressive desires of voters in the urban areas where they were ravaged at the polls.\\nThen they also had to repair the Liberals\\' reputation with women, who have deserted them en-masse after a string of allegations of misogyny levelled during the Coaliton\\'s previous term of government, which ended in 2022.\\n\"There was just crisis on every front… it\\'s classic glass cliff,\" says Michelle Ryan, Director of the Global Institute for Women\\'s Leadership and one of the researchers who coined the term.\\nFrom her very first press conference as leader, Ley was aware of what this looked like.\\nShe and her supporters insisted she had been selected exactly for this moment, because she was the right person to lead the Coalition through it.\\nShe is a moderate who can appeal to city slickers, yes, but one from a bush electorate who can speak National. She\\'s been in parliament for 20 years and was a cabinet minister for five. With an unusual but impressive resume that includes time as a pilot and a sheep musterer, Ley says she has spent her entire life breaking down barriers, challenging assumptions and making room for herself in places women weren\\'t always welcome.\\nSome critics say the idea of a glass cliff itself is offensive, that it diminishes women\\'s achievements and assumes they can\\'t successfully lead out of a crisis, when in fact many in the community feel women fare better in them.\\n\"As far as political analysis goes, it is just wrong,\" Ley wrote in an op-ed for the Women\\'s Agenda shortly after she took over.\\n\"There is no doubt that all too often women are left to clean up the mess… But when the most successful political party in our nation\\'s history picks a leader, it doesn\\'t do so based on chromosomes.\\n\"I earned my shot.\"\\nFew are saying she didn\\'t. But the Liberal Party famously passed over Julie Bishop in 2018, an electorally popular and long-serving minister who had been the party deputy for 11 years.\\nPolitical observers say there was a sense Ley was only keeping the seat warm for Taylor, whose first leadership bid failed by a slim margin after a controversial choice in running mate.\\nThe glass cliff phenomenon doesn\\'t paint the true picture of Ley\\'s tenure though, says Niki Savva, a veteran political commentator and former Liberal Party advisor.\\n\"Sometimes I get really impatient with the argument that all this is happening to Ley because she\\'s a woman. She hasn\\'t been given a fair go because she\\'s a woman,\" she tells the BBC.\\n\"Maybe a tiny bit, but that is not the real reason… Sussan Ley is the architect of her own fortunes.\"\\nShe promised not to make unilateral calls as leader, which seemingly opened the door to relentless pressure - public and private - from her peers. She promised to listen to the electorate on climate, but facing opposition from the conservative members of the Coalition, rolled back her party\\'s promise to reach net-zero by 2050.\\nAnd though she played a leading role in pushing the government to hold a royal commission into antisemitism in the wake of the Bondi attack - which she says she\\'s proud of - critics accused her of politicising the tragedy. She also oversaw two short-lived but ugly break-ups between the Liberals and Nationals.\\n\"Political leaders are judged on their performance, not on their gender,\" Liberal Senator, and prominent Taylor backer, James Paterson said on Thursday.\\n\"Newspoll shows she\\'s at negative 39 personal approving approval rating. That is the worst performance of an opposition leader in 23 years.\"\\nThe driver behind her abysmal approval rating, Savva says, is her lack of conviction on issues she said she cared about.\\n\"If she had gone out there and staked out her territory, gone out and fought for it, then maybe her position would not be as dire as it is today.\"\\nRyan, though, argues both things can be true.\\n\"It really isn\\'t about whether Ley is qualified for the job or not… It\\'s not even about her performance in this job,\" Ryan says.\\n\"It\\'s about when is it that the party will put a woman ahead.\"\\nJulia Gillard, the nation\\'s first female prime minister, is the only woman aside from Ley to lead one of its two major parties.\\nShe said at the end of her misogyny-plagued tenure in 2013: \"Being the first female prime minister does not explain everything about my prime ministership, nor does it explain nothing about my prime ministership.\"\\nIt\\'s true that representation in parliament has grown dramatically since Gillard\\'s era – largely driven by her party, Labor, who more than 30 years ago set ambitious quotas, both for selecting female candidates in winnable seats, and promoting them into leadership.\\nWhile the Coalition party rooms remain about a third female, the Labor caucus is now majority women – 57% – a historic achievement. And there is gender equality in cabinet too.\\nBut women are still rare at the very top.\\nAnthony Albanese\\'s leadership team is the first from Labor without at least a female deputy since 2001, aside from a three-month blip in 2013. Albanese was part of that woman-less leadership team too.\\nAnd though Penny Wong is senate leader and foreign minister, women still tend to have more junior cabinet roles or positions in non-cabinet ministries.\\n\"Being able to say we\\'ve had a female prime minister, that\\'s great, we\\'ve just got to get beyond one,\" Ryan says. \"You have to do it again, and then you have to do it again.\"\\nBut over the three decades Labor has used to increase its gender diversity through quotas, doyens of both the Liberal and National parties, even Ley herself, have been arguing they don\\'t need them – to the frustration of many of the women in their ranks.\\nGender shouldn\\'t matter in politics, they say, something which critics say fails to acknowledge the reality that it long has, and still does.\\n\"Instead of, as a woman, getting out there and arguing for quotas, standing up for them, Ley came out with this line, which I just thought was BS, about being a zealot for getting more women into parliament, but agnostic on quotas,\" Savva says.\\n\"Well, what the hell did that mean? And what did she do about it subsequently? Big fat zero.\"\\nAnalysts say this reluctance from the Liberals to champion strong female candidates has helped fuel the rise of independents. More than 70% of crossbench MPs in this parliament are women, many of them so-called \"Teal\" candidates who have won in traditionally blue, Liberal seats.\\nLey, who after the leadership spill announced she would resign from parliament, said there was \"no doubt\" it had been \"a challenging time to lead the party\".\\n\"It is important that the new leader gets clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders,\" she said, a parting jab at her successor.\\nThis episode is unlikely to help resolve the Liberal Party\\'s quandaries.\\nElection post-mortems, as well as consistent feedback from polling and interest groups, point towards the desire for a more diverse Liberal Party that reflects modern Australia, and a more cooperative, stable one.\\nAt best, recent events show disorganisation and disunity, commentators say. At worst, they\\'re another show of a stubborn Liberal Party reluctant to learn from its mistakes.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Tucked away in the rugged Victorian bushland lies the tiny outpost of Licola, population: five.\\nConsisting of a couple of weatherboard buildings, a general store, a caravan park and a petrol station grouped around a modest main street, Licola is one of Australia\\'s smallest towns.\\nAnd if you have a spare couple of million dollars, you can buy it. The entire village - a three-hour drive from the city of Melbourne - is now up for grabs, much to the shock and ire of tight-knit locals.\\nPrivately owned by a local community club, Licola has long been a guaranteed pit stop for fuel, food and rest for travellers on their way to the Alpine National Park. It also has a 50-year legacy of hosting outreach programmes for young people.\\nBut the local branch of the Lions Club says it can\\'t afford to run the town anymore, and late last year quietly listed it for sale online.\\nThe sale has raised alarm bells for Licola\\'s few passionate residents, locals in surrounding areas and even other Lions Clubs state members, who say they weren\\'t fairly consulted and now hold grave fears for the future of the town.\\nNestled beside the banks of the mighty Macalister River in Victoria\\'s high country, Licola was originally a timber mill, built in the 1950s with a few buildings for those working there.\\nAfter it closed in 1968, the Lions Club acquired the whole site and turned it into a camp where disadvantaged young people and children, and groups with special needs, could stay during school holidays.\\nJust around the corner from the camp, they also snapped up land which now hosts Licola\\'s General Store and Caravan Park.\\nToday, Leanne O\\'Donnell - who runs the General Store - and her family are the only full-time residents of the town. She lives there with one of her children, along with her best friend and her two kids.\\n\"It\\'s just an amazing place,\" O\\'Donnell tells the BBC. \"When I first moved here, people would come into my store and say, \\'You\\'re not going to make a million dollars in Licola.\\' And I\\'d say, \\'Who said I\\'m here to make a million dollars?\\'.\"\\nO\\'Donnell purchased the business in 2022 but doesn\\'t own the buildings, signing a lease she says she was led to believe would be extended to a 15-year term.\\nFrom day one, O\\'Donnell wanted Licola to be \"a home away from home\" for people. Nearly every person who visits, works or passes through Licola has O\\'Donnell\\'s number – even truck drivers and the Country Fire Authority.\\n\"I\\'m the main point of contact for them, regardless of whether it\\'s three in the afternoon or two in the morning,\" she said.\\nO\\'Donnell is extremely passionate about the town and serving its surrounding community - but she now faces eviction.\\n\"I absolutely love this town... if it gets into the hands of a developer and turns into something that it\\'s not, it [will] just break my heart.\"\\nO\\'Donnell first learned Licola was headed for the market in January 2025, from the Lions Village Licola board, which is appointed to manage the town on behalf of the charity.\\n\"They told me that their business had been running at a loss for the last five or six years and I asked them, \\'so how can I help you?\\',\" O\\'Donnell says.\\n\"They turned around and said, unless you get a couple of million dollars, there\\'s nothing much you can do.\"\\nBut O\\'Donnell persisted, offering to run fundraisers for the village and telling the board that the broader community will want to help.\\nThe board wouldn\\'t budge, O\\'Donnell says. Eventually she said: \"So you\\'re going to buy my business?\"\\n\"And they said, no, we\\'re just going to take your business because we own the land and we own the buildings,\" she says. \"And you just need to pack up and leave. I couldn\\'t get it in my head and understand it at the time.\"\\nAfter seeking legal advice, O\\'Donnell quickly realised that because she was signed to a lease, the board could do just that.\\n\"In the real world, I could take my business and put it in another building... that\\'s not a problem at all anywhere else except for Licola.\"\\nHere, there is nowhere else to go.\\nBy December, O\\'Donnell found a real estate listing online for the sale of the town, with an asking price of between A$6m (£3m, $4.3m) and $10m.\\nThe sale has been met with intense backlash online from locals in the surrounding areas. Many are upset over the way O\\'Donnell has been treated and are concerned the beloved town could die out or be commercialised.\\nOne user\\'s comment on the Licola Caravan Park & General Store official Facebook page says: \"People rely on the store in town, and closing in the middle of peak season is stupidity at its best.\"\\nAnother person says selling the town \"impacts MANY Victorians that come to Licola and have camped [there] for years\".\\n\"There are some great past leaders of Lions and leaders of the Licola village and camp whom I know are turning in their graves,\" another comment says.\\nOther Victorian Lions members wrote to the Lions Village Licola Board, accusing it of acting without due process and consultation with the broader Lions Club members it is supposed to represent.\\nAn online petition to save the store, \"renew the lease and let Leanne stay\", has more than 8,000 signatures.\\nAs outrage grew, the Lions Village Licola board said its staff were receiving threats and it was considering withdrawing them from the town.\\nIn a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson said the sale was prompted by a review into the town\\'s operations, which was provided to all Lions in Victoria.\\nAfter the review, the board decided it was no longer sustainable for the Lions Club to own the village, listing rising costs and insurance prices, aging accommodation, and a decline in camp attendance as the main reasons.\\n\"The decision to sell was not made lightly,\" the statement said.\\nChairman Denis Carruthers has said the board has a responsibility to protect the mission of the Lions Village - supporting disadvantaged youth - not just the physical space.\\n\"The Lions District Governors have been briefed and are supportive,\" he told the BBC.\\nThe board also said in their statement that O\\'Donnell\\'s lease \"was not renewed in order to consolidate revenue during a period of financial stress\". O\\'Donnell has been told she has to vacate the premises by 31 January this year.\\nAll proceeds of the sale of the Licola properties and future business profits will be reinvested into a new foundation, which will continue to pay for children to attend camps run professionally across Victoria, it said.\\nWhether future camps will continue to run in Licola is unknown at this stage, Carruthers added, with a planned camp for January cancelled due to low numbers.\\nIt remains unclear who the new owners will be – or what they will want to do with the town.\\nBut, he said, there is \"considerable interest in the property\".\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'It\\'s \"extraordinary\", says Chris Pepin-Neff, an expert in policy responses to shark attacks: four shark bites within 48 hours, and three of them within a 15km (9-mile) stretch of Australia\\'s east coast.\\nOn 18 January, a 12-year-old boy was taken to hospital with critical injuries and later died after being attacked while swimming in Sydney Harbour. The next day, an 11-year-old\\'s surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition.\\nThen, on 20 January, a fourth surfer \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board some 300km up the coast.\\n\"This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I\\'ve ever seen in my 20 years of research,\" says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney.\\nThe succession of incidents caused alarm and dozens of beaches have been closed because of fears of more attacks. Calls for shark culls have gathered momentum.\\nExperts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans\\' relationship to these fish.\\nMany factors may have contributed to the recent series of incidents, they say – and the sharks are not the problem.\\nNon-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both.\\nThe three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days\\' worth of heavy rain, during which the city\\'s official weather station recorded 127mm of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years.\\nJodie Rummer, Professor of Marine Biology at James Cook University, says such weather could have created attractive conditions for sharks.\\n\"Storms and river outflows create flood plumes that carry nutrients and fish into coastal waters, which can attract prey species and, in turn, predators like sharks,\" she tells the BBC.\\n\"Coastal species, like bull sharks and some whaler sharks are particularly known to move toward these plumes because they are following food and favourable conditions, not people.\"\\nRebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University whose research specialises in recreational sport and leisure in areas such as oceans, estuaries and rivers, said conditions would have been \"perfect\" for bull sharks.\\n\"Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,\" she told the BBC. \"They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them.\"\\nOlive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks.\\n\"There\\'s clearly an attractant in the water,\" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a \"perfect storm\" of low salinity freshwater could have created a \"biodiversity explosion\".\\n\"The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody\\'s in the near shore area – and now we have a problem.\"\\nOfficial statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards.\\nThat doesn\\'t mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.\\nThese include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.\\nAs Rummer explains: \"We have more people in the water than ever before, which naturally increases the chance of encounters.\"\\n\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.\\nThey also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn\\'t tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".\\nOlive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".\\nIf it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.\\nPepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people\\'s understanding of the risk.\\nWhen shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.\\n\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words \\'shark attack\\',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"\\nIn the wake of Sydney\\'s recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.\\n\"Three shark attacks in three days in Sydney. This didn\\'t happen because of the weather or the time of day, it happened because there are too many sharks,\" former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott posted to Facebook following the recent series of attacks. \"It\\'s way past time to reintroduce the shark fishery.\"\\nThe Australian state of Queensland already uses lethal measures as part of its statewide shark control program. A recent report from KPMG found that between 2024 and 1962, when the program began, there was an average of 2.3 shark \"incidents\" and 0.35 deaths per year in the state. Before 1962, there was an average of three bites and one death per year.\\nWhile the report noted the evidence was correlative, and did not necessarily prove lethal measures caused a reduction in attacks, the Queensland Government has used it to justify the expansion of its shark control program.\\nAmong experts, however, the efficacy and overall benefits of shark culls are broadly rejected.\\nA peer-reviewed analysis of 67 shark-bite mitigation studies – due to be published in next month\\'s Marine Policy journal – found little evidence that lethally removing sharks reduces shark bites or lowers attack risk.\\nThis echoes what numerous other marine and ecological experts have been saying for years: that reducing shark attacks is not as simple as reducing shark populations.\\nAn oft-cited study into shark control programs in Hawaiian waters, where thousands of sharks were removed over nearly two decades, showed that such programs \"do not appear to have had measurable effects on the rate of shark attacks\".\\nAs Rob Harcourt, emeritus professor of marine ecology at Macquarie University, recently told the university\\'s news platform: \"Culling the shark population won\\'t do anything\".\\n\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I\\'m strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.\\nPepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that \"It just doesn\\'t work\".\\n\"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"\\nIn cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that\\'s drawing them to the area.\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there\\'s a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark\\'s going to come in.\"\\nRummer, Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.\\nMore broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.\\n\"In Australia we\\'ve got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"\\nThis will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.\\n\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it\\'s the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.\\n\"We\\'re in the way, not on the menu.\"\\nUpdate 18 February: This article has been updated to include comments from a marine biologist. We have also added further context on shark culling practices and expanded on the roles of Chris Pepin‑Neff and Rebecca Olive.\\n'},\n",

Populist leaders came to rail against immigration. Prominent businesspeople popped by to pose with flowers.\\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese, accused by many Jewish Australians of ignoring their concerns ahead of the attack, spent the weeks after it dismissing calls from many in the community for a national inquiry into antisemitism.\\nHe was repeatedly heckled in public, arriving at a memorial to a tidal wave of boos and cries of \"You\\'re not welcome\". \"You might as well go to a jihadist nation where you can fit in,\" one person shouted. Looming over the crowd, a large screen read \"a night of unity\".\\nCriticised as being overly defensive and slow to listen, Albanese has in turn rebuked his parliamentary rivals for \"playing politics\" with tragedy.\\nThe 14 December Bondi attack was Australia\\'s worst mass shooting since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, when 35 people were killed, but the responses to the tragedies couldn\\'t be more different.\\nThen Prime Minister John Howard visited the scene of the shooting in Tasmania to lay wreaths together with opposition leaders, who shortly afterwards united to help him pass firearms laws that made Australia a world leader on gun control.\\n\"Australian society and politics is very different than it was 30 years ago and we\\'re just a far more divided society,\" says John Warhurst, an emeritus professor of political science at the Australian National University.\\nThere are a number of reasons why this attack has divided people in ways Port Arthur didn\\'t - including the already fraught debate raging in Australia over Israel, Gaza and antisemitism, according to Mark Kenny, a political columnist and host of the Democracy Sausage podcast.\\n\"Then this event lobs into that, [and] I think it led to it being immediately politicised,\" he told the BBC.\\nSince the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas and protests in Australia against Israel\\'s war on Gaza which followed, Albanese has consistently been accused of failing to do enough to stamp out antisemitism. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry says antisemitic incidents have increased from an average of 342 before the 7 October attacks in 2023 to 1,654 last year.\\nLikewise, he\\'s been accused of not doing enough to call out Israel\\'s actions in Gaza, which UN experts have called genocide and Israel denies.\\nHours after the Bondi shooting, the antisemitism commissioner appointed by Albanese linked it to the pro-Palestinian protests that have regularly taken place in Sydney and which Jewish leaders have lobbied against.\\n\"It began on 9 October 2023 at the Sydney Opera House,\" Jillian Segal said in a statement. \"Now death has reached Bondi Beach.\"\\nInvestigators have not said there is any link between the alleged gunmen and the pro-Palestinian movement, instead alleging the pair were inspired by the jihadist group Islamic State, with the younger of the father-son duo on intelligence agencies\\' radars for a period in 2019.\\nAs it was after Port Arthur, gun reform was the first thing on the legislative agenda after the Bondi attack.\\n\"We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney\\'s suburbs... There\\'s no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns,\" Albanese said as he announced a suite of changes in the following days.\\nUnlike Port Arthur, when the measures were broadly popular, Albanese\\'s focus on gun laws was immediately\\u202fattacked by the Liberal opposition and\\u202fparts of the Jewish community\\u202fas a distraction from what they view as the real cause of the attack – antisemitism.\\u202fEven Howard, the architect of the 1996 reforms, came out to suggest they were an \"attempted diversion\".\\n\"That kind of \\'either or ism\\' is a feature about politics these days probably everywhere in the West. Everything becomes supercharged and divisive,\" says Kenny.\\n\"There\\'s just this fundamental lack of trust that\\'s almost like we\\'re in the grip of a toxic cynicism that means that motives of political leaders… the first instinct is to question them, to regard them as disingenuous.\"\\nThe recent decision by a festival in Adelaide to disinvite a Palestinian-Australian author – leading ultimately to the collapse of the entire writers\\' week portion of the event – due to \"sensitivities\" after Bondi and her \"past statements\" is also a sign of how tense the current circumstances are, adds Kenny.\\nDemands for immediate action on antisemitism were loud in the days after the attack, and Albanese did soon announce a crackdown on hate speech, backed by the antisemitism commissioner.\\nBut some critics said the\\u202fmeasures\\u202fwould impinge on free speech, including the right to criticise\\u202fIsrael,\\u202fand\\u202fon\\u202fprotest,\\u202fwhile others argued they did not go far enough in protecting other\\u202fminorities.\\n\"[It\\'s] a can of worms,\" says Warhurst, noting that there has never been \"an easy agreement on finding where that balance lies\" between free speech and hate speech.\\n\"Now is the worst time, I think, to be trying to resolve those sorts of issues because you are doing it fairly quickly and you\\'re doing it in a heated environment.\"\\nThe hate speech laws had the backing of the Jewish community, but many felt it was not enough - with several of the victims\\' families\\u202fpushing Albanese to call a royal commission, Australia\\'s most powerful form of independent inquiry.\\nFor weeks, Albanese argued the\\u202fmeasures\\u202falready\\u202fannounced\\u202fwere\\u202fenough\\u202fand that a royal commission would be the wrong tool to unpick what had happened. It could give a platform to antisemites, he said.\\nRoyal commissions had not been\\u202flaunched into previous tragedies like Port Arthur, Albanese pointed out, comments which were widely dismissed. Promised reviews of intelligence agencies and law enforcement similarly did nothing to dissuade those calling for the inquiry.\\nTheir pleas were mirrored by a coordinated campaign of letter writing that featured on the front pages of right-wing newspapers.\\u202f\"I don\\'t think it\\'s controversial to say that the News Limited and other parts of the media were certainly stirring the pot,\" says\\u202fWarhurst.\\nAlbanese\\'s arguments against a royal commission were \"really hard to make in these circumstances\", says Kenny, and it backfired on him\\u202fwhen he was\\u202fultimately\\u202fforced to\\u202freverse course\\u202fon the issue.\\nAnalysts have also suggested his reluctance may have been down to fears it could become complex, controversial and divisive. It could\\u202finvite\\u202fdiscussion of the\\u202fwar in\\u202fGaza, while potentially excluding examination of Islamophobia – which exploded after Bondi, with The Islamophobia Register Australia recording a 740% rise in incidents by early January - when many Labor MPs have large Muslim electorates.\\nThere was\\u202flikely also\\u202fa \"reluctance to cave to the opposition\", Farr believes: opposition leader Sussan Ley had vociferously demanded the royal commission, asking what Albanese was \"hiding\",\\u202fand revelled in his backflip.\\nIt is fair to say that, before December\\'s attack, Ley had been struggling to land a punch on the government and assert authority over her own party. In the weeks before the shooting, some pundits were even predicting her imminent ousting.\\n\"The Bondi attacks offered her an opportunity to prosecute a very strong case against the government,\" says Kenny.\\nBut any momentum she gained over the royal commission collapsed this week when she failed to rally her Coalition behind the very hate speech laws she had so loudly demanded Albanese quickly implement.\\nBy Thursday - the national day of mourning for the Bondi attacks - things had fallen apart.\\nThe National Party announced they were leaving the coalition, having refused to vote for the legislation despite a shadow cabinet agreement. They, despite earlier calls for haste, said they had not been given enough time to examine the proposals which they said could threaten free speech.\\nOn his way out the door, Nationals leader David Littleproud suggested the only way his party would consider returning to the fold was if Ley was dumped, leaving her already shaky leadership hanging by a thread.\\n\"I\\'m quite sure there are people... who are polishing their shoes and tightening the knot on their ties to step forward should that vacancy occur or be forced,\" says Farr.\\nHowever, Littleproud\\'s bold ultimatum could be an overstep which costs him his own job, with mutterings that Liberals wouldn\\'t accept him as a leader in any future coalition either.\\nBut then, it seems all of Australia\\'s politicians may be on shakier ground.\\nThe posturing of the main parties over the past month has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Australians. In a poll released earlier this week, Albanese\\'s net approval rating had plunged to minus 11 from his previous score of zero in November, while Ley\\'s approval rating - never high - barely budged at minus 28.\\nThe repeated calls for unity by politicians who simultaneously fail to heed their own statements will not have gone unnoticed, and Thursday\\'s display of political infighting is unlikely to improve the fortunes of any party, says Farr.\\n\"It will reinforce the view of so many Australians who already are cynical about what politicians, no matter their party, actually represent and will reinforce the belief that politicians, MPs, just stand for themselves rather than the national good.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'From the outside, the vacant shop on the corner of a busy avenue in central Sydney looks abandoned. Plastic sheeting is taped across all the windows and there\\'s a large padlock hanging on the door handle.\\nStep inside, though, and you\\'re greeted by cuddly toys, candles, trinkets and messages of hope scribbled on large sheets.\\nAll of them come from a makeshift memorial that was created after the 14 December attack at Bondi Beach that killed 15 people.\\nSo when the Sydney Jewish Museum and the Australian Jewish Historical Society heard that the memorial would be removed by the local council, they sprang into action to ensure everything contained within it could live on.\\nMany of the items now live in neat squares made out of masking tape on the shop floor.\\nOne says \"bees\" - within it are dozens of knitted and cuddly insects - a nod to 10-year-old Matilda Bee, the youngest victim of the attack.\\nAnother has a heap of deflated foil balloons – again, mostly bees.\\nThere\\'s also a box of stones – Jewish mourners traditionally place a stone on a grave instead of flowers – as well as flags, books, Christmas decorations and even a Barbie cracker.\\nSome families who were unable to go to any of the vigils in Bondi have also paid a visit to the spaces housing the tributes.\\n\"It was too overwhelming to be in Bondi, but in this space it was very quiet. And I think to see everything laid out and the amount, they found it really moving and meaningful,\" said Shannon Biederman, the senior curator at the Sydney Jewish Museum.\\nFamilies also came to the flower space and were given flower pressing to do, while artists and community members joined in too.\\nFor Shannon, memorialising the items is a deeply personal task.\\nHer family were regular attendees of Chanukah by the Sea - the festival targeted by the alleged gunmen. They had bought tickets to go but at the last minute, they changed their mind.\\nThey also knew the family of Rabbi Eli Schlanger, one of the 15 victims.\\n\"I do work in a Holocaust museum, so the murder of Jews isn\\'t something that I\\'m not used to, and I\\'ve learned to compartmentalise,\" she says.\\n\"But it\\'s different because I\\'m used to working with history and this is now, and we are a museum of memory, but we\\'re still very much live in [this].\\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the first to lay a bouquet in front of the Bondi Pavilion the morning after the attack. Over the course of a week, the tributes spread like a wave across the forecourt.\\nThe massacre at Bondi was Australia\\'s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades and left the country reeling. It also saw people pointing the blame at the government for letting something like this happen to a community that had been repeatedly warning authorities about a rise in antisemitism in recent years.\\nBut the conversation is now trying to focus on bringing people together - a sentiment the community wants to see continued in a permanent memorial to the dead.\\nOn Thursday, landmarks across the country will also be lit up and a minute\\'s silence held in honour of the victims. Australians are also being asked to perform a mitzvah – an everyday act of kindness such as checking in on a neighbour or a donation - a Jewish tradition and a way to bring people together after last month\\'s attack.\\nHow the memorial will live on is still unclear – several artists have come forward, keen to work with some of the material but a committee will make the final decisions.\\nAnd while the toys and trinkets were catalogued - there was the greater challenge of dealing with the flowers that had been left behind.\\nVolunteers helped to preserve the three tonnes of bouquets and wreaths that were loaded into black bags and taken to a separate warehouse in North Sydney.\\nThe process was confronting, says Nina Sanadze, a Jewish artist from Melbourne, whose idea it was to save all the flowers and oversaw the operation.\\n\"When they brought them here, they looked like 100 bodies,\" Nina says. \"It was shocking again.\"\\nOnce at the warehouse, dozens of volunteers began the slow process of hanging them up on metal fences that had also been sourced in haste.\\nThey also had to wear masks to protect themselves from the large amount of pollen circulating.\\nShannon also feared that the sheer quantity of flowers and the gases they were emitting could create a compost fire, so volunteers had to monitor temperatures carefully and brought in fans.\\n\"The smell and the moisture here in the warehouse was overwhelming,\" says Nina. \"It was like being inside a perfume shop.\"\\nMeanwhile the flowers kept on coming.\\n\"After the council made decision to clean up this big collection of flowers, people continued to bring them,\" explains Nina. \"We had volunteers to go at night and collect them otherwise they\\'d get thrown away.\"\\nThe stalks have been saved for compost – which Nina says she\\'s considering turned into some kind of furniture.\\nSome of the rose buds had also started to rot, but she\\'s dried them out and made a resin artwork scattered with the salvageable petals.\\n\"There\\'s a lot of decay and sadness as well as beauty,\" she says of her improvised creation. \"[It] takes it straight into the storytelling of what happened - it\\'s not a thing of perfect beauty but it\\'s a story, it\\'s a heartbreak and love all together.\"\\nThough a heavy task, for many of the volunteers, helping preserve the mountain of tributes left at the site is a form of therapy.\\nAnd while the concept for the memorial is still germinating, Nina has already pinned down the title.\\n\"Petal by Petal,\" she says confidently. It speaks to the way volunteers have had to methodically go about preserving the material, and symbolises her own slow processing of the attack.\\n\"I started with a lot of anger coming here,\" Nina admits. \"I feel like I\\'m leaving in better spirits.\"\\nShe hopes the resulting artworks and memorials can help the community do the same.\\n\"It can soften hearts, it can communicate,\" she says. \"And one of the things with flowers is not only they speak of the fragility of humans, but also they have no language, everybody understands flowers.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The interview with Julie Inman Grant is yet to start - she is not even in the room - when the conversation turns to the barrage of death and rape threats her office deals with on a weekly basis.\\nThe job of heading up Australia\\'s eSafety Commission has put her squarely on the frontlines of internet battles - over fake news, censorship, trolling and children\\'s safety.\\nThe online world can be a \"cesspit\", a colleague admits, noting the vast majority of abuse lobbed their way is targeted at Inman Grant personally.\\n\"Unfortunately, I\\'ve been living that reality for the past several years,\" the 57-year-old tells me herself a few minutes later, in her office overlooking Sydney Harbour.\\nAfter decades spent working in the private tech industry, Inman Grant now finds herself on the other side: holding some of the world\\'s most successful companies accountable as head of Australia\\'s independent online safety regulator.\\nIt has arguably made her the country\\'s most famous bureaucrat. But it\\'s also made her a target.\\nShe was doxxed by neo-Nazi groups, has sparred publicly with Elon Musk and has even drawn the ire of some in the US Congress.\\nAll that while being tasked with implementing the country\\'s pioneering social media ban on teenagers - or, in simpler words, kicking every Australian under the age of 16 off social media.\\nInman Grant\\'s job has always been a high-stakes one but, with the world watching how Australia\\'s social media experiment turns out, now more so than ever.\\nTen platforms come under the legislation, which came into force on 10 December, including Meta\\'s Facebook and Instagram, as well as Snapchat and YouTube.\\nParents across Australia have widely supported the policy. For many, having the government on their side helps when they are at loggerheads with pre-teens desperate to get on to social media.\\nBut there are plenty of critics. Technology experts and child wellbeing advocates have voiced concern, saying children need to be educated, not banned from platforms.\\nMany question the ban\\'s enforceability and say it unfairly excludes minority groups such as rural kids, disabled teenagers and those who identify as LGBTQI+ - all of whom are more likely to find their communities online.\\nUnsurprisingly, none of the companies are hugely supportive either. Across the board, they have said they share the government\\'s concerns about online safety and will comply with the law, but don\\'t think a \"ban\" is the way to go.\\nInman Grant argues anything that could help protect children online is worth trying.\\n\"If we can delay [kids\\'] entry into social media for three years, and we can supplement that with digital action plans so that we\\'re building their critical reasoning skills and resilience, then that\\'s something that I think is worth exploring,\" she says.\\nIt\\'s at this point she often likes to compare the digital world with the open water - a clever tactic, perhaps, to draw in Australians proud of their relationship with the ocean and their beautiful beaches.\\n\"Just like with water safety, we have to continue teaching our kids to swim until they\\'re strong swimmers,\" she says. \"We need to teach them about risks, like algorithmic rips. We need to teach them about predators in the water. It\\'s sharks online, it\\'s paedophiles and other scammers.\"\\nBut she\\'s also used the water analogy to argue against a ban in the past.\\n\"We do not fence the ocean or keep children entirely out of the water but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,\" she said in June 2024, while the government was still weighing up the ban.\\n\"I actually had to come around to it,\" she admits now. After pushing to be given freedom in how it was rolled out, she was persuaded. And her role has been central in shaping which companies will be included and how they must comply.\\nShe jokes her own home, which she shares with three children, including 13-year-old twins, has become a \"laboratory\". \"I had one [child] that wasn\\'t really fussed about the idea, but another who thought the sky was falling [in] that her Instagram and her Snapchat might be taken away.\"\\nShe\\'s not put off though. \"They\\'re in the midst of figuring out who they are, building their identities,\" she says.\\n\"I was able to screw up as a teenager and not have it filmed and amplified all over the place.\"\\nInman Grant\\'s own formative years were spent in the orbit of the tech world. She grew up in the US city of Seattle, the home of Microsoft and Amazon.\\nIt\\'s perhaps little surprise then that she fell into this line of work, after briefly flirting with the idea of working for the CIA.\\nShe took a job at Capitol Hill, advising a US congressman on telecommunications and technology. From there, she did a masters in international communication before taking a job with Microsoft.\\nIt was a posting at Microsoft that brought her to Australia in the early 2000s, just as the social media scene was starting to flourish. Here, she met her husband and has now become an Australian citizen.\\nAs part of her work with Microsoft, Inman Grant looked for security vulnerabilities and safety breaches. After 17 years, she moved to Twitter\\'s Australian operation and then briefly to Adobe.\\nWhile these tech companies were booming as the use of smartphones and apps proliferated, she felt there was an elephant in the room. Safety, she believed, wasn\\'t being prioritised. This was an era without government regulators.\\n\"[So] I tried to change things from the inside out.\"\\nAfter more than two decades, she decided to see whether change could happen from the outside instead.\\nWhen the job of eSafety Commissioner came up, she bashfully explains there was a small pool of candidates to choose from. The man who helped write the bill, Malcolm Turnbull, went on to become prime minister. He hired her and, she says, wanted a commissioner with a background in online safety, but also experience in the tech sector itself.\\n\"[The government] didn\\'t think you could be an effective regulator unless you knew the people and you knew the levers and you knew how they were thinking and you could anticipate their moves,\" she recalls.\\n\"[You have] to understand that all of this is driven by revenue and growth and who has the power in the companies.\"\\nThe role is one that has since been championed by politicians of all stripes, in what many see as a testament to how Inman Grant has managed the office. And especially so in a period that has seen scrutiny on the internet safety watchdog grow dramatically, its budget quadruple, and its remit and staff expand exponentially.\\n\\'[It\\'s] frankly an extraordinary tenure in what is a fast-moving, pretty unforgiving type of space for a regulator,\" Inman Grant\\'s predecessor Alastair MacGibbon says of her work. \"The office has just become more relevant by the day.\"\\nFormer Communications Minister Paul Fletcher, who helped appoint Inman Grant and worked with her closely for several years, said she has tackled the personally demanding role with vigour and courage.\\n\"People take it for granted in a modern Western nation, that if you\\'re assaulted or robbed or something else bad happens to you in the physical town square that you can get redress,\" he told the BBC.\\n\"The rule of law needs to apply in the digital town square as well as in the physical town square, and the eSafety Commissioner is really a very clear manifestation of that.\"\\nWhile Australia sees itself as a world leader in the online safety space, some tech companies, headquartered in other parts of the world, have long accused the country of overreach.\\n\"We\\'ve been regulating big tech for online safety for 10 years, and for the first seven years, we were the only ones,\" Inman Grant says.\\nAs we speak, Inman Grant is resisting a request from the US Congress to testify about Australia\\'s social media ban laws and has been referred to by the Republican House judiciary chair as a \"noted zealot for global takedowns\" who \"threatens [the] speech of American citizens\". Jim Jordan has even threatened her with contempt charges if she refuses to give evidence.\\nInman Grant says she\\'s not responsible for defending the policy, and can only really speak to its implementation: \"Nothing that we do here affects the ability of American companies to show any content that they like to Americans.\"\\nShe is also preparing to fight at least two High Court challenges against the ban - one from online forum Reddit and another from a pair of Australian teens - while also pursuing companies found in breach of the nation\\'s array of online safety laws through the courts.\\nThis, though, is far from her first rodeo.\\nIn 2024, after a bishop was stabbed in Sydney during a service that was livestreamed, Inman Grant asked for the video to be taken down from X. The company\\'s owner, Elon Musk, refused.\\nInstead, he called her a \"censorship commissar\" to his millions of followers and the abuse towards her reached a whole new level.\\nA report by Columbia University found Inman Grant was the target of tens of thousands of abusive posts, including death and rape threats. On 23 April 2024 alone, the report counted 73,694 mentions of Inman Grant or the eSafety Commissioner\\'s office on X. Before then, the daily average was just 145.\\nWhile eventually the video was geo-blocked in Australia, it was still available around the world. The internet watchdog took X to court, but the case was ultimately dropped.\\nShe tells the BBC it\\'s a cautionary tale. Police in the UK say the very same video was watched by Axel Rudakubana shortly before he stabbed three girls to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport later that year.\\n\"[This kind of content] normalises, it desensitises, and it sometimes radicalises,\" she says. \"At some point you have to take a stand.\"\\nBut even as she and her office grapple with pulling off Australia\\'s social media ban, Inman Grant is gearing up for new battles, now zeroing in on artificial intelligence (AI).\\nThe world was \"late to the game\" with social media regulation, and it cannot afford to do that with AI, she explains.\\n\"That\\'s going to be the next and a much more pressing threat, to be honest.\"\\nBut she may not be in the job long enough to see the fruits of that fight. She has been commissioner for nearly a decade now. Her second five-year term comes to an end next year.\\n\"I think it will probably be time to hand over the reins to someone else. As I said, this takes a lot of resolve and a lot of resilience. It\\'s been the privilege and the honour of a lifetime.\"\\nBefore tech companies breathe a sigh of relief though, she hints she won\\'t be swayed from her career-long mission of making the tech world safer.\\n\"Maybe that means helping other governments establish online safety regulation and helping companies really embed safety by design.\"\\n'},\n",

He is six now and still thinks I am really cool.\\n\"So I probably only have another seven or so years of that, I want to make the most of it.\"\\nAccording to the NHS website, Q fever is a bacterial infection you can catch from infected farm animals such as sheep, cattle and goats. It\\'s usually harmless, but it can cause serious problems.\\nSome people get flu-like symptoms within two to three weeks of being infected, including a high temperature, aching muscles, tiredness and feeling sick.\\nIt is most often spread to humans by close contact with infected farm animals, especially through their blood, urine, faeces and animal skin, fur and wool.\\nAlthough Q fever is rare, people who work closely with animals are more at risk, such as farmers, vets, stable hands and abattoir workers.\\nThere is currently no licensed vaccine for Q fever available in the UK.\\nChronic Q fever sometimes leads to serious heart problems, such as endocarditis.\\n'},\n",

It didn\\'t emphasise the need for Cauchi to see a psychiatrist or that an urgent review of his case should be a priority.\\nO\\'Sullivan\\'s recommendation that Boros-Lavack be investigated by Queensland health authorities followed calls by some of the victim\\'s families for such action.\\nShe also found there was a missed opportunity for police intervention after an email raising concerns about Cauchi\\'s mental health was not acted upon due to staff shortages .\\nThe officer \"overlooked a single email amidst a significant workload\", O\\'Sullivan said.\\nThe inquest heard a security guard who was the sole person in the CCTV control room at the Westfield when Cauchi attacked his first victim was \"not competent\" for that role. However, O\\'Sullivan said this was the fault of the shopping centre, which has since improved its processes.\\nAmong her 23 recommendations, O\\'Sullivan also called on the NSW government to improve its mental health outreach services and provide short-term housing for people with mental health issues.\\nThe coroner praised the police and emergency services response to the stabbings, describing them as \"commendably rapid and extensive\" but said there were issues with the \"inter-operability\" between various agencies that could be improved.\\nShe also recommended a public awareness campaign with the message of \"escape, hide, tell\" when there is a situation with an armed offender.\\nO\\'Sullivan, though, did criticise some media coverage, which she said \"exacerbated the trauma already being suffered\" by victims and families affected, and said she would be making recommendations to the Australian Press Council on how reporters should cover incidents that involve mass casualties.\\nThe coroner also recommended bravery awards for the police officer who shot Cauchi, two Frenchmen who tried to stop Cauchi during the attack, the husband of victim Jade Young, and Ashlee Good, who died while trying to shield her baby.\\nOutside the court, Noel McLaughlin - Young\\'s husband - said the inquest mattered greatly.\\n\"The evidence has shown that what first appeared to be a sudden and random act of violence was, in fact, the end point of a long story,\" he said.\\nEarlier, Cauchi\\'s parents released a statement, saying they hoped the coroner\\'s findings would prevent such a tragedy happening again.\\n'},\n",

It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly.\"\\nFinding themselves drifting further and further out from Quindalup beach, in Western Australia, Joanne realised she needed to do something - but she couldn\\'t leave Beau, 12, and Grace, eight, alone.\\n\"Early on, we sent this young man back in to try and get help because it didn\\'t look like we were that far from the shoreline,\" she said.\\nAustin took the kayak, but no one realised it had been badly damaged and was already taking on water.\\n\"It started flipping, and then I lost an oar and I knew I was in trouble,\" he recalled. \"I started paddling with my arm.\"\\nAt one point, he managed to get the kayak to work - before it threw him for the last time.\\nClinging to the capsized kayak, Austin - who swears he \"saw something in the water\" - realised he needed to do something.\\n\"It was getting dangerous now - I had been out for a couple of hours.\"\\nHe had lost sight of his family, who had also lost sight of him. As Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, the waves got bigger and bigger, making it harder to stay on the boards, while visibility had also got worse. They were all wearing life jackets - but they had no food or water.\\n\"I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,\" she said. \"As the day progressed, no vessels and nothing coming to save us.\\n\"If he hasn\\'t made it, what have I done, have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?\"\\nAustin, meanwhile, had started to swim the last 4km (two nautical miles), abandoning his own lifejacket after a time because it was not helping him.\\nThroughout the next two hours, it was prayer, Christian songs and \"happy thoughts\" which kept the \"really scared\" 13-year-old going.\\n\"I was thinking about mum, Beau and Grace. I was also thinking about my friends and my girlfriend - I have a really good bunch of friends,\" he said.\\n\"When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now - is this a dream?\"\\nThen he had another thought: his family \"could still be alive out there - I have to go save them\".\\nIt was about 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) when he finally reached his mother\\'s bag and rang for help.\\nThe call sparked a huge search, police said in a statement on Monday.\\nAustin - who had passed out after making the call - was taken to hospital where he called his father, bawling his eyes out. He still didn\\'t know if Joanne and his siblings were alive.\\nThen, minutes later, he got a call to say they had been found. Everyone - doctors and police officers - were jumping up and down with joy.\\n\"It was a moment I will never forget,\" said Austin.\\nOut at sea, Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children. They were freezing cold, and it was now dark. She now feared the worst had happened to Austin.\\n\"We couldn\\'t see anything coming to save us,\" she said. \"It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.\"\\nJoanne couldn\\'t even relax when she saw the boat approaching: the children had fallen into the water and she was desperately trying to reach them.\\n\"It was an absolute nightmare,\" she said.\\nBack on dry land, they were treated at hospital for minor injuries. The same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm - finally - he too had survived.\\nHe\\'s even been back at school - admittedly on crutches, as his legs were so sore.\\nNow, less than five days later, Austin is still trying to process what happened. He certainly doesn\\'t see himself as a hero, despite what people keep telling him. It was, he acknowledged, a \"tough battle\".\\nHis praise is reserved for the \"lovely ambulance crew\" and the \"really quick response\" from triple zero, the emergency services.\\nOthers, however, have been effusive with their praise for Austin.\\nNaturaliste Volunteer Marine Rescue Group\\'s commander Paul Bresland described the efforts of the teenager as \"superhuman\".\\nMeanwhile, Insp James Bradley said his actions \"cannot be praised highly enough - his determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings\".\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Social media platforms do not want Australia\\'s landmark social media ban to be successful in case it incentivises other countries to follow suit, the nation\\'s internet regulator has told the BBC.\\n\"These companies have come to this regime, if you will, kicking and screaming - very very reluctantly,\" eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.\\nAustralia began forcing social media firms to block users aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms in December, a policy being closely watched by other world governments.\\nThe UK is considering similar legislation; this week, the House of Lords voted to support a ban for under-16s via an amendment to the government\\'s schools bill.\\nAustralia\\'s ban was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.\\nCompanies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online, but do not think a blanket ban is the answer, with some experts raising similar concerns.\\nIn an update earlier this month, the Australian government said 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children had already been shut down, declaring the policy a huge success.\\nInman Grant told the BBC children had proved to be an \"incredibly lucrative\" market for social media platforms, noting the addictive properties of platforms that were initially designed for adults.\\n\"They\\'re building a pipeline for the future, and they do not want this to be the first domino,\" she said, adding that they do not have a \"huge incentive\" to \"perfectly\" comply with the ban.\\n\"We\\'ve always had to play a bit of a dance with the tech companies, clearly they don\\'t like to be regulated.\"\\nWith the legislation coming into effect just over a month ago, Inman Grant said researchers were still carefully monitoring the resulting shifts in behaviour among young people.\\nOne criticism had been that under-16s would simply migrate to other platforms following the ban, but Inman Grant said the data indicated otherwise. While there was an initial spike in downloads of other social media applications, she claimed there has been no sustained uptick in their usage.\\nAnother concern had been that children would circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that is performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.\\nUnder the law, firms face fines of up to A$49.5m ($33m, £24.5m) if they fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep children off their platforms, and Inman Grant said a second series of concerns notices is about to be sent to companies, naming the platform Snapchat as a key focus.\\n\"We\\'re starting to see some anomalies and weaknesses and I will probe those,\" she said.\\n\"There are some kids that are getting through Snapchat, which is one that has been a primary focus for now,\" she said, adding that she needed to probe whether the platform had implemented its settings in the right way.\\n\"[The policy] is certainly exceeding our expectations, but we are playing the long game here,\" she said, adding that regulators will always have to take a dynamic approach to the safety of young people online.\\nInman Grant also told the BBC that Australia was working with \"like-minded\" countries such as the UK to take a stand against platforms where \"terrorist violent content is openly available to young children\".\\nShe gave the example of Southport killer Axel Rudakubana who was found to have accessed graphic footage of the stabbing of Australian bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel on X, before leaving home to carry out the attack.\\n\"When terrorist violent content is so openly available to young children it normalises, it desensitises and it sometimes radicalises - at some point you have to take a stand.\"\\nAustralia is not the first country to experiment with limiting children\\'s use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, it is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world\\'s strictest.\\nTen platforms are currently included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch.\\nIt currently does not include dating websites, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord, or AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.\\nSocial media platforms have regularly pushed back on the legislation, with Meta arguing that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.\\nThough Reddit has complied with the ban, it has also launched a challenge in Australia\\'s highest court, where it will argue that the policy has serious implications for privacy and political rights.\\nAustralia\\'s Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats.\\n\"We will not be intimidated by big tech.

This included misogynistic and violent material as well as content promoting eating disorders and suicide.\\nOne in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victim of cyberbullying.\\nTen platforms are currently included: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch.\\nThe government assesses potential sites against three main criteria:\\nwhether the platform\\'s sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users;\\nwhether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and\\nwhether it allows users to post material\\nYouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp have not been included as they were not deemed to meet those criteria.\\nUnder-16s are also still able to view most content on online platforms that do not require an account.\\nCritics have called on the government to extend the ban to cover online gaming sites like Roblox and Discord, which are not currently included.\\nIn November 2025, Roblox said it would introduce age checks on some features.\\nChildren and parents are not punished for infringing the ban.\\nInstead, social media companies face fines of up to A$49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches.\\nThe government says firms must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and should use multiple age assurance technologies.\\nThese could include government IDs, face or voice recognition, or so-called \"age inference\", which analyses online behaviour and interactions to estimate a person\\'s age.\\nPlatforms cannot rely on users self-certifying or parents vouching for their children.\\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, began closing teen accounts from 4 December last year. It said anyone mistakenly kicked off could use government ID or provide a video selfie to prove their age.\\nMeta said it blocked approximately 550,000 accounts during the first days of the ban.\\nSnapchat said users could use bank accounts, photo ID or selfies for verification.\\nInitially, there were fears that age assurance technologies may wrongly block adults while failing to spot underage users.\\nThe government\\'s own report found that facial assessment technology is least reliable for teenagers.\\nQuestions were also raised about the scale of the potential fines.\\n\"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make A$50 million in revenue,\" former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told the AAP news agency.\\nCritics have also argued that the limited scope of the ban - even if properly implemented - undermined its ability to protect children.\\nDating websites have been excluded, along with gaming platforms and AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.\\nOthers think that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.\\nSome teens told the BBC they had set up fake profiles ahead of the deadline - although the government warned social media companies to identify and remove such accounts.

But that initial rise has since dropped.\\nThe number of Australians downloading virtual private networks – or VPNs – also increased before the ban, but has since fallen back to normal levels.\\nVPN technology allows users to hide their location and pretend they are based in another country, in effect, bypassing local laws.\\nTeenagers the BBC spoke to a month into the ban had mixed feelings about it.

She released a statement on Thursday to mark the national day of mourning, saying \"my responsibility as leader of the opposition and leader of the Liberal party is to Australians in mourning\".\\nThough both parties in the Coalition voted against legislation tightening gun controls, the Liberals had sided with the Labor government on Tuesday to pass hate speech reforms introduced after the Bondi Beach attack.\\nBut their Nationals colleagues abstained from the vote in the lower house and voted against the measure in the senate, despite a shadow cabinet agreement, citing concerns that the legislation had been rushed and posed a threat to free speech.\\nThe laws includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence.\\nOn Wednesday three Nationals frontbenchers offered their resignations, which Ley accepted despite a warning from Littleproud that if she accepted them the rest of the Nationals front bench would follow. The rest of the shadow cabinet duly resigned.\\n\"This process was wasn\\'t all Sussan Ley\\'s fault,\" Littleproud said. \"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese put her in this process.

The gun reform measures include a national gun buyback scheme and new checks on firearm licence applications.\\nHome Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the Bondi gunmen would not legally have had access to firearms if such a law had been in place prior to the attack, the country\\'s worst mass shooting in decades.\\nGoverning Labor senators were backed on the anti-hate bill by Liberal lawmakers, whose coalition partners abstained.\\nAfter last month\\'s mass shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came under huge pressure for not having done enough to prevent the attack in the first place, amid growing fears of antisemitism in the Jewish community.\\nPoliticians were recalled two weeks early to debate the legislation. Introducing the reforms, Burke said individuals with \"hate in their hearts and guns in their hands\" had carried out the 14 December attack.\\nThe father in the father-son duo allegedly behind the attack legally owned six firearms, while his son had been on the radar of intelligence agencies.\\nThe gun reform bill, which cleared the House of Representatives by 96 votes to 45, includes stricter firearm import controls and provisions to improve information sharing between intelligence agencies on people trying to obtain gun licences.\\nThe buyback scheme will target \"surplus and newly restricted firearms\", Burke said, reducing the country\\'s four million registered guns.\\nBurke added that it \"comes as a shock to most Australians\" to know that the country has more firearms that it did before the 1996 Port Arthur attack, in which a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania.\\nThat attack, the country\\'s worst mass shooting, had prompted the then government to introduce some of the world\\'s strictest gun controls. The new law will bring in some of the most significant changes to Australia\\'s guns laws since then.\\nThe hate speech reforms had originally been included in an omnibus bill with the gun reforms but the government split the legislation last week after both the Liberal-National opposition coalition and the Greens said they would vote against.\\nWhile the Labor government has a comfortable majority in the lower house, it needs the support of other parties in the Senate.\\nCoalition MPs cited concerns about free speech and said the legislation was not clearly defined, among other things, while the Greens said they could not support it unless changes were made to protect all minorities and legitimate protest.\\nBut on Tuesday, Liberals leader Sussan Ley, who last week said the bill was \"unsalvageable\", said her party had reached agreement with the government on a watered-down version.\\nThe Liberals had \"stepped up to fix legislation\" that the government had \"mishandled\", she said in a statement, adding that the bill had been \"narrowed, strengthened and properly focused on keeping Australians safe\".\\nThe bill includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence. It will be subject to a review every two years by a parliamentary joint committee. The opposition will also be consulted on the listing and delisting of extremist organisations.\\nThe bill was passed by the lower house and late in the evening it cleared the Senate - by 38 votes to 22 - after the National Party abstained while their Liberal coalition partners voted in favour. The Greens voted against, saying it would have a \"chilling effect\" on political debate and protest.\\n'},\n",

He has been released from hospital.\\nIt follows three other attacks in Sydney over the past two days. All beaches in Sydney\\'s northern area will remain closed until further notice, said police.\\nThe attacks follow days of heavy rains, which NSW Superintendent Joseph McNulty had earlier said may have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for shark attacks. Rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.\\nThe attack on Tuesday took place near the Point Plomer campground, about 450km (279 miles) north of Sydney.\\nSteve Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the surfer was \"very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries\", ABC reported.\\n\"We really strongly advocate that nobody swim or surf near river mouths because it\\'s obviously an area where sharks congregate,\" Pearce said. \"If it\\'s dirty water I\\'d think twice about going in there.\"\\nA young surfer had a similarly lucky escape at Dee Why Beach in Sydney on Monday, but a shark attack at nearby Manly hours later left a 27-year-old with \"life-changing\" injuries.

They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.\\nLast November, a woman was killed and a man was seriously injured after being attacked by a bull shark on a remote beach, also on the NSW Mid North coast.\\nBull sharks are typically seen around Sydney in January and February - the summer months in Australia - as the \"water is at their preferred temperature\", Dr Daryl McPhee, associate professor of environmental science at Bond University, told the BBC.\\nThough Australia is a global shark attack hotspot, the chances of being attacked are still minute - making this string of shark attacks in NSW a rare phenomenon.\\n\"This series of bites from bull sharks in such a short period of time is highly unusual,\" said McPhee.\\nPolice on Monday advised the public to avoid waterways in NSW due to recent weather, which has decreased water quality and visibility.\\n\"I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time,\" Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters.\\nRain can concentrate fish that bull sharks prey on downstream in rivers and beaches, McPhee said, adding that \"bull sharks are well adapted to feeding in murky water after rain\".\\n\"Where you find the fish, you find the bull sharks.

Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.\\n\"The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave.

       "  'Article': 'One of Australia\\'s biggest cultural festivals has been left in disarray after a decision to disinvite a prominent Australian-Palestinian writer, triggering a massive backlash, a mass exodus from fellow authors – and the ultimate cancellation of the festival\\'s Writers\\' Week.\\nThe board of the Adelaide Festival last week said Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, a vocal critic of Israel, had been removed from its Writers\\' Week lineup due to \"sensitivities\" after the shooting of 15 people – by gunmen allegedly inspired by the Islamic State militant group – at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach in December.\\nThough the Adelaide Festival\\'s board said they \"do not suggest in any way\" that Abdel-Fattah had \"any connection with the tragedy at Bondi\", they made the decision that it would not be \"culturally sensitive\" to include her \"given her past statements\".\\nShe called the decision to exclude her a \"blatant and shameless act of anti-Palestinian racism and censorship\" and the attempt to link her with the Bondi attack \"despicable\".\\nIn the following days, dozens of other writers scheduled to appear withdrew from the festival, which also features music, dance, theatre and other cultural events.\\nBy Tuesday the list had jumped to 180, including former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, British author Zadie Smith, beloved Australian writer Helen Garner and British-Australian novelist Kathy Lette.\\nOver the weekend, four members of the eight-member board, including the chair, resigned without detailing their reasons. And on Tuesday the director of the Writers\\' Week - who had invited Abdel-Fattah - stood down too.\\nLouise Adler, the Jewish daughter of Holocaust survivors, said art had increasingly come under attack since the start of the Israel-Gaza war and that she could not \"be party to silencing writers\".\\n\"Writers and writing matters, even when they are presenting ideas that discomfort and challenge us,\" she wrote in the Guardian Australia.\\nHours later, the board put out a fresh statement, apologising to Abdel-Fattah for \"how the decision was represented\" and announcing that the Writers\\' Week could \"no longer go ahead\".\\n\"We recognise and deeply regret the distress this decision has caused,\" it wrote.\\nAll remaining members of the Adelaide Festival board would step down bar one, it said, a move it hoped could \"secure the success\" of the festival this year \"and beyond\".\\nThe saga has now left the festival board-less just weeks out from its start late next month, has threatened to spark legal action, and has reignited discussions in Australia about freedom of expression.\\nAbdel-Fattah, a novelist, lawyer and academic, had been invited to the festival to discuss her latest novel Discipline – which she describes as \"a cautionary tale about the cost of silence and cowardice\".\\nShe has previously been criticised for statements arguing that Zionists had \"no claim or right to cultural safety\" and a 2024 post on X in which she said \"the goal is decolonisation and the end of this murderous Zionist colony\", a reference to Israel.\\nControversies around her also include an image posted to her social media in the hours after the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, depicting a person parachuting with a Palestinian flag. Hamas fighters used paragliders to cross the high-tech security fence into Israel at the start of the attack, landing in civilian areas where many residents died.\\nAbout 1,200 people were killed in the attack. It triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza, which has killed more than 71,419 people since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\\nAbdel-Fattah confirmed to Australian broadcaster ABC that she had posted the image, but said she had done so before the true extent of the attacks was known.\\n\"At that point, I had no idea about the death toll, I had no idea about what was happening on the ground... Of course, I do not support the killing of civilians,\" she told the ABC.\\nThe academic has been the target of public campaigns before. Opposition politicians and some prominent Jewish Australians called for research funding awarded to Abdel-Fattah to be cancelled in 2024. After a letter from Education Minister Jason Clare, the funding was suspended while Abdel-Fattah was investigated over allegations she had bent the grant\\'s rules, though she was ultimately cleared last month.\\nNorman Schueler, of the Jewish Community Council for South Australia, last week said his organisation had sent a letter to the Adelaide Festival board lobbying for Abdel-Fattah\\'s removal.\\n\"It was a very wise move and it will improve the cohesiveness of the festival by not having her there,\" he told the Adelaide Advertiser after her removal. Upon news of the growing walkout, he added: \"I think for everyone who has dropped out that it\\'s rather pathetic because that means they agree with what Dr Fattah is on about... Namely, that Israel should not exist.\"\\nSouth Australian Premier Peter Malinauskus - whose government is a key backer of the festival - said that he \"wholeheartedly\" supported Abdel-Fattah\\'s exclusion and had \"absolutely made clear to the board that I did not think it was wise\" to invite her.\\nHowever, Malinauskus denied having played any role in the board\\'s decision, telling the ABC on Monday that, though he shared his opinion, he had not threatened to withdraw funding or sack anyone. He also denied that his position was influenced by Jewish lobby groups.\\nAdler said the board\\'s decision had been taken \"despite my strongest opposition\" and added: \"In my view, boards composed of individuals with little experience in the arts, and blind to the moral implications of abandoning the principle of freedom of expression, have been unnerved by the pressure exerted by politicians calculating their electoral prospects and relentless, coordinated letter-writing campaigns.\"\\n\"The board\\'s statement cites community cohesion, an oft-referenced anxiety which should be treated with scepticism,\" she said. \"One doesn\\'t have to be a student of history to know that art in the service of \\'social cohesion\\' is propaganda.\"\\nAfter her appearance was cancelled, Abdel-Fattah said Australian arts and cultural institutions had displayed \"utter contempt and inhumanity towards Palestinians\".\\n\"The only Palestinians they will tolerate are silent and invisible ones.\"\\nIt isn\\'t the first time Abdel-Fattah has been at the centre of the derailment of a writers\\' festival.\\nTwo days before it was due to begin in August last year, Bendigo Writers Festival issued a code of conduct requiring speakers to \"avoid language or topics that could be considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful\".\\nA subsequent walkout - led by Abdel-Fattah and others over concerns it could prevent free discussion of the Israel-Gaza war - led to the cancellation of around a third of the programme.\\nHowever Abdel-Fattah has been accused of double standards, by sections of the media and Malinauskus, who claim that she had successfully demanded the exclusion of New York Times journalist Thomas Friedman from the Adelaide festival two years ago.\\nA letter sent by her and nine other academics to the board followed his publication of a column in which he compared players in the Middle East to members of the animal kingdom, including caterpillars, wasps and spiders.\\n\"Call it what you like, after the correspondence from Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, they removed a pro-Jewish Israeli speaker. Fast forward two years and I think it\\'s reasonable for the board to apply the same principle,\" Malinauskus said.\\nAbdel-Fattah rejected the allegations of hypocrisy, saying in a statement to the BBC that Friedman\\'s article had \"compared various Arab and Muslim nations and groups to insects and vermin requiring eradication at a time when talk of \\'human animals\\' was being used to justify wholesale slaughter in Gaza\".\\n\"In contrast, I was cancelled because my presence and identity as a Palestinian was deemed \\'culturally insensitive\\' and linked to the Bondi atrocity,\" her statement continued.\\nShe also denied that Friedman had been removed at her behest. In a letter dated February 2024 and quoted by Australian media, the board wrote that cancelling a writer was an \"extremely serious request\" and that while Friedman had been scheduled to attend he would no longer take part due to \"last-minute scheduling issues\".\\n\"If he was in fact quietly cancelled, it only underscores the racism of cancelling me in such a brazen and publicly humiliating manner,\" Abdel-Fattah said.\\nThe BBC has contacted Friedman for comment.\\nAdler said at least 180 writers had withdrawn from the festival, devastating its programme. Some said that while they did not necessarily agree with Abdel-Fattah, they defended her right to free speech.\\nAustralian journalist Peter Greste, who was jailed in Egypt a decade ago in what human rights groups called a sham case, in an opinion piece for the Guardian Australia wrote that her exclusion meant \"we are undermining our capacity to hold those difficult conversations\" and \"doing the work\" of extremists for them.\\nKathy Lette in an Instagram post argued that audiences should be trusted to \"make up their minds about all speakers – me included. As authoritarianism rears its hideous head around the world, we need to defend these havens of free speech.\"\\nHowever, former Australian foreign minister Bob Carr, who has strongly criticised Israel\\'s assault on Gaza, said he supported Abdel-Fattah\\'s exclusion. He told the Guardian Australia he believed some of her previous statements had been counterproductive to the Palestinian cause and that given the circumstances after the Bondi attack the decision was not unreasonable.\\n\"The Adelaide writers\\' festival has supported hearing Palestinian voices, its record on this is unimpeachable,\" Carr said.\\nHe was one of the only festival speakers to publicly back the board.\\nFormer Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis posted a video on X in which he tore up his \"precious\" and \"coveted\" invitation to speak, claiming the festival had been \"destroyed\" by the \"Zionist lobby\".\\nAward-winning First Nations poet Dr Evelyn Araluen said she was \"so disappointed to witness yet another absurd and irrational capitulation to the demands of a genocidal foreign state from the Australian arts sector\".\\n\"Erasing Palestinians from public life in Australia won\\'t prevent antisemitism,\" she added.\\nABC journalist and presenter Sarah Ferguson, who had been due to host conversations with Tina Brown and Jacinda Ardern – both now cancelled – said the festival had \"created a place where debate flourished… including on our most difficult subjects\" and that it \"should be defended in our cultural life\".\\nIn its latest statement, the board said: \"This is not about identity or dissent but rather a continuing rapid shift in the national discourse around the breadth of freedom of expression in our nation following Australia\\'s worst terror attack in history.\"\\nThe focus would now turn to re-assembling the board, the statement said, and \"ensuring a successful Adelaide Festival... which safeguards the long and rich cultural legacy of our state.\"\\nIt added that it is \"committed to rebuilding trust with our artistic community\".\\nAbdel-Fattah has rejected the board\\'s apology as \"disingenuous\". \"It is clear that the board\\'s regret extends to how the message of my cancellation was conveyed, not the decision itself,\" she wrote in a post on Instagram.\\n\"The Bondi shooting does not mean I or anyone else has to stop advocating for an end to the illegal occupation and systematic extermination of my people - that is an obscene and absurd demand,\" she added.\\nHer lawyer has sent a letter to the board demanding to know which of her past statements were used to justify the decision to uninvite her, and has told the BBC the writer is yet to decide whether to take any legal action.\\nSigning off her statement on Tuesday, Abdel-Fattah said she was \"exhausted\". \"Please remember that the genocide of Palestinians continues and that all of this is a smokescreen. I am not the story. Palestine is.\"\\n'},\n",

I was angry because people thought I was sidelined based on injuries, when in reality, it was internal homophobia that kept me on the bench.\"\\nA change in management meant \"politics\" kept him off the pitch and limited his career opportunities, Cavallo said, also alleging a photo of him and his partner was mocked by his teammates in a group chat.\\n\"For the first time, I actually questioned if I should have kept my sexuality a secret.\"\\nA spokesperson for Adelaide United - which is due to take part in its fourth Pride Cup match on Saturday - said it was \"extremely disappointed by the claims made\".\\n\"Adelaide United has always been committed to fostering an inclusive environment for players, staff and supporters, and we remain proud of our ongoing work to promote inclusion across football.\"\\nCavallo has previously spoken about receiving death threats on a near daily basis after his decision to publicly come out, but has said that his only regret is not coming out sooner.\\nWhile former professional footballers or those in lower tiers have come out as gay before, Cavallo was the first to do so while actively playing in a premier league.\\nHis 2021 revelation inspired Jake Daniels, who in 2022, at the age of 17, became the first British professional male footballer to come out in more than 30 years.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'About 550,000 accounts were blocked by Meta during the first days of Australia\\'s landmark social media ban for kids.\\nIn December, a new law began requiring that the world\\'s most popular social media sites - including Instagram and Facebook - stop Australians aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms.\\nThe ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms.\\nCompanies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online. However they continue to argue for other measures, with some experts raising similar concerns.\\n\"We call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans,\" Meta said in a blog update.\\nThe company said it blocked 330,639 accounts on Instagram, 173,497 on Facebook, and 39,916 on Threads during its first week of compliance with the new law.\\nThey again put the argument that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.\\n\"This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law.\"\\nVarious governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children\\'s use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world\\'s strictest.\\nThe policy is wildly popular with parents and envied by world leader, with the Tories this week pledging to follow suit if they win power at the next election, due before 2029.\\nHowever some experts have raised concerns that Australian kids can circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that\\'s performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.\\nAnd backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.\\n'},\n",

Residents in more than a dozen communities have been advised to leave their homes.\\nAuthorities fear the fires, which are being fuelled by very hot, dry and windy conditions, could burn for several weeks.\\nVictoria\\'s Premier Jacinta Allan said 30 active fires were burning across the state, 10 of which were of particular concern.\\nShe said 350,000 hectares had been burnt across the state as of 08:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT on Saturday).\\n\"We will see fires continue for some time across the state and that is why we are not through the worst of this by a long way,\" she told Australian media.\\n\"There are fires that are continuing right now that are threatening homes and property.\"\\nHuman remains were found in the village of Gobur, near the town of Longwood, some 110km (70 sq miles) north of the state capital Melbourne, police said.

Hundreds more are believed to have died due to the effects of the smoke which choked towns and cities that summer.\\nOne of the worst-affected places is the small town of Harcourt in the central highlands of Victoria, where firefighter Tyrone Rice lost his own home in the blaze.

       "  'Article': 'For the first time in years, Amy feels free.\\nOne month since Australia\\'s teen social media ban kicked in, she says she is \"disconnected from my phone\" and her daily routine has changed.\\nThe 14-year-old first felt the pangs of online addiction in the days after the ban started.\\n\"I knew that I was still unable to access Snapchat - however, from instinct, I still reached to open the app in the morning,\" she wrote on day two of the ban in a diary she kept for the first week afterwards.\\nBy day four of the ban – when ten platforms including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok went dark for thousands of Australian children aged 16 and under – she had started to question the magnetic pull of Snapchat.\\n\"While it\\'s sad that I can\\'t snap my friends, I can still text them on other platforms and I honestly feel kind of free knowing that I don\\'t have to worry about doing my streaks anymore,\" Amy wrote.\\nStreaks - a Snapchat feature considered by some as highly addictive – require two people to send a \"snap\" – a photo or video – to each other every day in order to maintain their \"streak\" which can last for days, months, even years.\\nBy day six, the allure of Snapchat - which she first downloaded when she was 12 and checked several times a day - was fading fast for Amy.\\n\"I often used to call my friends on Snapchat after school, but because I am no longer able to, I went for a run,\" she wrote.\\nFast forward a month, and her habits are markedly different.\\n\"Previously, it was part of my routine to open Snapchat,\" the Sydney teen tells the BBC.\\n\"Opening Snapchat would often lead to Instagram and then TikTok, which sometimes resulted in me losing track of time after being swept up by the algorithm ... I now reach for my phone less and mainly use it when I genuinely need to do something.\"\\nAmy\\'s experience is likely to put a smile on the face of Australia\\'s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who in the lead-up to the ban pleaded with kids to kick their social media habits.\\nThe government has cited online bullying and protecting young people from online predators and harmful content as some of the reasons for the ban.\\nSince 10 December, tech companies risk being fined up to A$49.5m (US$32m, £25m) if they don\\'t take \"reasonable steps\" to boot under-16s off their platforms.\\nBut Albanese\\'s hopes that the ban would usher in a new generation of sports-loving, book-reading, instrument-playing kids may have fallen flat for many.\\nAahil, 13, hasn\\'t read more books, played more sports or started learning an instrument.\\nInstead, he spends about two and a half hours on various social media platforms every day – the same as before the ban started.\\nHe still has his YouTube and Snapchat accounts – both use fake birthdays - and spends most of his time on gaming platform Roblox and Discord, a messaging platform popular with gamers – neither of which are banned.\\n\"It hasn\\'t really changed anything,\" Aahil says, as most of his friends still have active social media accounts.\\nBut his mum Mau has noticed a change.\\n\"He\\'s moodier,\" she says, adding he spends more time playing video games than before.\\n\"When he was on social media, he was more social … more talkative with us,\" Mau says, though, she adds, his moodiness may also simply be the \"teenage years\".\\nConsumer psychologist Christina Anthony says moods might be due to the ban\\'s short-term effects on emotion regulation.\\n\"For many teenagers, social media isn\\'t just entertainment - it\\'s a tool for managing boredom, stress, and social anxiety, and for seeking reassurance or connection,\" she says.\\n\"When access is disrupted, some young people may initially experience irritability, restlessness, or a sense of social disconnection… not because the platform itself is essential, but because a familiar coping mechanism has been removed.\"\\nOver time, young people may adopt new coping strategies such as talking to trusted adults, she adds.\\nIn another Sydney household, the ban has had little impact.\\n\"My usage of social media is the same as prior to the ban because I made new accounts for both TikTok and Instagram with ages above 16 years old,\" says 15-year-old Lulu.\\nThe new law has influenced her in other ways.\\n\"I am reading a bit more because I don\\'t want to be on social media as much.\"\\nBut she\\'s not spending more times outdoors, nor is she arranging to meet friends face-to-face.\\nInstead, Lulu, along with Amy and Aahil, all started using WhatsApp and Facebook\\'s Messenger more – neither are banned - because they couldn\\'t contact friends who had lost access to their social media accounts.\\nThis, Anthony says, goes to the heart of why social media is fun and engaging in the first place: it\\'s social.\\n\"The enjoyment doesn\\'t come from scrolling alone, but from shared attention,\" she says, \"knowing that friends are seeing the same posts, reacting to them, and participating in the same conversations.\"\\nWhen that \"emotional lift\" fades, the platform begins to feel \"oddly unsocial\".\\n\"That\\'s why some young people disengage even if they technically still have access…without peers present, both the social feedback and the mood payoff drop sharply.\"\\nSeeking lookalike apps to fill the void was exactly what thousands of Australians did in the days before the ban started, with three little-known apps - Lemon8, Yope and Coverstar - surging in downloads.\\nThis attraction to alternative photo and video-sharing platforms fits into what\\'s known as compensatory behaviour, Anthony says.\\n\"When a familiar and emotionally rewarding activity is restricted, people don\\'t simply stop seeking that reward… they look for alternative ways to get it,\" she says.\\n\"For teens, that often means compensating with platforms or activities that provide similar psychological benefits: social connection, identity expression, entertainment, or escapism.\"\\nThat initial rise has now dropped but daily downloads are still higher than usual, says Adam Blacker from Apptopia, a US-based company which tracks consumer trends of mobile apps.\\nThe fall in downloads suggested \"a chunk of kids might be embracing the new rules and swapping their time spent on mobile for time spent elsewhere,\" Blacker says.\\nAmy was one of the thousands who downloaded Lemon8 - created by the makers behind TikTok - before the ban.\\n\"This was largely influenced by social pressure and a fear of missing out as many people around me were doing the same,\" she says.\\nBut she has never used it.\\n\"Since then, my interest in social media has decreased significantly, and I don\\'t feel any need to download or use alternative platforms.\"\\nThe number of Australians downloading virtual private networks – or VPNs – also increased before the ban, but has since fallen back to normal levels.\\nVPN technology allows users to hide their location and pretend they are based in another country, in effect, bypassing local laws.\\nBut they have limited appeal to teens, Blacker says, because many social media platforms can detect VPNs.\\n\"Teens can only leverage VPNs to create a new account,\" he says, so \"they would be starting over in terms of connections, settings, photos and more\".\\nIn the months before the ban, debate swirled around the exclusion of gaming platforms, with critics concerned that many youngsters use them in the same way as social media, meaning they presented the same types of potential harms.\\nWhile there\\'s no evidence yet on whether more teenagers have switched to the likes of Roblox, Discord and Minecraft to socialise, it\\'s a real possibility, says Mark Johnson, an expert in gaming live stream platforms such as Twitch, which is part of the ban.\\n\"But that\\'s also contingent on a young person having the required hardware, the required cultural and technical knowledge, and so forth - games are much harder to get into, for the uninitiated, than social media sites,\" he says.\\nJohnson, who lectures in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, says the reaction to the ban has been mixed.\\n\"A lot of parents seem to be reassured and pleased that their children and teenagers are spending far less time in social media,\" he says.\\n\"Equally, some are lamenting the newfound difficulty their young people are having in communicating with their friends, and in some cases with family members who live elsewhere.\"\\nA spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner says they will release their findings on how the ban is going - including the number of accounts that have been deactivated since 10 December - in the coming weeks.\\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for the Communications Minister Anika Wells says the ban is \"making a real difference\" and leaders across the globe are looking to mirror the Australian model.\\n\"Delaying access to social media is giving young Australians three more years to build their community and identity offline, starting with spending more time with family and friends over the summer holidays,\" the spokesperson says.\\nFor Amy, one of the unforeseen benefits came in the hours after the Bondi Beach shootings on 14 December when two gunmen killed 15 people and injured dozens at an event marking the Jewish celebration Hanukkah.\\n\"After the Bondi Beach incident, I was glad that I had not spent too long on TikTok, as I would have likely been exposed to an overwhelming amount of negative information and potentially disturbing content,\" she wrote on 15 December.\\nShe says her time spent on social media has halved since the ban and while TikTok and Instagram are still fun, not having Snapchat has been a gamechanger.\\n\"Snapchat gives me the most notifications so that\\'s usually what gets me on my phone and then everything happens after that,\" she says.\\nFor Amy\\'s mum Yuko, she\\'s noticed her daughter seems content spending more time by herself.\\n\"We\\'re not entirely sure whether this shift is directly because of the ban or simply part of having a quieter holiday period,\" she says, with most Australian students on school holidays until the end of January.\\n\"It\\'s hard to say yet whether [the ban] will be a positive or negative change - only time will tell.\"\\n'},\n",

It can also offer legal protections to whistleblowers.\\nThe commission will examine four key areas, Albanese said. They comprise:\\ninvestigating the \"nature and prevalence of antisemitism\" and its \"key drivers\" in Australia\\nmaking recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism\\nexamining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attack\\nmaking any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremism\\nThe prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April.\\nFormer High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that \"this won\\'t be a drawn-out process.\" Previous royal commissions have taken years.\\n\"This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,\" Albanese said.\\nRumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community.\\nFormer treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese\\'s announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were \"serious concerns\" about her appointment, without specifying what they were.\\nSpeaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was \"an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision\".\\nAddressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: \"It\\'s one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she\\'s the most qualified person we could possibly consider.\"\\nHe also added that the inquiry was not meant to \"provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East\".\\n\"The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they\\'re opposed to, that have nothing to do with them,\" Albanese said.\\nIn the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme.\\nAlbanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\".\\nHe previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report.\\nHer report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism.\\nSpeaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government\\'s decision was \"the right one and an important one\".\\n\"It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy,\" she said.\\n'},\n",

Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel\\'s occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.\\nIn the aftermath of the Bondi attacks, in which 15 people were killed, the Jewish community accused the government of not doing enough to protect it from rising antisemitism.\\nThe new protest laws will also allow police to restrict demonstrations at places of worship, with stronger penalties for breaches.\\nTimothy Roberts, president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, said the new law ignores a recent decision by the state\\'s supreme court which found the so-called \"move-on power\" at religious locations went against Australia\\'s implied constitutional freedom of political communication.\\nReligious institutions exercise significant and overt political power in Australian politics and this makes them a legitimate site of protest in a democratic society, Mr Roberts said.\\n\"The laws introduced today are an affront to our right to assemble and communicate with each other,\" he said, adding they \"damage our democracy\".\\nHe said Minns wants social cohesion but he does not know the meaning of the term.\\n\"He thinks silence is peace, and does not seem to realise it can also reflect oppression.

Elsewhere across the country, there are no limits.\\nOne of the gunmen in the Bondi shooting, Sajid Akram, had six registered firearms.\\nOther gun law changes include more regular renewals for gun licence holders from every five years to every two years, and a review of the types of firearms available to most gun owners.\\nMark Banasiak from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party - which lobbies for more relaxed gun laws - said the state\\'s 260,000 gun licence holders were being \"punished\" and \"made a scapegoat for agency failings\".\\n\"We\\'re diverting away from what the real problem is,\" he said, referring to \"a climate of hate and division that\\'s been allowed to fester for two and a half years because government haven\\'t done enough to stop that.\"\\nWalter Mikac, whose wife and two young daughters were among the 35 people shot dead in Tasmania by a lone gunman in 1996 in what is Australia\\'s deadliest mass shooting, welcomed the reforms.\\nThe changes will \"close critical gaps in our gun laws\" and put community safety first, he said.\\nThe government also aims to crackdown on hate speech and symbols, as well as enabling police to ban protests for up to three months after a terrorist attack.\\nPalestine Action Group spokesperson Josh Lees said the new laws were \"incredibly draconian\".\\n\"Australia is seen as a safe country,\" he said, \"where freedom of speech is very important\" but the Bondi shooting was \"perhaps changing the dynamics of that democracy and that freedom\".\\nDavid Ossip, president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said moves to ban \"intifada\" chants was a \"watershed moment\" in confronting hate and incitement.\\nHe also welcomed greater police powers during protests.\\n\"The right to protest is a core Australian value and a fundamental tenet of a democratic society,\" he said.\\n\"But it has never included the right to hide your face and shout slogans calling for violence against one\\'s fellow Australians or waving the flags of groups devoted to murder and destruction.\"\\nAdditional reporting by Katy Watson\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Australia\\'s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a review into the police and national intelligence agencies after the Bondi Beach attack in Sydney.\\n\"The ISIS-inspired atrocity last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation,\" Albanese said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. \"Our security agencies must be in the best position to respond.\"\\nThe shooting, in which 15 people were killed after two gunmen opened fire at a Jewish festival, has been declared a terrorist incident. Police say the attackers were inspired by \"Islamic State ideology\".\\nA national day of reflection is being held on Sunday.\\nA minute\\'s silence was observed at 18:47 (07:47 GMT) - the time when the attack began.\\nAlbanese looked startled as he arrived at the event in Sydney as he was met with a loud chorus of boos and jeers.\\nAt least one member of the crowd shouted \"blood on your hands\" while another was tackled by police after moving towards the prime minister.\\nAlbanese was steered towards a VIP seating area and his wife Jodie Haydon grasped his arm in support.\\nThe Jewish community in Australia has repeatedly said this attack was a shock, not a surprise. The overwhelming view is that more could and should have been done to prevent it from happening.\\nThey have accused Albanese of siding with the Palestinians over supporting Israel and the relationship worsened when he moved to recognise the state of Palestine earlier this year.\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Albanese - as well as the leaders of other countries that have recognised a Palestinian state - of rewarding Hamas, the group responsible for the deadliest attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.\\nAfter the Bondi Beach attack last Sunday, Netanyahu said Albanese\\'s government \"did nothing to stop the spread of antisemitism in Australia\".\\nThe Australian prime minister denies the accusation.\\nThe prime minister earlier said the intelligence review, due by April 2026, would focus on ensuring authorities were equipped to tackle extremism.\\nHe said: \"The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet will examine whether federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the right powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe in the wake of the horrific antisemitic Bondi Beach terrorist attack.\"\\nIn the wake of Australia\\'s deadliest mass shooting in almost three decades, the government has also announced plans to tighten gun controls, while the New South Wales premier is pushing to crack down on hate speech.\\nSuspected gunman Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.\\nEarlier on Sunday, Governor-General Samantha Mostyn addressed a vigil held in Bondi, hosted by the National Council of Jewish Women Australia, where attendees largely wore white to symbolise peace.\\n\"The entire Jewish community, whether it\\'s here in Bondi or across our nation, you are part of the belonging story and the success of this country,\" she said.\\nAustralians across the country are still reeling and there\\'s a sense of shock and disbelief that something like this could have happened.\\nBut this weekend, normality returned in some ways. Bondi promenade was once again filled with surfers, runners and dog-walkers returning to their regular routine.\\nWhile a sombre mood lingers, children\\'s surf club activities - known locally as \"nippers\" - resumed on Sunday as a sign of the community showing resilience.\\nNorth Bondi\\'s Surf Life Saving president Steve Larnach told the BBC they had considered cancelling the regular nippers events.\\n\"We were also aware of the sensitivity towards our Jewish community,\" Larnach said.\\n\"We did ask their opinion, they were very supportive of us going ahead but also extremely grateful for what we did.\"\\nLifeguard volunteers were among the first on the scene at the shooting last week providing first aid, Larnach added.\\nSome surf lifesavers have been hailed as heroes, including one who was photographed sprinting from a neighbouring beach with a red first aid kit slung over his shoulder.\\nGeraldine Nordfeldt, who brought her daughter to nippers, said \"it was really important to return to whatever this new normal is as soon as we could\".\\n\"You have to return, you can\\'t stay away, you can\\'t let fear win. The beach is the Australian way of life and we all love it,\" she told the BBC.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'It was a Sunday afternoon in April 1996 when a lone gunman armed with semi-automatic rifles killed 35 people in the Australian tourist town of Port Arthur.\\nThe massacre almost 30 years ago, which ushered in some of the strictest gun laws in the world, feels like a bygone age for many Australians.\\nBut the Bondi Beach attack on Sunday, which left 15 dead, rekindled memories of the Tasmanian tragedy - none more so than for leading gun control advocate Roland Browne.\\nAs the country\\'s deadliest modern-day mass shooting was unfolding an hour\\'s drive away, Mr Browne was meeting fellow gun control advocates at his home, ahead of a government meeting, to lobby for a ban on the exact type of firearm the Port Arthur gunman was using.\\nMr Browne, 66, was again at home in Hobart on Sunday when he received news of the shooting at Bondi, targeting a Jewish event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.\\n\"There\\'s just a lot of similarities,\" Mr Browne, who spent childhood summers in Bondi and still has family there, told the BBC.\\n\"They\\'re both very public places frequented by tourists from around the nation and around the world.\"\\n\"It\\'s sickening and I\\'m bitterly disappointed in our political system whereby the voices for tighter gun laws and public health aren\\'t listened to until there\\'s a major event like this,\" he added.\\nFor decades, Australia has stood as a beacon on the world stage for its strict gun laws, he says, taking a similar path to the UK which experienced its own mass shooting in Dunblane, just one month before Port Arthur.\\nEven now, Mr Browne remains friends with relatives of some of the 17 victims - mostly children aged five and six - killed at a primary school in Scotland.\\nBut despite being praised for its stringent gun laws, the reality in Australia is not clear-cut.\\nA report by the Australia Institute earlier this year revealed that there are more than four million privately-owned firearms across the country - almost double the number from about 20 years ago.\\nThat equates to one gun for every seven Australians, the report says.\\nQueensland has the most registered guns, followed by New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria while Tasmania and the Northern Territory have the most guns per person.\\nThe report also dispels a common view that guns are mainly owned by rural residents.\\nGuns are widespread in metropolitan and suburban areas, with one in three firearms in NSW located in major cities, the report said.\\nThe total figure has risen at a lower rate than population increases, but there are now more guns in fewer hands, with every licence holder owning an average of more than four firearms.\\nAnd that\\'s one of the key issues that Mr Browne wants the government to address.\\nCurrently, only one jurisdiction - Western Australia - has a cap on the number of legal firearms that a licence holder can have. Under new laws introduced in March this year, gun owners can have between five and ten firearms, depending on the type of licence and model of firearm.\\nAuthorities have confirmed that one of the alleged gunmen, Sajid Akram who was killed at the scene of the Bondi attack, owned six registered guns.\\nMr Browne wants a cap of one to three guns, depending on the licence category, to be introduced across Australia.\\nBut Tom Kenyon, chief executive of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, argues that a cap would be meaningless.\\n\"Limiting the number of guns wouldn\\'t have made a difference on Sunday,\" he says.\\n\"And it wouldn\\'t have changed the fact that an attack occurred because those two individuals had been radicalised.\"\\nMr Kenyon argues that people intent on harm, without access to guns, will use other weapons, referencing the 2016 Bastille Day massacre in the French city of Nice where 86 people were killed after a man drove a truck into crowds during fireworks celebrations. The attack was claimed by Islamic State (IS).\\nThe other alleged Bondi gunman, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was previously investigated over links to IS, according to comments made by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\\nMr Kenyon also says that more guns are found in cities because most people in Australia live in metropolitan areas and travel to other areas to hunt.\\nGun control laws in Australia are not uniform across the country, with inconsistent implementation of the rules across states and territories.\\nBut generally, to apply for a gun licence, you must be over 18, a \"fit and proper person\", pass a training and safety course and give a \"genuine reason\" for having a firearm.\\nThe eight accepted reasons include recreational hunting or pest control, target or sport shooting, for work (such as security guards and prison officers), for use in farming or animal welfare and firearms collectors.\\nBut there are loopholes.\\nFor example, anyone under 18 was meant to be barred from owning a firearm under the 1996 gun control reforms, but minors in various jurisdictions can have access to a firearm while under supervision, ranging from age 10 in the Northern Territory to 12 in other states.\\nAnother situation is where a particular type of gun is banned in one state but legal elsewhere.\\nIn the days after the Port Arthur massacre, then-Australian prime minister John Howard galvanised every state and territory to overhaul the country\\'s gun laws.\\nMore than 650,000 firearms were voluntarily handed in to authorities and destroyed, as part of a buyback programme. And background checks and a mandatory cooling-off period for gun sales were introduced. Automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were banned.\\nSimilar gun reforms - a ban on semi-automatic weapons and a buyback scheme - were introduced in New Zealand after a white supremacist killed 51 Muslims at two Christchurch mosques in 2019.\\nPart of Howard\\'s reforms included scrapping self-defence as a reason for owning a firearm - a contrast to gun laws in the United States where personal protection is often the main reason for citizens to own guns.\\nGun ownership in the US is much higher compared to Australia as is gun violence. The country saw 488 mass shootings - defined as where four or more people are killed or injured - last year.\\nRecent polling by the Australia Institute showed that seven out of ten Australians think gun laws should make it harder to access a gun and 64% agreed that current gun laws need to be strengthened.\\nIn the hours after the Bondi shooting, the NSW Premier Chris Minns was unequivocal about the need to tighten the state\\'s gun laws.\\n\"If you\\'re not a farmer, you\\'re not involved in agriculture, why do you need these massive weapons?\" he asked.\\nAnd less than 24 hours after the shooting, Australia\\'s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hosted an emergency meeting where leaders from across the country pledged to tighten gun laws. On Friday he announced a national gun buyback scheme \"to help get guns off our streets\", the first scheme of its size since 1996.\\nOther proposals include:\\nlimiting the number of guns someone can legally own\\nlimiting \"open-ended\" licensing\\nmaking Australian citizenship a condition of owning a firearm\\nimproving intelligence sharing when licence applications are being assessed\\nAlbanese said there should also be regular reviews of licence holders.\\n\"People\\'s circumstances can change,\" he said. \"People can be radicalised over a period of time.\"\\nThe swift action prompted Howard – the architect of the 1996 gun laws – to weigh in.\\nWhile he supported stricter gun laws, Howard said the move was an \"attempted diversion\" from the real cause of the tragedy, which he said was a rise in antisemitism in recent years.\\nMr Kenyon believes the moves to tighten gun laws are a waste of resources.\\n\"All that time and effort and political capital could be spent combating radicalisation of individuals,\" he says.\\nThe only thing that might have prevented Sunday\\'s attack was better intelligence-sharing that would have flagged the gunmen\\'s links to extremist ideology to the NSW firearms\\' registry, he says.\\nElsewhere, one of the headline reforms proposed in 1996 - a national firearms register - is yet to be created, with authorities saying the database is \"expected to be operational by mid-2028\".\\nLittle had been done to implement the measure until the 2022 fatal shooting of two police officers and a civilian in Wieambilla became a catalyst to speed the process up.\\nThe Bondi shooting has now propelled the government to list the creation of the register as a priority.\\nMr Browne believes the application process for a gun licence is too easy and that licences for recreational hunting should be abolished as its definition is ambiguous.\\nSajid Akram owned a recreational hunting licence.\\nBut recreational hunting contributes a \"valuable social good\" to Australia, argues Mr Kenyon, saying that hunters remove millions of feral animals such as rabbits, foxes and cats.\\nHe was just 10 when he picked up his first gun. Now 53, he goes on regular hunting trips - often shooting deer in Victoria\\'s high country - and competes in pistol shooting events six times a year.\\nHunting isn\\'t just a pastime for him, it\\'s about family and community connections. He taught his three children - all adults now - how to shoot when they were teens.\\n\"All my life I\\'ve had the opportunity to do it and I\\'ve enjoyed it,\" Mr Kenyon, a former Labour politician in South Australia, says, \"so I want my kids to have the same opportunity\".\\nIn the wake of the Port Arthur massacre, self-loading firearms were banned, resulting in a drop in gun-related deaths, but the risk to public safety has now shifted to high-powered fast-loading rifles with magazines that can shoot up to five rounds, of the kind believed to have been used by the gunmen.\\n\"If you watch the video, you\\'ll see him firing rapidly with his rifle,\" Mr Browne says, referring to footage of one of the gunmen shooting from a footbridge leading to Bondi Beach.\\n\"If he didn\\'t have a magazine in that rifle, he would have had to manually reload each time,\" which would dramatically reduce - but not eliminate - the threat of a mass shooting.\\nMass shootings remain rare in Australia.\\nIn 2018, a Western Australian grandfather killed his wife, his daughter and four grandchildren before turning the gun on himself in what was, at the time, the worst such incident since Port Arthur.\\nFor Mr Browne, Australia is a safe country but incidents involving firearms are not uncommon, ranging from neighbourhood disputes to gang shootings.\\n\"This is a reflection on guns being in the wrong hands, a legacy of poor storage allowing guns to be stolen and sold - and thus move into black markets.\"\\nBut the issue of gun control isn\\'t just about the physical firearm.\\n\"It\\'s like a plane crash, it\\'s never just one thing. It\\'s a culmination of a lot of factors,\" he says. Australia needs better assessment of whether a licence holder is a suitable candidate and more stringent rules on the types of guns that can be legally owned, he says.\\nIn the aftermath of the Port Arthur massacre, Mr Browne met with many of the survivors and families of the victims including Walter Mikac, whose wife Nanette and two young daughters were among the 35 people killed.\\nMr Mikac, who founded the Alannah and Madeline Foundation charity to honour his children, said the Bondi shooting was a \"horrific reminder\" of ensuring Australia\\'s gun laws protect everyone.\\n\"After Port Arthur, Australia made a collective commitment to put community safety first, and that commitment remains as important today as ever,\" he said in a statement.\\nMr Browne echoed those sentiments.\\nGun laws need to be reformed to \"keep up-to-date with changing community attitudes, technological advances and to rectify identified deficiencies,\" Mr Browne says.\\n\"It\\'s sad that it takes such a tragedy to get people to wake up and listen.\"\\n'},\n",

Others ran. Some didn\\'t make it far.\\nThe 10-odd minutes that followed were the longest of their lives.\\nWayne\\'s body was acting as a human shield for his eldest daughter, but his mind was elsewhere: with his missing child Gigi.\\n\"We had to wait all that time for the gunshots to stop. It felt like eternity,\" he tells the BBC.\\nUnbeknown to him, Jessica\\'s gaze had caught on a little girl in a rainbow skirt, confused, scared and alone - calling out for her mummy and daddy.\\nThe pregnant mother couldn\\'t protect her own child, so in that moment she decided she\\'d protect this one. She smothered Gigi\\'s body with her own, and uttered \"I\\'ve got you\", over and over again. They could feel the moment a woman about a metre away was shot and killed.\\nBy the time the air finally fell silent, Wayne had become all but convinced Gigi was dead.\\n\"I was looking amongst the blood and the bodies,\" he says, growing emotional.\\n\"What I saw - no human should ever see that.\"\\nEventually, he caught a glimpse of a familiar colourful skirt and found his daughter, stained in red - but okay, still shrouded under Jessica.

We\\'ll be indebted to her for the rest of our lives.\"\\nIt is one of the incredible accounts of selflessness and courage that have emerged from one of Australia\\'s darkest days.\\nDeclared a terror attack by police, it is the deadliest in Australian history. Dozens were injured and 15 people - including a 10-year-old girl - were killed by the two gunmen, who police say were inspired by the jihadist group Islamic State (IS).\\nMore people undoubtedly would have been harmed if it weren\\'t for Ahmed al Ahmed.\\nA Syrian-Australian shop owner, he\\'d been having coffee nearby when the shooting began. His father told BBC Arabic Ahmed \"saw the victims, the blood, women and children lying on the street, and then acted\".\\nFootage of the moment he sprung out from behind a car and wrestled a gun off one of the attackers immediately went viral. He was shot multiple times, and may lose his arm.\\nAnother man, Reuven Morrison, was also seen on the video hurling objects at the same attacker in the moments after Ahmed disarmed him.\\nSheina Gutnik easily recognised her dad in the footage.\\n\"He is not one to lie down. He is one to run towards danger,\" Ms Gutnick told BBC partner CBS News.\\nHe had jumped up the second the shooting started, she said, and was throwing bricks at one of the gunmen before he was fatally shot.\\n\"He went down fighting, protecting the people he loved most.\"\\nThe first two victims of the assault, Boris and Sofia Gurman, were also captured on dashcam footage grappling with one of the men for his weapon. When they succeeded, he got another gun from the car he\\'d just climbed out of and killed them.\\n\"Even in the final moments of their lives, they showed the depth of who they were by facing those moments with courage, selflessness and love,\" read a message from their proud son Alex, which was read out at the couple\\'s funeral on Friday.\\n\"In doing so, they reminded us that they were not only devoted parents, but, in every sense of the word, heroes.\"\\nThe list goes on.\\nChaya, only 14 years old, was shot in the leg while shielding two young children from gunfire.\\nJack Hibbert - a beat cop just four months into the job - was hit in both the head and the shoulder but continued to help festival attendees until he physically couldn\\'t, his family said. The 22-year-old will survive, but with life-changing injuries.\\nLifeguard Jackson Doolan was photographed sprinting over from a neighbouring beach during the attack, armed with critical medical supplies. He didn\\'t even pause to put on shoes.\\nOthers at Bondi rushed from the beach into the fire, their red-and-yellow lifesaving boards working overtime as stretchers. One lifeguard even dived back into the surf to save swimmers who\\'d been sent into a panic by the shooting.\\nStudent Levi Xu, 31, told the BBC he felt he could not shout for help, as he didn\\'t want to draw attention to himself or risk any potential saviours being targeted.\\nBut lifeguard Rory Davey saw him and his friend struggling, and dragged them back to shore.\\n\"We stood up and wanted to thank him, but he had already gone back into the sea to rescue other people,\" says Mr Xu.\\nThousands of Australians flocked to donate blood, dwarfing the previous record.\\nAuthorities say many off-duty first responders travelled to Bondi on Sunday - from as far as two hours away - simply because they knew there was a need. Likewise, healthcare workers rushed to hospitals when they heard of the attack, shift or no shift, confronting unspeakable trauma to save lives.\\n\"[They were] just coming into the station and saying \\'I\\'m ready to go\\'. Coming to the scene and saying \\'I\\'m ready... put me in\\',\" New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park told the BBC.\\n\"Normally on a Sunday night, there is staff available to run one operating theatre [at St Vincent\\'s Hospital].

Australians have responded to that act of hatred with love and sympathy for those in mourning.\"\\nDaniel Aghion, the President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the peak body representing Australian Jews, said he would \"need to see the details before making an assessment as to whether the measures are likely to live up to their billing.\"\\n\"We warned of the risk of not dealing with antisemitism in this country promptly and effectively after 7 October. It is an absolute tragedy that it has taken a massacre of Jewish and other Australians for that step to be taken.\"\\nDavid Ossip, president of NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, welcomed the changes. \"For too long, Australian Jews have been targeted through social media, hate preachers and university campus activities.

In videos shared by local media sites, armed officers appeared to detain people on the street just hours after Albanese made his speech.\\nAntisemitism envoy Jillian Segal, who also spoke at the press conference, said the country was \"at a very important moment not only for our community, but for fighting antisemitism around the world.\"\\nAlbanese said his government would be \"fully supporting and adopting\" the recommendations Segal put forward in July in a report.\\nHer report was criticised by some upon its release in July due to its implications for free speech, including plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. There were concerns for instance, that the funding could be used to silence pro-Palestinian protests.\\nThe Jewish Council of Australia said it supported Albanese\\'s commitment to act, including his focus on gun reform and online hate.\\nBut, it said it was \"concerned that elements of today\\'s announcement resemble long-standing proposals from the pro-Israel lobby which have nothing to do with addressing violent extremism.\"\\n\"If education initiatives like university scorecards become a form of ideological policing - particularly where they are used to limit legitimate criticism of Israel - they will only make Jews less safe, and do the opposite of combating antisemitism,\" Jewish Council of Australia executive officer Dr Max Kaiser said.\\nMeanwhile, Albanese acknowledged accusations from the Jewish community that his government had not done enough to prevent antisemitism since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, and said more could have been done.\\n\"I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia,\" he said. \"But what I also do is accept my responsibility to lead the nation and unite the nation. Because what people are looking for at this time isn\\'t more division.\"\\nHome Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government was \"shifting the threshold\" on hate speech.\\n\"There have been individuals who have managed to exploit a nation that had different principles of freedom of speech and have gone right to the limits of language that is clearly dehumanising, unacceptable, having no place in Australia, but have not quite crossed the threshold to violence,\" he said.\\n'},\n",

Maybe she [will] send some good vibes to the world.\"\\nJewish community leaders have in recent days suggested the tragedy was an inevitable result of Australia struggling to address rising antisemitism.\\nThe attack on Sunday was the country\\'s deadliest incident since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people during the Port Arthur massacre.\\nMourners - including the Governor General Sam Mostyn and New South Wales Premier Chris Minns - packed out the service in Sydney, wearing bee brooches and stickers in honour of the girl who adored them.\\nMichael and Valentyna had named their daughter after the song Waltzing Matilda, as a tribute to the country where their Ukrainian family found safety.\\n\"She\\'s waltzing with the angels,\" Minns said, reading a poem written for her.\\nRabbi Yehoram Ulman, who led the service, had to pause and collect himself as he paid tribute to Matilda\\'s short life.\\n\"The tragic, so totally cruel, unfathomable murder of young Matilda is something to all of us as if our own daughter was taken from us,\" he said.\\nThe service heard how she had lived with beauty, goodness and righteousness.\\n\"The Jewish ... believe that death is not eternal … it is not because we are naïve,\" Rabbi Ulman said.\\n\"I\\'m telling you with absolute conviction that the separation with Matilda is not forever.\"\\nStill, he conceded that his words would likely offer little comfort - something he knows too well. A day earlier, Rabbi Ulman spoke at the funeral of his own son-in-law, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, who was also killed in the attack on Bondi.\\n\"You give me strength at a time when you need strength yourselves. And I try to do the same,\" he said to Matilda\\'s parents, who sobbed in the front row.\\nMs Chernykh earlier said the family was devastated.\\n\"I look at their faces [and] I don\\'t know if they will be ever happy again,\" she said of Matilda\\'s parents.\\nMatilda\\'s younger sister, from whom she was \"inseparable\", is shattered and confused, she said. \"She doesn\\'t have enough tears to cry.\"\\nOn the same day the shooting\\'s youngest victim was laid to rest, its eldest was too. A service for Alexander Kleytman - an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor - was held at the same funeral home on Thursday morning.\\nIn a statement, his family said he died doing what he loved most: protecting his wife Larisa and celebrating his Jewish faith.\\n\"The two gunmen killed him, but his memories, his legacy, and his books will bring light for generations to come,\" it read.\\nTheir local Chabad mission later said Alexander had died \"shielding\" his wife from the gunmen\\'s bullets.\\nJewishCare, a local organisation, had praised the couple\\'s \"resilience, strength, and adaptability\" which \"serve as a testament to the enduring nature of the human spirit\" in its 2023 annual report.\\nBoth Larisa and Alexander had faced \"the unspeakable terror of the Holocaust\", the organisation said, adding that the couple immigrated to Australia from Ukraine.\\n\"Alex\\'s memories are particularly harrowing; recalling the dreadful conditions in Siberia where he, along with his mother and younger brother, struggled for survival.\\n\"The scars of the past, however, did not deter them from seeking a brighter future.\"\\nIn addition to his wife, he leaves behind two children and 11 grandchildren, Chabad confirmed in a statement.\\nA funeral was also held on Thursday for another victim, 78-year-old Tibor Weitzen, who was described as a family man \"above all else\".\\nHis daughter Hanna Abesidon spoke at his funeral and said his love for his family was \"constant, unconditional and deeply felt\", ABC News reported.\\n\"I\\'m so sorry I couldn\\'t save you. I\\'m so sorry,\" she said.\\nPolice have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been \"motivated by Islamic State\" group ideology.\\nPolice allege that the two gunmen were a father and son. Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead at the scene, while his son Naveed, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act.\\nTwo people out of the 16 injured who remain in hospitals are still in critical condition, local authorities said.\\nAustralia on Thursday announced it would strengthen laws to crack down on hate - including by introducing powers to cancel or refuse visas on grounds of antisemitism.\\n'},\n",

Two rabbis and a Holocaust survivor were also killed.\\nThe ages of the victims range from 10 to 87.\\nThe family of British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, told the BBC he was among the dead. He had helped organise the Hanukkah event, Jewish organisation Chabad said.\\nRabbi Schlanger\\'s cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis, described him as \"vivacious, energetic, full of life and a very warm outgoing person who loved to help people\".\\nAlso among those killed was Rabbi Yaakov Levitan, described as a \"popular co-ordinator\" of Chabad activities in Sydney.\\nAlexander Kleytman, a Holocaust survivor, was killed while trying to shield his wife, Chabad says.\\nIsraeli media report that an Israeli citizen was also killed, and French citizen Dan Elkayam has also been identified as a victim of the attack.\\nA further 42 people were taken to hospital due to their injuries.

       "  'Article': 'Sunday dawned hot and clear at Bondi - not a cloud in the sky, the sun shining as the waves crashed onto the sand.\\nIt was a day made for the beach. By midday, the entire stretch was heaving with thousands of people and the sea was full of swimmers and surfers. Our family of four, on holiday at Bondi Beach, was among them.\\nAs we headed to the beach, crossing on a footbridge from the carpark of Campbell Parade, I noticed people were setting up white tents on the grass next to a children\\'s playground.\\nA truck arrived, carrying a climbing wall. Later we would learn they were preparing for a Jewish community event, called Chanukah by the Sea, to celebrate the start of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.\\nIn the late afternoon, loud upbeat music boomed from the speakers and across the beach. The event had begun. Our family packed up our things at the beach at about 18:00 local time (07:00 GMT) to go back to the holiday home we had rented nearby.\\nAs we crossed the footbridge again, we saw hundreds of people - families with young children and grandparents - at the event. A stage had been set up for live performances with rows of chairs set out in front. Activity stations and stalls lined the green. The mood was relaxed and festive as laughter and children\\'s cries floated in the air.\\nScores more people were streaming into the event via an entry point with what looked like bag checks. Metal barriers had been set up to fence the event off from the rest of the green, but there appeared to be minimal security.\\nAs the event looked like it could have food stalls, I suggested to my husband we check it out for dinner. \"Let\\'s just get pizza back at the house,\" he sighed - the kids were getting cranky and needed a shower.\\nSo I went back with the children, while my husband stopped by a pizzeria for a takeaway.\\nHalf an hour later, he returned home with the pizzas, and a worried look. While he was buying dinner, people had run past him in a panic. One of them stopped to say, \"Mate, get away from here, something bad\\'s happened.\"\\nWe could hear police sirens and the roar of helicopters. We checked the news, and I quickly went to the scene, which was just 100m from where we were staying.\\nPolice officers were just starting to cordon off the car park in front of the footbridge where my family and I had crossed over - and which the attackers used, not even an hour later, as a vantage point to shoot at the festival we had seen earlier.\\nMany people had gathered at a corner close to the cordon where there were bars and restaurants. Lively music blared during a beautiful sunset - an incongruous setting for what had become a deadly evening at the beach.\\nPeople were anxiously milling about, some crying and in shock. A few were desperately trying to get in touch with their loved ones who were stuck in the area that was being cordoned off.\\n\"My daughter\\'s at the surf club just over there, and I can\\'t contact her,\" one woman told me, her eyes filling with tears. Some were arguing with police at the cordon, insisting they needed to find their relatives or get to their cars or homes.\\nI caught a man running past - he told me his name was Barry. He had just fled the festival with his two children. When he heard gunshots, they dropped to the ground, he said.\\n\"And as we\\'re lying there on the floor, with my kids, I saw a shooter or two on the bridge on the side towards Bondi beach, shooting at all of us,\" he said. \"It was pandemonium and chaos.\"\\nSoon the restaurants and bars on the corner shut down, even as the crowd of onlookers and media grew.\\nAs the night wore on, police and emergency vehicles moved in and out of the zone, clearing what we learnt later was a car filled with IEDs.\\nA fierce wind whipped up from the beach, as officers tried to hold the cordon.\\nThe next morning, the main stretch of Bondi was deserted. Uncertainty, shock and anxiety still lingered. At the police cordon, a crowd thronged a cafe, buying coffees while worriedly discussing what had happened the previous night.\\nWatching the scene were Bondi residents Ali Pattillo, Abby Agwunobi and Brooke Schlesinger. The three women, all Americans, live in an apartment overlooking the shooting site. When they heard the gunshots, they thought it was fireworks.\\n\"I started hearing people kind of screaming and running, grabbed the dog and hid in the bathroom,\" Ms Pattillo said. \"And then you could just sort of hear the entire thing play out in this like horrible dream.\"\\nMs Schlesinger said the attack was such a shock because \"what appealed to us most about the Australian lifestyle is that sense of security and safety and community\".\\nAlthough the Bondi community was \"incredibly tight\", Ms Agwunobi said she was worried about \"the backlash and fallout that might happen from this\", particularly with \"the kind of climate with people being very anti-immigration.\"\\n\"So, yeah, I\\'m very afraid for the next few days. And my heart just goes to the Jewish community as well because... it\\'s just such a violation to happen, especially on a holy celebration\".\\nAcross the street, some people began laying out bouquets of flowers, balloons and an Australian flag at the corner of a primary school, in an impromptu memorial for the dead.\\nSoon, more people arrived to grieve at the spot. Some draped Israeli flags around their shoulders and wore kippahs, or Jewish skullcaps. People wept openly and embraced one another.\\nOthers expressed fear and despair, including Jewish people who said they had been feeling vulnerable after a spate of antisemitism-related offences. Yvonne Haber, a Bondi resident who is Jewish, said an attack like this has \"been waiting to happen, and we\\'ve been saying this is gonna happen. And now that it\\'s happened... it\\'s absolutely horrific.\"\\nAs the sun began to set, I went to Bondi Pavilion, which had become a shrine for mourners after police removed part of the cordon.\\nIsraeli and Australian flags hung on the closed gates of the pavilion, as hundreds of people gathered to lay wreaths, bouquets, candles and pebbles from the beach. The enormous pile of flowers framed a handwritten sign: \"We stay united, no more hate, just love.\"\\nAs 18:47 neared - the time of the attack the day before - a group of local Jewish leaders stepped forward with a large menorah with candles. They announced they were going to light the candles - a ritual associated with Hanukkah - to remember those killed in the attack, and urged the crowd to light their own candles from the menorah and take it home with them.\\n\"We invite the crowd to take the light, to spread peace and tolerance. We have survived for thousands of years... light will always prevail,\" Rabbi Yossi Shuchat announced to the crowd.\\nThen the group began singing traditional Jewish songs, with many in the crowd joining in. Their voices soared, cracked with grief, enveloping those gathered in a wave of pure emotion.\\nA woman behind me quietly sobbed as she sang and clapped along to the more spirited songs. At one point, the crowd broke out into the Australian national anthem.\\nAfterwards, Rabbi Shuchat told me that he and his friends had decided that morning to hold the ceremony for the victims - and to make a powerful statement.\\n\"Darkness has no power where light arrives, and therefore we implore everyone to be that light in their surroundings. Don\\'t allow evil to come. The best way to banish evil is to shine a light.\"\\n'},\n",

Among the dead are two rabbis and a Holocaust survivor.\\nThe two gunmen have been named in local media as 50-year-old Sajid Akram, who died at the scene, and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, who is in hospital in a critical condition. The two had reportedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.\\nRabbi Mirvis, who will travel to Sydney on Tuesday, said Jewish people had been \"targeted for the simple act of gathering together, visibly and peacefully, as Jews\".\\nThe right of Jewish communities to gather safely and publicly was a \"test of the moral health of any society\", he said.\\n\"Jews have lived with security concerns for as long as I can remember, but the fact that today every public Jewish gathering must be weighed for risk is a sign of something deeply wrong.\"\\nA society in which a minority group have to \"calculate whether it is safe to be seen together in public\" is a society that is \"failing all of its citizens\".\\nSir Keir, who spoke to Rabbi Mirvis on Sunday night, has pledged a \"more visible security presence\" at Hanukkah events following the attack.\\n\"It has impacted on Jewish communities here in the UK, that I know feel even more insecure today than they did before,\" he told a Commons committee on Monday.\\n\"This is clearly not an isolated incident, and these incidents are chillingly focused on some of the holiest days of the Jewish calendar,\" the PM said, referencing an attack on Heaton Park Synagogue on Yom Kippur that left two Jewish victims dead.\\nSir Keir said the government would \"take every step we can and use all powers\" to make British Jews safe.\\nFollow updates on this story\\nWhat we know about the attack\\nHolocaust survivor among victims\\n\\'My cousin was killed in Bondi Beach terror attack\\'\\nJustice minister Alex Davies-Jones travelled to Manchester to celebrate Hanukkah with survivors of October\\'s attack, which took place on the holiest day of the year for Jews.\\nAround 200 members of the Manchester Jewish community gathered at the synagogue to light the menorah for Hannukah and remember the lives lost in Manchester and in Bondi.\\nThe service was led by Rabbi Daniel Walker, who urged those present to find \"light in darkness\". The menorah was lit by the widow of Melvin Cravitz, who was killed in the attack.\\nEarlier, Rabbi Mirvis said he appreciated the work of the UK government and the police to protect British Jews, who he said were \"on the front line\" and had faced repeated \"terrorist attacks\".\\nBut he urged authorities to tackle the causes of hatred, \"not just the symptoms\".\\nHe called for people to stand together \"against the normalised rhetoric that demonises Jews and the only Jewish state\".\\nThe chief rabbi said that \"for far too long we have allowed chants such as \\'globalise the intifada\\'\", which he said \"incite hatred and which inspire people to engage in hate action\".\\n\"Why is it still allowed? What is the meaning of globalise the intifada? I\\'ll tell you the meaning... it\\'s what happened on Bondi Beach yesterday.\"\\nHe added: \"We have to be far stricter with regard to what people are allowed to say and to do in a way which incites the hatred, which produces the violence that we have witnessed.\"\\n\\nThe organisation that arranges security for UK Jewish communities, the Community Security Trust (CST), told the BBC that the UK has seen record levels of anti-Jewish hate crime, which began to increase immediately after the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel.\\nDave Rich, the CST\\'s head of policy, told the Today programme that \"we have had huge protests ongoing in our city centres and university campuses with language like calls for intifada\".\\n\"Jewish people see a connection between violent words and violent actions,\" he said, adding that the Bondi attack was \"the extreme end of this political spectrum\".\\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she was \"absolutely horrified\" by the attacks.\\nAsked if the government was doing enough to tackle antisemitism, she said: \"I think that for several years now we have not done enough.\"\\nThe prime minister\\'s spokesman, when asked a similar question, told reporters that there was already funding and efforts to crack down on antisemitism following the Manchester attack.\\nLord West, speaking on behalf of the government, later told the House of Lords that while there was \"no specific intelligence of a linked threat\" in the UK to the Bondi attack, \"we must remain vigilant\".\\nShadow attorney general Lord Wolfson - a relative of British Rabbi Eli Schlanger, who was killed on Bondi Beach - told a memorial in Parliament Square on Monday evening that the UK needed to be more muscular in fighting the root causes of antisemitic violence.\\nWhen the public health minister Ashley Dalton spoke of her solidarity with the Jewish community she was repeatedly met with boos and heckles from some of the crowd and cries of \"shame\", \"rubbish\" and \"stop the marches\".\\n\\nThe festival of Hanukkah commemorates how, some 2,150 years ago, a small band of Jews revolted against Emperor Antiochus, who had suppressed their faith and demanded conversion to ancient Greek religion on pain of death.\\nThe group, led by the Maccabee family, removed Greek idols from the temple in Jerusalem and, the story goes, were able to light its menorah for eight days with only one day\\'s oil.\\nRabbi Mirvis said the message of the festival was about Jews\\' \"refusal to be intimidated or erased\".\\n\"The Jewish community is nervous. The Jewish community is strong. The Jewish community is worried, but we\\'re tenacious. You\\'ll see us during the eight days of Hanukkah, we\\'ll be out there.\"\\n'},\n",

In the minutes that followed, two gunmen would kill at least 15 people, and injure dozens more, authorities said.\\nA local high school teacher, Chavi, told the BBC she dropped to the ground to protect her baby as \"bullets were flying above us\".\\n\"It was pandemonium and chaos,\" another attendee, who identified himself as Barry, said as he described watching a throng of people trying to escape the scene that had suddenly devolved into a nightmare.\\nIn one video verified by the BBC, upbeat music from the Hanukkah event can still be heard in the background as people crouch down and shots are heard, interspersed between shrieks.\\nThe eerily jubilant music continues playing while the camera pans over the grass, revealing prostrate bodies completely still, their condition unclear.\\nSeparate footage shows groups of people lying atop one another on the grass, as one woman tries to cover a young child\\'s head with her hand.\\nPanic soon spread from the park to the sand, where videos show terrified beach goers sprinting away from the gunfire.\\nScreams, honking car horns and ambulance sirens fill the air in the next chaotic minutes. Some cars crashed as people desperately tried to get away, witnesses have told the BBC.\\nA nearly 11-minute video, verified by the BBC, provides perhaps the clearest timeline of the attack - though it is unclear exactly how far into it the recording started.\\nIt begins as the two gunmen make their way across Campbell Parade - the long stretch of road, lined with cafes, that curves around the beach - and onto a pedestrian bridge above the park where the Hannukah event was taking place.\\nIt is from there that two men - named as Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed, 24 - allegedly use the elevated position to carry out the remainder of the attack, using what an expert told the BBC were \"two sporting shotguns\".\\nOne man, believed to be Naveed Akram, remains on the bridge, while the other makes his way towards the park on foot. Shots continue to echo at one-second intervals in some of the footage, while people can be heard screaming.\\nAs the older man, believed to be Sajid Akram, begins to move away from the bridge, he starts firing at people.\\nJust a few minutes later, a passerby - who is seen crouching behind parked cars - catches Sajid off guard and is able to wrest the firearm off him within a few seconds.\\nThe gunman stumbles away, and the man, who has been identified as Ahmed al Ahmed, points the firearm at him, before laying the weapon down against a tree and putting his hands up to signal to officers that he is not the suspect.\\nAhmed, who was shot twice during the attack, has been hailed as a hero and credited by New South Wales Premier Chris Minns for saving \"countless lives\" with his brave actions.\\nLess than a minute after being disarmed, however, Sajid Akram returns to the bridge and resumes shooting at people with another weapon.\\nThe shooting stops about two minutes later when it appears both men are hit by police fire.\\nAbout seven-and-a-half minutes into the clip, police arrive at the bridge where they are confronted with a highly charged scene - two men with gunshot wounds - the alleged gunmen - and a crowd of bystanders, some of whom appear to kick the men on the ground.\\nPolice later confirmed that one of the gunmen, Sajid Akram, was found dead at the scene, while the other was critically wounded and taken to hospital, where he remains.\\nPolice say both men lived about an hour\\'s drive from Bondi Beach at a house in Bonnyrigg, a suburb in Sydney\\'s west.\\nDays before the attack, however, they had decamped to a short-term rental in Campsie - about 30 minutes closer to the beach, media reports said.\\nTheir family home in Bonnyrigg has become one of the main focuses of the police investigation. Officers raided it on Sunday night.\\nFootage of the raid shows three people coming out of it with their hands up, while heavily armed police officers in tactical gear surrounded the perimeter.\\nThose people were arrested, but have since been released without charge.\\nIt is still unclear if the guns used in the attack were owned by the two men, but Sajid Akram owned six registered firearms and held a recreational gun license.\\nHis son, Naveed, was examined over his close ties to a Sydney-based Islamic State (IS) cell after authorities became aware of his activity in 2019, the ABC reported.\\nBut Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said an \"assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence\".\\nResidents on the otherwise quiet, suburban street have described how the tumult of the last 48 hours has unsettled the neighbourhood.\\n\"My daughter was yelling at me, \\'mum look outside\\' and I saw lots of police, lots of cars, sirens and loudspeakers calling them to come out,\" Lemanatua Fatu, who lives opposite the men, told the BBC.\\n\"Then I saw the news - I thought oh my goodness, it can\\'t be them.\"\\nAdditional reporting by Gabriela Pomeroy and Thomas Spencer\\n'},\n",

In almost every family, someone is fighting.\"\\nLocated on the north-west edge of the Kamchatka Peninsula, near the Sea of Okhotsk, Sedanka is more than 4,300 miles (7,000km) from Ukraine\\'s front lines.\\nThe American city of Anchorage, across the ocean, is roughly half that distance.\\nThirty-nine men from the village signed contracts with Russia to fight in the war from a total population of 258. Of these, 12 have been killed and another seven are missing.\\n\"All our men have left for the special military operation,\" a group of women told the regional governor when he visited in March 2024, using the Kremlin\\'s language for its war in Ukraine.\\n\"There is no-one to chop firewood for winter to heat our stoves,\" they added in an exchange shown on state TV.\\nThe BBC, along with Russian news outlet Medizona and volunteer researchers, has so far verified that 40,201 Russian soldiers were killed in 2025.\\nAccording to our analysis, we estimate that the total number killed in 2025 will reach 80,000, which would be the most deadly year for Russian losses in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion was launched on 24 February 2022.\\nThis calculation takes into account obituaries that cite 2025 as the year of death or burial, but we have not yet fully processed or cross-checked.\\nConfirmed deaths for 2024 now stand at 69,362 - roughly comparable to the combined totals for 2022 and 2023 - and the curve has steepened since late 2024.\\nWe have confirmed the deaths using official reports and a probate data registry - an official registry of cases after someone dies - as well as newspaper articles, social media posts from relatives or close friends and data from new memorials and graves.\\nIn total, the BBC has now identified the names of 186,102 Russian soldiers killed in the war.\\nThe true death toll is generally accepted to be much higher, as many deaths on the battlefield are not recorded.\\nMilitary experts believe our analysis might represent 45-65% of the total, putting the potential number of Russian deaths at between 286,000 and 413,500.\\nUkraine has also sustained heavy losses.\\nLast month, President Volodymyr Zelensky told French broadcaster France 2 that \"officially\" 55,000 Ukrainians had been killed on the battlefield.\\nIn addition, a \"large number of people\" are considered officially missing, he said, though he did not give an exact figure.\\nBased on estimates from sources including the UA Losses website, which the BBC has cross-referenced, we estimate that the number of Ukrainians killed is as high as 200,000.\\nMost Russians killed in the war have Slavic surnames.\\nBut losses are disproportionately high among small indigenous groups, especially in economically depressed areas of Siberia and the Far East, such as Sedanka.\\nSedanka is home mainly to Koryaks and Itelmens - indigenous groups who, under wartime rules, can be exempted from mobilisation.\\nAnti-war activist Maria Vyushkova says Russian state TV amplifies stereotypes about indigenous communities being \"born warriors\" and skilled shooters in order to encourage them to join the war.\\n\"Many indigenous communities take pride in that heritage as part of their identity. The Kremlin uses this pride to recruit for war,\" Vyushkova says.\\nOne of the men from Sedanka who joined the conflict was Vladimir Akeev, 45, a hunter and fisherman, who signed a contract with the army in the summer of 2024.\\nFour months later he was killed in combat.\\nMourners at his funeral in November 2024 were only able to reach the cemetery by snowmobile, and Akeev\\'s coffin arrived on wide wooden sleds.\\nElsewhere, confirmed losses from indigenous groups include 201 Nenets, 96 Chukchi, 77 Khanty, 30 Koryaks and seven Inuit.\\nAs a proportion of males between the ages of 18 and 60, this equates to an estimated 2% of Chukchi, 1.4% of Russian Inuits, 1.32% of Koryaks and 0.8% of Khanty.\\nThe BBC\\'s analysis shows that 67% of the dead are from rural areas and small towns - classed as those with populations under 100,000 people - even though 48% of Russia\\'s population lives there.\\nThe rate of losses was smallest in major cities, with Moscow having the least deaths per capita - five people for every 10,000 males, or 0.05%.\\nIn poorer regions, such as Buryatia in eastern Siberia, and Tuva in southern Siberia, the death rate is 27 to 33 times higher respectively than in the capital.\\nThe main driver of this gap between cities and rural areas is the difference in economic development, pay and education, says demographer Alexey Raksha.\\nAs a result, soldiers from poorer regions and ethnic minorities make up a larger share of the army and of the dead than the overall population, he says.\\nRegions with a high share of losses had lower life expectancy even before their men joined the war, another Russian demographer told the BBC.\\n\"For many, the driver is not only poverty but a lack of prospects - the feeling that there is nothing to lose,\" he says.\\nIn Sedanka, a monument to \"participants of the special military operation\" was unveiled in autumn 2024.\\nLast year, the regional government pledged to bestow the honorary title of \"village of military valour\" for the participation of its men in the war.\\nIt also promised a support programme for families of Sedanka\\'s soldiers.\\nYet the village has still not received its honorary title nor has much of the promised support for soldiers\\' families arrived.\\nRoofs on the homes of four contract soldiers were fixed after falling into disrepair, but only after significant media attention.\\nOne in five houses, built during Soviet times, has been deemed by the state to be unsafe.\\nIts sole school has been classed by officials as being in a state of emergency, with some walls at risk of collapse.\\nAll of this has been compounded by the loss of the village\\'s working-age men to Russia\\'s war in Ukraine.\\nAdditional reporting by Yaroslava Kiryukhina and Natalia Maca Groca.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Two more people have been detained by French authorities investigating the killing of a far-right student activist by suspected radical left militants in Lyon, bringing the total in custody to 11.\\nQuentin Deranque, 23, suffered a fatal brain injury when he was beaten and kicked during a protest last week on the sidelines of a conference held by Rima Hassan, a member of the European Parliament for hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI).\\nThe wave of arrests began on Wednesday and included two parliamentary aides to LFI politician Raphaël Arnault.\\nArnault said one, Jacques-Elie Favrot, had halted his work in parliament and his contract was being terminated. A second has had his rights suspended.\\nProsecutors say seven of the 11 suspects are being investigated for murder and the other four for helping others to evade police.\\nFavrot\\'s lawyer told reporters his client admitted being at the scene and committing violence but said \"he wasn\\'t the one who inflicted the blows that caused Mr Deranque\\'s death\".\\nAlthough the radical left party leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has sought to distance the party from Deranque\\'s violent death, LFI has come under attack from rivals across the political spectrum, less than a month before France votes in key municipal elections.\\nGovernment spokesperson Maud Bregeon has urged the party to suspend Raphaël Arnault from its parliamentary group because of the MP\\'s links to Anti-Fascist Young Guard, which has been blamed for the violence a short distance from Sciences Po University in Lyon.\\nThe political climate is febrile ahead of the March votes - seen as the last test of public opinion before next year\\'s presidential elections. Within the past month Sébastien Lecornu\\'s minority government had to survive two no-confidence motions to push through this year\\'s budget.\\nLFI party co-ordinator Manuel Bompard announced on Wednesday that the party\\'s Paris HQ was briefly evacuated because of a bomb threat, and went on to accuse a large cross-section of the political and media classes of making days of false and defamatory statements.\\n\"I call for an end to this absolutely despicable exploitation of the tragedy that took place last Thursday evening in Lyon, for which France Unbowed bears absolutely no responsibility,\" he told reporters. \"This climate should worry everybody.\"\\nVideos captured from the scene show three people lying on the ground coming under attack from a larger group, all of them wearing hoods.\\nA feminist anti-immigration group called Némésis said Deranque had been outside the venue to protect its members. Némésis has blamed Young Guard for the attack - an allegation it denies.\\nA minute\\'s silence was held in the National Assembly on Tuesday for the young activist, and politicians lined up to criticise the radical-left leader and his colleagues.\\nJordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally said Mélenchon had \"moral and political responsibility\" for what had happened and even former LFI MP Alexis Corbière called on the party to take stock politically of what had happened.\\nSébastien Lecornu said that \"without undermining the presumption of innocence\" LFI had to \"clean up\" its statements, ideas and its ranks fast.\\nMélenchon hit back, saying he refused to take lessons from Lecornu.\\nHowever, more moderate figures on the left such as Socialist ex-President François Hollande have accused LFI of being responsible for lowering the tone of politics in France.\\n\"It\\'s clear there can be no alliance in the municipal elections between the Socialists or reformist left-wing parties and LFI in the second round,\" Hollande said on Wednesday. \"The relationship is over.\"\\nFor months the party had indulged in a kind of \"brutalisation\" of debate so there was no political space between the far left and far right, said Hollande.\\nThe actions of police have also come in for criticism, as local forces were warned that Rima Hassan\\'s event was due to take place but riot police were not on the scene at the time of the fatal attack.\\nThe death of Deranque has prompted reaction across the border in Italy, where Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has described the attack as deeply shocking and \"a wound for the whole of Europe\".\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US aimed at ending Moscow\\'s war in Ukraine have concluded without a breakthrough.\\nThe trilateral meetings, held in Geneva, went on late on Tuesday but only lasted two hours on Wednesday.\\nAlthough US envoy Steve Witkoff had expressed optimism over the talks, both the chief Russian negotiator and Ukraine\\'s Volodymyr Zelensky indicated they had been \"difficult\".\\nAfter the main talks concluded, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky returned to the venue and held a closed-door meeting with the Ukrainian side for about an hour and a half. No details from that meeting have emerged.\\nSome progress was made on \"military issues\", including the location of the front line and ceasefire monitoring, according to a Ukrainian diplomatic source.\\nWhite House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said later on Wednesday that \"there was meaningful progress\" made on both sides, and an agreement to \"continue to work towards a peace deal together\".\\nBut an agreement on the issue of territory - without which no ceasefire can be envisaged - remains elusive, with Moscow and Kyiv\\'s positions still far apart.\\nRussia has not budged in its demand for full control of the eastern Donbas region - made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - which is a non-starter for Ukraine.\\nWhile conceding talks were challenging, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky added that they had been \"businesslike\" and said another meeting would take place \"soon\".\\nZelensky also described the negotiations as \"not easy\" due to the difference in the two sides\\' positions.\\nRustem Umerov cut a less downbeat tone, saying the discussions had been \"substantive and intensive\" and that while there had been progress, no details could be disclosed \"at this stage\".\\n\"This is complex work that requires alignment among all parties and sufficient time,\" Umerov said.\\nShortly before the end of the talks was announced, Zelensky accused Russia of \"trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage\".\\nThe Russian and Ukrainian delegations last met in US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi earlier in February, which led to the first prisoner exchange in several months. On Wednesday, Zelensky indicated that another swap might be forthcoming.\\nUS President Donald Trump, who spearheaded diplomatic efforts to end the war, has been signalling impatience with the deadlock between the two sides.\\nOn Monday, he said Ukraine had \"better come to the table, fast\" - a sentiment Zelensky has since rejected, saying it was \"not fair\" that his country should be the one asked to compromise.\\nFour years on from the start of Russia\\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, substantial distance still exists between Moscow\\'s demands and what Kyiv might consider a \"just peace\".\\nKyiv has long rejected Russia\\'s demand for the eastern Donbas, which would mean relinquishing Ukrainian sovereign territory, including several heavily fortified cities and a long defensive line in the region of Donetsk.\\nMany Ukrainians believe giving that territory up would leave the country vulnerable to another Russian invasion. Zelensky himself has drawn parallels with the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler annex the Czech territory of Sudetenland.\\nOn Tuesday, Zelensky told US media outlet Axios that any plan to hand over the Donbas would be rejected by Ukrainians if it were put to a referendum.\\nThe Ukrainian president is also working to ensure that robust security guarantees to deter Russia from attacking again are provided by Kyiv\\'s western allies.\\nAnother sticking point in the talks is the status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.\\nThe power plant – Europe\\'s largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. Ukraine wants Moscow to return it and Zelensky has previously said Kyiv could share control of the plant with the Americans - an arrangement Moscow is unlikely to agree to.\\nOfficials from Britain, France, Germany and Italy were present in Geneva and held talks with the Ukrainians on the sidelines of the trilateral meeting.\\nEuropean representatives have struggled to be included in the US-led negotiations, but Zelensky said European participation was \"indespensable\" for any final agreement.\\nIn a wide-ranging interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored on Wednesday, Zelensky confirmed there would be more talks in Switzerland and repeated that while progress had been made from a military perspective, \"on the political direction it\\'s more difficult\".\\nDuring the interview, he also said he could not really \"understand\" Trump\\'s relationship with the Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding \"for me it\\'s very, very painful that his attitude to Putin is sometimes...more good than Putin deserves\".\\nNext Tuesday will mark the fourth anniversary of Moscow\\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe war, which has resulted in tens of thousands of military and civilian casualties and displaced millions across Ukraine, continues to shape the lives of Ukrainians, with daily deadly aerial attacks across the country.\\nFour people were killed and 30 injured in Russian artillery and air strikes overnight on Tuesday. Power infrastructure too continues to be targeted across the country, leaving millions without light or heating in one of Ukraine\\'s coldest winters in years.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'It is not unusual for avalanches to be in the news in the northern hemisphere at this time of year, the height of the annual ski season.\\nBut Tuesday\\'s deadly incident in California, which took the lives of eight skiers and left one more unaccounted for, and the difficult situation in much of the Alps - where there have been more fatalities than usual this year - has put a spotlight on avalanches and how prepared winter sports enthusiasts should be for them.\\nThe two situations would seem to be very different. California has been coming out of a so-called snow drought and experts do not consider the latest snowfall exceptional.\\nBut droughts followed by intense snow can cause problems - the new snow is unable to bind to old snow underneath, which can either be very hard or non-existent, and therefore remains loose.\\n\\nEurope, however, has seen two major storms in a week and a large amount of heavy snow combined with strong winds, leading to high avalanche warning levels across an unusually large part of the Alps. Three Britons were among dozens killed in incidents so far over the season.\\nOne Alpine resort suggested that the current conditions could be the worst there this century.\\nRecent snows have also led to evacuations of several communities in Switzerland and northern Italy, as well as power outages and a train derailment at Goppenstein in the south-western Swiss canton of Valais.\\nBut is there a connection between events in Europe and California?\\nClimate change might seem an obvious culprit for the unstable weather conditions that have brought them about.\\n\"There is evidence that climate change will lead to sharper, more intense precipitation followed by long periods without,\" Simon Mason, senior scientist at SEI US, told the BBC.\\nThis would seem to be the case in Europe, which has recently had several seasons with lower than average snowfall, and some dry periods in the early part of this season.\\n\"However, since many factors control avalanche risk and precipitation is only one controlling influence, it is difficult to conclude how risks may evolve with future climate change,\" Mason said.\\nClimatologist Christoph Marthy told Swiss outlet SRF the current Alpine winter - with weather until recently dominated by high pressure and several long, dry periods - is exactly the opposite of a typical climate change winter.\\nBenjamin Zweifel, of the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, told the BBC the storms were \"only one piece of the puzzle\".\\n\"The main challenge this winter was a very weak snowpack [an accumulation of snow that compresses and melts seasonally] with very persistent weak layers, caused by long periods without new snow and low temperatures,\" he said.\\nWhile global warming affects weather patterns, the temperature itself could also have a direct impact on avalanches. According to the US Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, wet snow avalanches - which are likely to become more frequent as temperatures rise - are dangerous, difficult to predict and relatively poorly understood compared with the dry snow equivalent.\\n\"Wet snow avalanches are caused by weakening in the strength of the snowpack, often triggered by rain, abundant sunshine, or warm temperatures,\" the centre says in an article on wet snow avalanche research, adding their frequency was expected to increase with changing temperatures.\\nA 2021 research paper in the journal Frontiers in Physiology suggests wetter and warmer snow may also adversely affect a person\\'s chances of surviving an avalanche, while thinner snow cover may increase the risk of blunt trauma injuries.\\nBroadly, there would seem to be four destabilising issues that are changing the dynamics of avalanches - switching between droughts and heavy precipitation, the precipitation itself, wetter snow and snow which is actually melting.\\nBlaise Agresti, a high-mountain guide at Chamonix, told France\\'s Sud radio that there was another important factor in Europe\\'s spike in avalanche deaths - the changing behaviour of skiers and higher levels of risk.\\n\"People are increasingly practising off-piste skiing. Among skiers, 25% go off-piste,\" he said.\\nWay-marked pistes are generally protected by pre-emptive avalanche blasting, and their snow is flattened and compacted to further reduce the risk. If there is still a danger of avalanches, pistes can be closed off, as has happened during the recent warnings.\\nBut while forecasting and blasting techniques have improved in recent years, it is not impossible for avalanches to hit pistes that have been declared safe. There is no such thing as zero risk, and it may be advisable to keep away from pistes beneath mountainsides covered with powdery-looking snow.\\nSometimes resorts can detect a wider threat. The French resorts of Tignes and Val d\\'Isere even imposed a lockdown because of the avalanche threat, forcing residents and tourists to stay indoors.\\nIn general, though, resorts will not prevent tourists from going off-piste so instead they offer advice. Another French resort, La Plagne, for instance, tells skiers to get information about conditions, make sure they have the necessary safety gear - avalanche transceiver, shovel and probe - know how to use them, and always go out with a professional guide and never alone.\\nThe resort, which has one of the world\\'s largest off-piste areas, holds weekly safety days in high season and has recently invested in a drone equipped with a thermal camera for use in avalanche detection and rescue operations.\\n\\n\\nThomas Hager, a ski guide based in the Zell am See region in the Austrian Alps, told the BBC World Service\\'s Outside Source programme that sometimes it was easy for snow sports enthusiasts to be complacent.\\n\"Snow looks so calm. It\\'s comparable to water,\" he said. \"In an ocean you don\\'t see undercurrents but local people know where the undercurrents are and where avalanches go off frequently. So please always talk with local people and listen to the avalanche forecast.\"\\nHe also suggested it was vital to carry an air-bag, which is not required by law but could help keep avalanche victims close to the surface of the snow.\\nThough the recent spike in avalanche deaths in Europe is worrying, it is not exceptional - according to European Avalanche Warning Services, 95 have died so far this season, compared to 70 in the whole of 2024-24 and 87 in 2023-24. The 2020-21 season, when 131 died, and 2017-18, when the figure was 147, seem comparable.\\nBut if you ask weather watchers about the situation, a different picture emerges. Meteo France\\'s team in Bourg-Saint-Maurice near the Italian border, told the BBC the region went from below-average snowfall to \"remarkable\" above-average snowfall in under 10 days.\\n\"Statistically speaking, we experience a situation like this once every eight years. This means a very significant avalanche risk,\" it said.\\nMeanwhile the Val d\\'Isere resort, in its Thursday weather bulletin, said a third wave of 30-50cm (12in-20in) of snow - after the two storms - would have to be taken very seriously and required \"certain precautions\".\\n\"The situation has not been seen for a long time (perhaps since February 1999),\" it added.\\nSo have modern avalanche-warning systems and safety measures taken by resorts in recent years kept casualty figures down?\\nBenjamin Zweifel believes the situation could be a lot worse without these factors, and says he sees a \"big effect\", at least in Switzerland.\\nHe notes, though, that France and Italy have both seen higher fatalities - 25 in each, compared to Switzerland\\'s 13 - but says this could be linked to \"even more challenging conditions\" in the western and southern Alps.\\nThe worst could be over, though. The weather is expected to improve from Friday, giving resorts the space to carry out more safety work and allowing the snowpack to settle.\\nHowever, sunny, south-facing slopes will lose some of their snow, potentially leading to greater risks for off-pisters.\\n'},\n",

We have changed the names of everyone we have spoken to for this piece.\\nEven his daily treat on the way to work - an Americano from a local cafe - has suddenly surged 26% from 230 to 290 roubles.\\nPrices have risen steadily in Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in Ukraine, driven by a federal budget dominated by the war effort and defence industry.\\nThis in turn has led to rapid economic growth and raised living standards across the country.\\nUntil now, high levels of inflation have gone largely unnoticed by the general population, especially in the big cities such as Moscow and St Petersburg. Big spending masked the mounting economic consequences of the war, as well as Western sanctions and the exodus of foreign investment from Russia.\\nThat rapid economic growth slowed sharply in 2025, and as salaries could no longer keep up with inflation, rising prices started to hit people\\'s pockets.\\nThen at the start of 2026, supermarket prices jumped by a sharp 2.3% in less than a month, according to data from Russia\\'s statistics service Rosstat.\\nEverything became more expensive at the start of the year: meat, milk, salt, flour, potatoes, pasta, bananas, soap, toothpaste, socks, laundry detergent, and many medicines too.\\nEvery other January since 2019, the BBC has bought the same selection of 59 basic goods from the same supermarket chain, Pyaterochka, in Moscow. The basket includes vegetables and fruits, dairy and meat products, canned goods and instant noodles, sweets and beverages, including beer.\\nIn 2024, the basket cost 7,358 roubles (£63; $83). Last month, it cost 8,724 (£83; $112) roubles - an increase of 18.6%.\\nThat tallies with Rosstat\\'s own 18.1% measure of overall accumulated food inflation from January 2024 to the end of January 2026.\\nOne of the most noticeable price increases in our basket has been a hike of almost 15% in the cost of fruit and vegetables since 2024.\\nRussia relies on imported fruit and vegetables, so store prices are highly sensitive to fluctuations in the rouble exchange rate and disruptions in the supply chain. Both occurred after the beginning of the war in Ukraine.\\nAt the same time, the price of dairy products - which tend to be locally produced - has soared 41%, the biggest rise in our sample basket in the last two years. This is because Russia\\'s dairy industry has been hit by rising farm costs, expensive loans and staff shortages.\\nThe most recent factor influencing price rises is a two-point increase in VAT from 20% to 22% since 1 January.\\nThe sales tax hike is directly related to the war in Ukraine, as Russia\\'s finance ministry said it was needed to finance the country\\'s \"defence and security\".\\nWhile Alexander from Moscow told the BBC he was not going to change his eating habits, others say rising food prices have hit their diets and family budgets significantly.\\nNadezhda, 68, says she can no longer afford to buy beef and has resorted to cheap varieties of fish.\\nShe and her husband, who are both retired, live in Moscow on their state pensions and his additional income. Nadezhda says her entire monthly pension of almost 32,000 roubles (£302; $413) now goes on food.\\nThat means other expenses have been put on hold.\\nThey had been saving to fix their car, but recently had to rely on savings to pay for food. Similarly, buying a new winter jacket for Nadezhda\\'s husband, which would have cost about 17,000 roubles (£160; $220), will have to wait until next year.\\nKristina, a Moscow marketing specialist in her mid-40s, also had dig into her savings to buy food last month. She lives with her husband, who is a personal trainer, and says she has started paying attention to discounts and has noticed others in supermarkets doing so as well.\\n\"Now I take a very pragmatic approach: not what I want or don\\'t want to eat, but how much protein is in 100 grams of this product,\" Kristina says.\\nShe and her husband can no longer afford to eat out, but even when cooking at home, the price of a dinner for two has more than doubled - from around 1,000 roubles (£9.46; $12.92) to more than 2,000 roubles (£18.91; $25.85).\\nIn summer 2025, Russia\\'s Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said that the economy was close to a \"scenario of balanced rates of economic growth\".\\nHowever, some economists suggest that after slowing down significantly last year, the Russian economy is now at risk of going into the red.\\nOne of the main risks this year will come from the oil market.\\nThe federal budget is based on a high oil price, but market rates have fallen since the start of this year and there is no expectation of any imminent rise.\\nRussian oil sales have also been hit by latest US sanctions that have cut off supplies to one of Moscow\\'s main trading partners, India.\\nAs a result, Russian authorities are likely to face a bigger budget deficit than they had planned.\\nBorrowing is difficult due to high interest rates - few are willing to lend to a country currently waging war and with a reputation for being unreliable.\\nThat could mean further unpopular measures - either further tax rises, which would hurt people and businesses, or cutting budget spending, primarily in the public sector. That would slow down the economy and bring down household incomes further.\\n\"Overall, there is a trend towards stagnation and a possible decline in GDP,\" Tatiana Mikhailova, an economist and visiting assistant professor at Penn State University, told the BBC.\\nFor the moment nothing indicates the economy is in decline, but she believes there is a high likelihood of it happening.\\n\"Every time oil prices fall, a recession is possible in Russia,\" she says, even if she believes the economy can carry on without growth for some time.\\nThat may be of little comfort to ordinary Russians, who will still feel the effects in their pockets.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The war in Ukraine is about to enter its fifth year. Over the past year, Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control, mostly in the east of Ukraine, and have continued their barrage of air strikes on Kyiv and other cities.\\nSome 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, while the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia\\'s side.\\nWith the fourth anniversary of the Russia\\'s full-scale invasion approaching, here\\'s a look at the situation on the ground in Ukraine.\\nAnalysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), say Russia took about 4,700 sq km (1,800 sq miles) of territory in 2025 - an area about twice the size of the city of Moscow - although Russia claims to have taken 6,000 sq km.\\nIn eastern Ukraine, Moscow\\'s war machine has been churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - also known as the Donbas - surrounding and overwhelming villages and towns.\\nIt has been trying to gain full control of the area along with two more regions to the west - Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Shortly after the invasion, Russia held referendums to try to annexe all these regions - in the same way it had annexed Crimea in 2014 - but it has never had them under full control.\\nThere is some evidence that Elon Musk\\'s decision to deny Russian forces access to his Starlink satellite-based internet service at the start of February has given Ukraine an advantage.\\nUkraine requested the move as evidence grew that Starlink was enabling Russian forces to mount increasingly accurate attacks, including multiple instances of units being attached to drones, allowing operators to use real-time video links to guide drones on to targets.\\nIn some areas of the long front line, especially east of the city of Zaporizhzhia, Russian forces appear to have been forced to retreat.\\nUkraine hopes that any territorial gains will strengthen the its position at the negotiating table.\\nIt comes after a US-backed peace plan unveiled in November, suggested Ukraine could cede control of all of Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea, along with the areas of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson that Russia currently occupies, to Moscow.\\nUkrainian forces would have had to withdraw from parts of Donetsk they still hold and this would become a demilitarised area under de facto Russian control. Russian forces would withdraw from the small areas of Ukraine they currently occupy outside those regions.\\nZelensky has consistently said Ukraine will not hand over the Donbas in exchange for peace, saying such a concession could be used as a springboard for future attacks by Russia.\\nA recent report by the ISW describes a \"fortress belt\" running 50km (31 miles) through western Donetsk.\\n\"Ukraine has spent the last 11 years pouring time, money, and effort into reinforcing the fortress belt and establishing significant defence industrial and defensive infrastructure,\" it writes.\\nA Russian summer offensive near the eastern town of Pokrovsk did make rapid advances just north of the town and Russia has recently made advances in the town itself and to the east of nearby Kostyantynivka.\\nThe town, once a key logistics hub for Ukraine\\'s military, is already in ruins.\\nRussian officials previously claimed to have captured Pokrovsk, known in Russian as Krasnoarmeysk, which includes a major road and railway junction that used to connect the upper parts of the Donetsk region with key cities to the west, such as Dnipro.\\nBut Ukraine says it still holds northern parts of the town, which could give Moscow a platform to drive north towards the two biggest remaining Ukrainian-controlled cities in the Donetsk region, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.\\nIts fall would be Russia\\'s biggest battlefield victory since it took the city of Avdiivka about 40km (25 miles) to the east in early 2024.\\nUkraine is losing ground, but the ISW notes Russia has been trying to take Pokrovsk - a town of about 23 sq km - for nearly two years and that cities in the fortress belt are \"significantly larger\".\\nIt suggests that it would take Russian forces another two years to seize the remainder of the Donetsk region \"at great cost\".\\nWhy Donetsk \\'fortress belt\\' matters so much for Ukraine\\'s defences\\nWhy did Putin\\'s Russia invade Ukraine?\\n\\nFurther north on the main front line, Russia has been trying to advance on the city of Kupyansk, which analysts suggest could allow it to encircle the northern Donetsk region.\\nIt has also been trying to push Ukrainian forces back from the border with the Russian region of Belgorod.\\nISW analysts say Russia is trying to create a buffer zone inside Ukraine\\'s northern borders and get within artillery range of Kharkiv, Ukraine\\'s second-biggest city.\\nRussia\\'s forces have recently gained limited control over a spear of land to the south of Vovchansk that would bring them closer to this target.\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin says he wants this buffer zone to protect Russia, after Ukrainian forces captured a swathe of territory further north in Kursk in the summer of 2024. Russian forces eventually drove them out, with the help of North Korean troops.\\nAs well as the counter-offensive in the Kursk region, Ukraine has struck air bases deep inside Russia. One of these attacks involved using 100 drones to target nuclear-capable long-range bombers.\\nThe Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the attacks had occurred in five regions of Russia - Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur - but stated planes had been damaged only in Murmansk and Irkutsk, while in other locations the attacks had been repelled.\\nMore recently a massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Volzhsky, in the Volgograd region in Russia, was reported on 11 Febriuary.\\nDeep strikes are seen as a critical part of the war - Ukraine is trying to target Russia\\'s war economy to slow the advances on the front line.\\nRussia has also been carrying out strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure - in particular its energy facilities such as electricity substations and power plants.\\nSeveral people have been killed in the attacks and tens of thousands of people across Ukraine have experienced severe power cuts or been left with no running water or heating during some of the coldest months of the winter.\\nThe attacks were paused for a week following a request from US President Donald Trump to Putin.\\nTrump has been leading efforts to end the war through negotiations, and Zelensky said this month that the US wanted the war to end by June.\\nHowever, the most recent round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US in Geneva, Switzerland, concluded without a breakthrough on 18 February.\\nSome progress was made on \"military issues\", including the location of the front line and ceasefire monitoring, according to a Ukrainian diplomatic source.\\nWhite House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said later that \"there was meaningful progress\" made on both sides, and an agreement to \"continue to work towards a peace deal together\".\\nBut an agreement on the issue of territory - without which no ceasefire can be envisaged - remains elusive, with Moscow and Kyiv\\'s positions still far apart.\\nRussia\\'s full-scale invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.\\nRussian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv.\\nRussian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.\\nBut they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly-motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.\\nUkrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.\\nBy October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and, having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson.\\nSince then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months.\\nBoth Kyiv and Moscow have regularly published estimates of the other side\\'s losses but they have been reluctant to detail their own.\\nAs of six months ago, Ukraine\\'s interior ministry had recorded more than 70,000 people as officially missing - both soldiers and civilians - but the breakdown is never given and the true figure may be higher. However, Zelensky said at the start of February that 55,000 soldiers had been killed.\\n\\nBy Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, Paul Sargeant, Chris Clayton, Kady Wardell, Camilla Costa, Mark Bryson, Sana Dionysiou, Gerry Fletcher, Kate Gaynor and Erwan Rivault\\nTo indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute\\'s Critical Threats Project.\\nThe situation in Ukraine is often fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Evidence is mounting that Elon Musk\\'s decision to deny Russian forces access to his Starlink satellite-based internet service has blunted Moscow\\'s advance, caused confusion among Russian soldiers and handed an advantage to Ukraine\\'s defenders.\\nBut for how long? And what can Ukraine\\'s military achieve in the meantime?\\n\"The Russians… lost their ability to control the field,\" a Ukrainian drone operator who goes by the callsign Giovanni told us.\\n\"I think they lost 50% of their capacity for offence,\" he said. \"That\\'s what the numbers show. Fewer assaults, fewer enemy drones, fewer everything.\"\\nIt\\'s still early to assess the impact of a change that only came into effect at the beginning of the month, after Ukraine\\'s defence minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, asked Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX company to block Russian access to Starlink.\\nBut in some areas of the long front line, especially east of the city of Zaporizhzhia, there is some evidence of Russian forces being forced to retreat.\\nThe request from Federov came as evidence mounted that use of Starlink was enabling Russian forces to mount increasingly accurate attacks, including multiple instances of $400 (£300) units being attached to drones, allowing operators to use real-time video links to guide drones onto targets.\\nSpaceX\\'s satellite communications have proved vital to both armies during the four-year war. It\\'s widely believed that a deadly Russian attack on a moving passenger train in the Kharkiv region last month involved a Geran-2 drone, equipped with a Starlink terminal.\\nBut since 1 February, all that has changed. SpaceX switched off all terminals operating in Ukraine, except those on a \"white list\" approved by the Defence Ministry in Kyiv.\\nPrivate users across the country had to re-register their units, along with their personal ID numbers, before being reconnected.\\nAt this point, Ukrainian online activists from volunteer group InformNapalm decided to exploit the situation, launching a successful phishing operation that persuaded Russian soldiers to reveal details of their Starlink terminals.\\n\"When people started messaging us, we directed them to closed group chats,\" says Mykhailo Makaruk, spokesman for InformNapalm. \"We wanted to show that it was top secret.\"\\nMakaruk says his group successfully identified 2,425 Starlink terminals, from the Crimean peninsula in the south to the city of Gomel in eastern Belarus.\\nBelieving they were on a fast track to having their terminals reconnected, some soldiers were even tricked into making online payments totalling $5,000.\\nOnce the locations of the terminals close to the front lines had been established, many were targeted by Ukrainian artillery and drones.\\nAmid reports that Russian soldiers were attempting to bribe Ukrainian collaborators to register Starlink terminals on their behalf, InformNapalm identified around 30 people who had been ready to share their data.\\nA week ago, Ukraine\\'s Security Service, the SBU, said it was \"actively countering Russian attempts to recruit Ukrainian citizens for the illegal registration of Starlink systems\".\\nThe SBU has warned all Ukrainians \"to remain vigilant and not fall for such provocations\", warning that collaboration with Russia is regarded as high treason and can lead to lengthy prison sentences.\\nMakaruk says Russia\\'s FSB Security Service is issuing its own warnings, telling soldiers not to fall for the scam, but he says the phishing operation has had a disruptive psychological effect.\\n\"They don\\'t trust each other anymore,\" he says, sharing screenshots of expletive-laden Russian chats in which the dangers of keeping a Starlink terminal nearby are discussed.\\nOn the battle front, Ukrainian soldiers have noticed a difference too.\\nDeprived of Starlink\\'s high speed, jam-resistant internet connectivity, their Russian opponents have been scrambling to find workarounds.\\n\"In our area, they began to use radio communication,\" one told the BBC, on condition of anonymity. \"It became easier to understand their actions.\"\\nSigns of hasty Russian adaptation have been observed up and down the long front line.\\n\"The Russians are now urgently switching to wired communication,\" another told us.\\nArtem, a soldier with an engineering unit, said his Russian opponents were struggling to guide their drones as effectively as before.\\n\"This is important for the protection of our critical infrastructure, logistics and control points,\" he said. \"The Russians have lost frontline communications in many places.\"\\nUkrainian military analysts say the impact on drone strikes on Ukrainian logistics and positions far from the front is crucial.\\n\"Russian drone operators [used] to control and directly strike selected targets 100-250 kilometres from the front line,\" said Serhii Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Co-operation Centre.\\n\"Now they no longer have this capability.\"\\nIn a war where the speed of communication can mean the difference between life and death, some Ukrainian soldiers sense this is a moment of real opportunity.\\n\"If we can beat the enemy\\'s command transmission by even five or 10 seconds, it\\'s a total game-changer at the front,\" one told us.\\nUkraine\\'s military intelligence (HUR) has published what it says are intercepts of Russian communications, which it says illustrate the frustration at the failure of some home-grown systems to compensate for the lack of Starlink.\\n\"From what I know, this \\'Gazprom\\' [terminal] is just total crap,\" one Russian soldier is quoted as saying, apparently referring to equipment produced by Gazprom Space Systems, using its own Yamal satellites.\\nThe BBC is not able to verify the source of the alleged intercept.\\nHUR\\'s conclusion, in a press release on Tuesday, was that the shutdown of Starlink \"has already led to serious problems with unit co-ordination, logistics, and the deployment of various unmanned systems – from ground-based to aerial drones.\"\\nVideos circulating on social media, which the BBC has not verified, purport to show Russian soldiers being targeted by Ukrainian drones while attempting to rig up alternative wi-fi bridges on electricity bridges and TV towers.\\nNot all Ukrainian soldiers are convinced that the situation has changed dramatically, with some saying they have noticed little difference, or suggesting that other factors, including the weather and planned troop rotations, may also be at play.\\n\"Drone and artillery shelling continue as before,\" one told us.\\nIn Moscow, Russian military officials, speaking on state TV, said the loss of Starlink had not affected their operations, with one claiming that Starlink had only been used by a handful of units, \"primarily to mislead the enemy\".\\nSpeaking to the BBC from his position close to the contested eastern city of Pokrovsk, Giovanni said it wouldn\\'t be long before the Russians figured out a solution.\\n\"I have no doubt they will adapt,\" he said.\\nHow long this will take is anyone\\'s guess.\\nIn the meantime, Ukrainian forces are trying to take as much advantage as possible, attempting to expand the dangerous expanse of no-man\\'s land between the two sides, an area often described as the \"grey zone\" or \"kill zone\".\\n\"We\\'re clearing up the grey zone now,\" Vlad Voloshyn, spokesman for the army\\'s Southern Command, told the BBC.\\n\"We try to strike the enemy wherever they are.\"\\nVoloshyn disputed media reports that Ukraine had launched a major counter-offensive, recapturing more than 200 sq km (77 sq miles) of territory in a matter of days last week. The goals, he said, were more modest.\\n\"We didn\\'t let the enemy entrench in the grey zone and we stopped their storm groups,\" he said.\\nFormer Ukrainian intelligence officer Ivan Stupak says the military probably has a couple of months in which to exploit the current situation.\\n\"The Russian armoured forces on the ground are partly blind and partly deaf,\" he says. \"Maybe they will be so frustrated and demoralised that even a small counter-offensive could be on the same scale as 2022.\"\\nA repeat of the lightning successes of the summer and autumn of 2022, when Ukrainian forces retook huge swathes of territory in the north and the south, seems unlikely at this point.\\nBut Stupak says any territorial gains will strengthen the Ukrainian leader\\'s position at the negotiating table.\\n\"We could repulse Russian forces, regain our territory and then we could start this negotiation, but with new cards,\" he says.\\n'},\n",

The Ukrainian gene pool is dying. This is about the survival of our nation,\" the soldier tells me, speaking by phone from a position somewhere near the eastern frontline.\\nThe 35-year-old is serving with Ukraine\\'s National Guard and when he returned on leave recently his wife persuaded him to visit a clinic in Kyiv and leave a sperm sample.\\nIt was frozen free of charge as part of a programme to help serving soldiers.\\nIf Maxim were killed, his wife could use the sample to try to have the child they\\'ve always wanted.\\nBut he says his frozen sperm could be crucial to creating a family, in any case.\\n\"Whether you are right on the \\'zero point\\' of the frontline, or 30 or even 80 kilometres back, there is no guarantee that you\\'re safe,\" the soldier says, explaining that Russian drones overhead are a constant threat.\\n\"That means stress, and this [can have] an impact: your reproductive ability declines. So we have to think about the future and the future of our Ukrainian nation.\"\\nPrivate fertility clinics began offering what\\'s known as cryopreservation to servicemen and women in 2022 at the start of Russia\\'s full-scale invasion.\\nThey could freeze their sperm or eggs for free in case they were injured in action or their fertility was affected.\\nThe following year parliament stepped in to regulate the practice and provide state funding.\\n\"Our soldiers are defending our future, but may lose their own, so we wanted to give them that chance,\" is how MP Oksana Dmitrieva describes the law she helped draft.\\n\"It\\'s to support them, so they can use their sperm later.\"\\nThe politicians\\' initial efforts caused a public outcry though, when they stipulated that all samples should be destroyed on a donor\\'s death. That came to light when a war widow tried to have a child using her husband\\'s frozen sperm and was blocked.\\nThe law has since been amended so that all soldiers\\' samples are preserved for free for up to 3 years after their death and are available for a partner to use with prior written consent.\\nThe programme is also about addressing a demographic crisis which existed before Russia\\'s invasion but has been made far worse by the large numbers of men dying in action, many of them Ukraine\\'s youngest and fittest.\\nThen there\\'s the millions, mainly women, who have left as refugees. Four years on, many are still abroad because life in Ukraine isn\\'t getting easier.\\nThat fact is driven home when I meet the MP in a hotel lobby and we talk without removing our coats: this winter Russia\\'s relentless missile strikes on the power grid have left thousands of buildings in Kyiv freezing cold.\\n\"We\\'re also thinking about the future and all the young people we\\'ve lost. We need to replace them,\" Dmitrieva says. \"This is one tiny step to improve the demographic situation.\"\\nOn her own visits to the frontline the MP encourages soldiers to talk about their sex lives and fertility problems – and to think about freezing their sperm.\\n\"At first they\\'re really embarrassed, but we talk and I tell them to tell others, and then they come and they do it,\" she says.\\n\"If they have this chance, then why not? It doesn\\'t hurt!\"\\nKyiv\\'s state-run Centre for Reproductive Medicine began accepting soldiers onto the \"frozen sperm\" programme in January.\\nOnly a dozen or so have signed up so far but the clinic is confident that will change once word gets out.\\n\"We expect big demand. We have high hopes,\" director Oksana Holikova says, leading me towards the laboratory where the \"biomaterial\" is collected, prepared, and then stored.\\nGiant vats open with a puff of what looks like dry ice to reveal long, slim tubes suspended inside, full of sperm.\\nOur route through quiet corridors reveals the hidden strains of this war: just one newborn gurgling in a cot, and one woman in labour. The number of pregnant patients the clinic sees has dropped by half since the start of the all-out war.\\n\"If women are stressed, they [can] have problems with their periods. It\\'s all linked,\" Holikova points out. \"About 60% of my patients are on anti-depressants, including people with panic attacks because of the missiles and drones.\"\\nOthers have what she terms \"delayed life syndrome\": putting major life decisions, including childbirth, on pause.\\n\"Women are scared of getting pregnant if they\\'re going to end up running to bomb shelters.\"\\nSo Ukraine needs every newborn child possible.\\nBut the legislation to help military families doesn\\'t always work smoothly.\\nKaterina Malyshko and her husband Vitaly had been trying for a baby for a while. She believes their problems conceiving naturally were caused, or at least exacerbated, by the war: \"all the stress and sleepless nights,\" Katerina says. \"Every night is like a lottery: you don\\'t know whether you\\'ll wake up.\"\\nThe young couple would have celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary this year, perhaps with a new baby. Last winter they had three viable embryos at the fertility clinic and Katerina was due to have them transferred to her womb.\\nThen Vitaly was killed.\\n\"It was a direct hit with a guided bomb, he had no chance,\" she tells me.\\nKaterina talks frankly about her struggle just to go on living without her husband. Her pain was then made even more acute when the clinic said she had no right to continue treatment with the frozen embryos or Vitaly\\'s sperm.\\n\"They would store it,\" she says. \"But I couldn\\'t use it.\"\\nThe MP, Oksana Dmitrieva, has intervened directly with some clinics to ensure soldiers\\' families get treated. But she admits the new law still needs \"ironing out\".\\nA vote on several amendments is due in Spring.\\nBut Katerina, desperate and grieving, had to turn to the courts and it was only six emotionally exhausting months later that a judge finally decided in her favour.\\n\"I read the ruling and sat there and cried. Because it was our family. We had waited to long for that and been through so much,\" Katerina recalls.\\n\"I felt joy and grief at the same time because I\\'d had to fight for my rights. But I wanted to do it, to honour my husband.\"\\nKaterina isn\\'t ready to try for a child just yet: she feels too fragile.\\nShe also has no hopes the war will end soon, which would allow her to give birth in a country at peace.\\n\"If we compromise now, then what did so many people die for?\" is her reaction to the idea Ukraine might give up land Vitaly was killed defending, for Russia to stop its invasion.\\nBut Katerina does want the option of having her husband\\'s baby when she\\'s ready for that.\\n\"I think the children of our soldiers who\\'ve been killed should have a chance to live: they have the right to live in the country their parents died for.\"\\nOut on the frontline, in constant danger, Maxim agrees.\\n\"That\\'s why I did it, and it\\'s great!\" the soldier tells me over the phone. \"Because maybe tomorrow, I\\'m suddenly gone. But my wife will have my sperm and can use it. It\\'s one less thing for me to worry about.\"\\nThe biggest problem Maxim sees is persuading men to sign up for the programme.\\nThe Kyiv clinic director, Oksana Horlikova, recalls talking to one war veteran who told her soldiers were coming to him in tears because they were struggling to have sex with their partners or conceive.\\n\"Men are secretive, but there are lots of psychological problems,\" Maxim admits.\\nSo he suggests soldiers could be told to freeze their sperm when they\\'re drafted, like they leave DNA samples to identify them if they\\'re killed.\\n\"All that\\'s holding people back is that we need to talk about this more and explain why it\\'s important,\" the soldier concludes.\\n\"Because we men won\\'t do anything, unless you shove it in our face – and make us.\"\\nAdditional reporting by Tetiana Dankevych\\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

       "  'Article': 'Downtown Munich is best-known for chic shops and flashy fast cars but right now its streets are bedecked with posters advertising next generation drones.\\n\"Europe\\'s security under construction\" boasts the slogan on an eye-catching set of sleek black-and-white photographs, festooned across a scaffolding-clad church on one of this town\\'s best known pedestrian boulevards.\\nSuch an unapologetic public display of military muscle would have been unimaginable here just a few years ago, but the world outside Germany is changing fast, and taking this country with it.\\nThe southern region of Bavaria has become Germany\\'s leading defence technology hub, focusing on AI, drones and aerospace.\\nPeople here, like most other Europeans, say they feel increasingly exposed - squeezed between an expansionist Russia and an economically aggressive China to the east, and an increasingly unpredictable, former best pal, the United States, to the west.\\nAccording to a recent Eurobarometer poll, more than two-thirds of Europeans (68%) feel their country is under threat.\\nThis autumn, Germany\\'s Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance warned for the first time since the Cold War that war is no longer \"unlikely\". While emphasising that this is a safe country, it also recommends that Germans keep food supplies to last three to ten days at home. Just in case.\\nGermany is the number one single donor of military and other aid to Ukraine, now that the US has halted any new direct aid. Opinion polls suggest voters here want to feel better protected at home too.\\nThe question for this country, along with others in Europe is whether traditional alliances with the US, in Nato and the EU can suffice, or whether they should be diversifying into ad-hoc coalitions alongside other like-minded nations such as Australia, South Korea and Japan?\\nBy 2029, the German defence budget will be higher than the UK and French equivalents combined, Nato\\'s Secretary General Mark Rutte pointed out to me.\\nHe described the €150bn they say they will spend on defence as \"a staggering amount\".\\nIt\\'s something the United States notices and appreciates, he said. Donald Trump is far from the first US president to insist that Europe do more for its own security, though his tone has been noticeably more threatening than that of his predecessors.\\nThe precarious state of transatlantic relations was the main focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) this weekend. It\\'s the world\\'s biggest annual defence meeting, bringing leaders, security experts and defence industries together.\\nWhile it\\'s easy to dismiss speech-heavy get-togethers like this as wind-baggy talking shops, in the turbulent times we live in, they can make a difference - especially the informal private huddles between global decision makers, far away from the glare of the cameras.\\nThe most eagerly - and for some the most anxiously - anticipated speech at this year\\'s conference was that of the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who represented the Trump administration here.\\nEuropean leaders and top diplomats were seriously on the edge of their seats. But why was a simple 30-minute address given so much importance?\\nIt\\'s because Europe-US relations have never been so frayed as they are now, over the last 80 years since World War Two. And this isn\\'t a bust-up between buddies that will easily blow over.\\nIn the just over 12 months since Trump returned to the White House, he has at times insulted and undermined European leaders, slapped big tariffs on their exports, and most shockingly of all to his allies in Nato, threatened Danish sovereignty over its territory, Greenland, refusing for a while to rule out taking the island by force.\\nSpeaking at the MSC on Saturday, Denmark\\'s still clearly furious prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Trump\\'s designs on Greenland remained \"the same\" despite ongoing trilateral talks between representatives of Greenland, the US and Denmark.\\nTrump has ruled out taking Greenland by military force for now, and he\\'s backed away (for the moment, at least) from slapping economic sanctions on allies, including the UK, France and Germany, that were getting in the way of the US acquiring the Arctic island. But transatlantic trust was severely damaged.\\nEuropean powers see in Trump a truly transactional president who thinks nothing of leveraging security or economic relations with his closest allies to get what he wants. Just before being re-elected president, for example, he told Europeans that the US would not protect nations that didn\\'t pay their way on defence.\\nIt is true though, that Europe has been coasting on America\\'s security blanket for decades. Critics in the US argue that European nations have been able to run generous welfare states for decades while Washington picked up the tab for security spending.\\nGermany\\'s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, told me on Saturday: \"We got used to the strong support from the US; we got used to our comfort zone in which we used to live. This time is over, definitely over,\" he said. \"Washington was right.\"\\nBut the crisis over Greenland and other actions by the Trump administration - such as when it temporarily paused intelligence-sharing with Ukrainian forces last March, leaving them blind on the battlefield, in order to pressure Kyiv into engaging in peace talks with Moscow - have left deep scars and a troubling sense of transatlantic wariness.\\nHence the trepidation in Munich before Rubio took the stage.\\nIn the end, his words were laced with a sense of historic kinship. \"We want Europe to be strong,\" he said. \"The two great wars of the last century serve for us as a constant reminder that ultimately our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.\"\\nI found it telling that so many leading European figures in the audience jumped on the warmth of his words, rising to their feet to applaud the US Secretary of State. They were clearly relieved he hadn\\'t threatened or berated Europe as the US Vice President JD Vance famously did at last year\\'s MSC.\\nBut for those listening closely, Rubio\\'s speech was loyal to themes close to the heart of the Trump administration and hard for many European leaders to swallow: anti climate action, sceptical of globalisation, multilateralism, migration and pro the building of a new era of Christian western civilisation.\\nRubio was clear: the US wasn\\'t interested in allies clinging to the old status quo. It wanted to forge a new path, ideally alongside Europe, but only if it shared the same values.\\nThis US offer of close partnership was conditional and absent of a sense of compromise.\\n\"A bit like a (psychologically) abusive partner,\" said one European diplomat, speaking candidly on condition of anonymity. \"He reminded Europe how wonderful the (transatlantic) relationship used to be, but he then switched to coercion: If you want things to be good between us in the future, you have to do as I say!\"\\nAnother diplomat pointed out that, while talking of shared values, it was telling, he said, that of all the European countries that Rubio could have gone to after making his speech in Germany, he chose to visit Slovakia and Hungary before heading back to the US.\\nThey are viewed by Brussels as two of the EU\\'s most problematic members, both with Eurosceptic nationalist prime ministers who oppose sending military aid to Ukraine and who are tough on migration.\\nRubio\\'s softer tone also divided European leaders who had recently spoken as one, in defence of Denmark, at the height of the Greenland crisis last month.\\nThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, underlined a now fragile relationship with the US, despite Rubio\\'s gentler rhetoric. \"Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore,\" she said. \"Europeans have suffered shock therapy.\"\\nBut will some countries in Europe grasp what warmness there was in Rubio\\'s speech as an excuse not to rush to boost defence spending as promised? The coffers of most European governments are over stretched already and their voters tend to prioritise cost-of-living concerns over defence budgets.\\nRachel Ellehuus, Director-General of defence think-tank RUSI told me she sees a rift opening up across the continent.\\nOn the one hand, you have the Nordic and Baltic nations that are geographically close to Russia, and also Germany and the Netherlands, which are all big defence spenders, she says, whereas in southern Europe, there\\'s Spain, for example, that is absolutely unapologetic about refusing to increase defence budgets to the levels demanded by Donald Trump.\\nFrance and Britain are both verbally committed to boosting defence spending, says Ellehuus, but are still looking for a \"political band aid\" to help them explain to voters the trade-offs that will involve - higher taxes, less welfare or more borrowing.\\n\"Europeans need to get to work yesterday and to focus,\" she says. \"They have 5-10 years to stand on their own two feet in terms of conventional defence capabilities.\"\\nLast week, U.S. Undersecretary of Defence Elbridge Colby couldn\\'t have been more stark in his messaging at a meeting of Nato defence ministers he attended in Brussels: Europe was no longer a US priority, the Indo-Pacific was.\\n\"Under President Trump\\'s leadership, we are reprioritising the defence of our homeland and the protection of our interests in our Hemisphere,\" he said.\\nWhile he emphasised that the US remained committed to Nato\\'s mutual defence clause, where an attack against one member is viewed as an attack against all, Colby insisted the US would be reducing its capabilities in Europe, becoming \"a more limited and focused\" presence.\\nEurope had to become a partner, rather than a dependent, he said, calling for a new \"Nato 3.0\". The old world order with the West at its core, has faded but the MSC this weekend made clear that what comes next for Europe and the US is still very much up in the air.\\nMarco Rubio called for a new century of western civilisation, Elbridge Colby wants a re-vamped Nato, while the UK\\'s prime minister appealed in Munich for the western alliance to be re-made.\\nIn stark contrast to Marco Rubio\\'s insistence on greater national sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer spoke in favour of greater integration between the UK and Europe on defence - to cut re-armament costs, though, he emphasised this did not mean the UK turning its back on the United States.\\nSophia Gaston, national security expert at Kings College London, told me that in Munich, Starmer was able to better articulate the nuance of Britain\\'s strategic outlook.\\n\"Other allies in Europe may be more willing to speak of divergence from Washington\", she says, \"but for Britain it remains a strategic imperative to triangulate within the Transatlantic relationship. There will also be times when Britain will have to make hard choices, and Starmer appeared more confident in confronting that reality.\\n\"The key is to have a really strong grasp of the national interest and our instruments of power and influence. This requires a much more competitive approach that has not always felt natural to Britain, which has typically pursued much of its diplomacy in elegant, consensus-focused and invisible ways.\"\\nIn these fast-moving, unpredictable times, Europe\\'s leaders are increasingly turning to a la carte coalitions, alongside traditional organisations like Nato or the EU, which are larger and therefore often slower to react. These groupings also include non-European nations.\\nTake, for example, the so-called Coalition of the Willing group of countries, led by the UK and France and formed to secure Ukrainian sovereignty in the case of an eventual peace deal with Russia. Turkey has attended coalition meetings, as have New Zealand and Australia.\\nCanada is increasingly working alongside Nordic and Baltic nations that share geopolitical challenges and common values, they say, and want to promote stability and deterrence from the edges of the Baltic Sea, through the Nordic and Baltic states, through the North Atlantic, Greenland and across the Canadian arctic.\\nOne European policy-maker who asked not to be named joked to me that Canada was becoming \"more and more European by the day\". Japan and South Korea were increasingly seen as part of the \"like-minded family\" too, he said.\\nThese ad hoc coalitions are not restricted to defence alone. France\\'s President Macron has long called for Europe to increase what he calls its strategic autonomy, in traditional security terms but also energy security, supply chains and new technologies. In Munich he recommended Europe \"de-risk\" from all outside powers.\\nThis weekend even saw the president of the European Commission admitting that if the EU failed to move fast enough on improving competitiveness, \"a group of its member states would have to move forward alone\".\\nAttempts by smaller pockets of European powers to work together to advance European strategic independence are by no means always successful. Take the current row between France and Germany over their joint attempt to come up with the next generation of fighter jet with the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).\\nYou could also say that for all the talk of building European independence, this weekend\\'s conference was also a reminder of just how dependent Europe remains on US security support - from its nuclear umbrella to intelligence sharing and command and control structures. It was also a reminder of how far Europe trails the US in high tech innovation.\\nBut more than short-term mechanisms designed to \\'survive\\' Donald Trump, the changes we are witnessing in Europe, including closer alliances outside the continent, are liable to be longer lasting. The world now seems to dance to the tune of big power politics. And even slow-moving Europe is having to adapt.\\nTop picture credit: AFP / Getty Images\\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The judge noted that no distress signals were sent.\\nThe defence argued that at that point Thomas P and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.\\nWebcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.\\nBut shortly afterwards, the defence said the situation changed dramatically, when Kerstin became exhausted close to the summit.\\nThe defence said that she told Thomas P to go to get help.\\nAt 00:35 on 19 January, he called the mountain police.

Her boyfriend is accused of leaving her unprotected and exhausted close to the summit in stormy conditions in the early hours of 19 January 2025, while he went to get help.\\nThe trial has sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders.\\nProsecutors say that, as the more experienced climber, the man on trial was \"the responsible guide for the tour\" and failed to turn back or call for support in time to help his girlfriend.\\nIdentified by Austrian media as Thomas P, he denies the charges and his lawyer, Kurt Jelinek, has described the woman\\'s death as \"a tragic accident.\"\\nThe tragedy unfolded after the couple began their climb of the 3,798m (12,460ft) Grossglockner.\\nProsecutors accuse Thomas P of making mistakes from the outset and have published a list of nine errors.\\nAt stake is the question of when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability. If the climber is found guilty it could mean \"a paradigm shift for mountain sports\", says Austria\\'s Der Standard newspaper.\\nKey to the case is the charge by state prosecutors in Innsbruck that he was to be considered the \"responsible guide for the tour\", as \"unlike his girlfriend [he was] already very experienced in high-altitude Alpine tours and had planned the tour\".\\nThey said he attempted the trip even though his girlfriend had \"never undertaken an Alpine tour of this length, difficulty, and altitude, and despite the challenging winter conditions\".\\nThey also allege he started out two hours too late and had failed to take \"enough emergency bivouac equipment\".\\nHe also \"allowed his girlfriend to use... snowboard soft boots, equipment that is not suitable for a high-altitude tour in mixed terrain\", say prosecutors.\\nThe defendant disputes this.

Both had \"relevant Alpine experience\" and were \"in very good physical condition\".\\nOnce on the mountain, prosecutors say the man should have turned back, when it was still possible, because of strong winds of up to 74km/h (45mph), and the winter cold.

To the man\\'s \"complete surprise\", the woman \"suddenly showed increased signs of exhaustion\", although by then turning back was too late.\\nAt 00:35 on 19 January, he called mountain police. The content of the conversation is unclear but the lawyer says he asked for help and denies telling police that everything was fine. Police allege he then put his phone on silent and did not take any more calls.\\nKurt Jelinek says the couple managed to reach an area about 40m (130ft) below the cross marking the summit of the Grossglockner.\\nAs the defendant\\'s girlfriend was too exhausted to move, he left her to find help, scaling the summit and descending on the other side, he says. Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00am.\\nHis torchlit figure is captured on webcam images as he descended from the summit.\\nProsecutors say he did not use aluminium rescue blankets or other gear to protect her from the cold and waited until 03:30 before notifying emergency services.\\nBy that point it was most probably too late. The strong winds meant that no helicopter rescue could take place during the night.\\nKerstin G died alone in the snow on the frozen mountainside.\\nHer social media feed suggests she was a keen mountaineer and her mother has told German media that she loved mountain hiking at night.\\nThomas P\\'s lawyer says he is \"deeply sorry\" for her death. \"Above all, he would like to express his sincere condolences to the family of the deceased,\" Mr Jelinek said.\\nIf found guilty, Thomas P faces up to three years in prison.\\nAnd a guilty verdict could also have implications for other mountain climbers, and how much they could be liable for their companions in the future.\\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

Details of ownership and management are deliberately opaque - names, identification numbers and flags are frequently changed.\\nEfforts have been stepped up to tackle shadow fleets in recent months and a number of sanctioned tankers have been seized.\\nIn January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia.\\nMoscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states\\' jurisdictions.\\n'},\n",

The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.\\nGalushchenko previously said he would defend himself against the accusations.\\nFormer Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov was arrested in November on suspicion of \"illicit enrichment\", having already been charged with abuse of office.\\nTimur Mindich, a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky\\'s former TV studio Kvartal95, reportedly fled the country after he was flagged as a suspect.\\nThat the figures were accused of enriching themselves from Ukraine\\'s energy sector caused particular outrage domestically, as the scandal broke as Russia stepped up attacks on Ukraine\\'s energy infrastructure ahead of a bitterly cold winter.\\nThe former Soviet Union member has long been plagued by issues of corruption, which have continued despite Nabu and Sap operating for a decade.\\nCracking down on corruption is seen as a key requirement for Ukraine joining the EU.\\n'},\n",

He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.\\nEpibatidine, the toxin the UK and its European allies have said was used to kill Alexei Navalny, was first derived from a group of poison dart frogs native to northern South America.\\nThough epibatidine has previously been investigated as a pain killer and for relief from painful inflammatory conditions of the lungs, it has been deemed too toxic to use clinically.\\nSpeaking to BBC Russian, toxicology expert Jill Johnson said it was \"200 times more potent than morphine\".\\nBy acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause \"muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death,\" Johnson said.\\nThe extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in particular wild frogs in tiny quantities, and only when the frogs eat a specific diet, she told the BBC.\\nResearchers believe the frogs acquire it through their diet because animals from different habitats have displayed different levels of the toxin, and those raised in captivity have none.\\nJohnson described it as an \"incredibly rare way to poison a person\".\\nShe added: \"Finding the wild frog in the correct location that is eating the specific diet to create the correct alkaloids is almost impossible...almost.\"\\nBefore Saturday\\'s announcement, Navalny\\'s wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently argued that her husband was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024.\\nIn September last year, Navalnaya said analysis of smuggled biological samples carried out by laboratories in two countries showed that her husband had been \"murdered\".\\nShe did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results.\\nReacting to the announcement, Navalnaya said: \"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof.\\n\"I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,\" she added.\\nAccording to the state-run news agency Tass, Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: \"All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West\\'s pressing problems.\"\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".\\nAt the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to the penal colony.\\nAccording to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk at his Siberian penal colony, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'It has been described as Germany\\'s most \"spectacular\" bank heist in years.\\nOn a quiet weekend just after Christmas, a group of thieves broke into a High Street bank in the western town of Gelsenkirchen, by boring through a wall with an industrial drill.\\nThey looted more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes and made off with millions of euros.\\nOver a month later, police have yet to make an arrest.\\nFor the bank\\'s clients, some of whom say they have lost their life savings and precious family jewellery and valuables, this is a time of anger, confusion and shock.\\nThere is a strong sense that trust in institutions has been shaken.\\nThe case has thrown up all sorts of difficult questions, and some of them have been spelled out by Herbert Reul, the interior minister in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.\\nWhy did no-one notice what was going on? Was it an insider job?\\nWhy did no-one hear the drill and how did the thieves know exactly where the vault was?\\nWere the bank\\'s security systems too weak?\\nPolice in Gelsenkirchen are appealing for witnesses to come forward.\\nInvestigators believe the thieves probably broke into the Sparkasse savings bank in Nienhofstrasse through the next-door multi-storey car park in the town\\'s Buer district.\\nThe thieves may have tampered with an escape door between the car park and the bank, they believe.\\nUnder normal circumstances the door could not be opened from the outside, but the gang managed to make sure it no longer closed properly, allowing them \"unhindered access from the car park to the Sparkasse building\".\\nFrom there, police believe they overcame several security systems and made their way into an archive room next to the vault, in the bank\\'s basement.\\nThey set up the drill and bored a hole 40cm (15.7in) wide in the wall leading to the strongroom, where the safe deposit boxes were kept.\\nThe heist must have taken place some time between Saturday 27 and Monday 29 December, according to officials, who think the burglars may almost have been caught shortly before reaching the vault.\\nJust after 06:00 on 27 December, the fire brigade in Gelsenkirchen and a private security firm received a fire alarm warning from the bank, which may have been triggered by the thieves.\\nPolice and 20 firefighters arrived at the bank at 06:15, \"but could not find anything that indicated damage\", police said in a statement.\\nThe fire alarm had come from the vault, Herbert Reul revealed.\\nBut firefighters could not get in because it was locked with a roll shutter. Reul said they saw \"no smoke, no smell of fire, or damage\", so they \"concluded it was a false alarm\", which he said was not unusual.\\nHe told a state parliament committee the police did not have the right to search the bank at the time, as it was a matter for the fire brigade. They would have needed a warrant.\\nOnce inside the vault, the thieves opened almost all the 3,250 safe deposit boxes, taking cash, gold and jewellery.\\nReul said that computer systems in the bank show that the first box was broken into at 10:45 on 27 December and the last at 14:44. It is not clear whether they managed to open most of the boxes in four hours or if the technology stopped recording data.\\nWitnesses later told police they saw several men in the stairwell of the car park carrying big bags during the night into 28 December.\\nAuthorities say they do not know exactly how much was taken, but German media estimate the thieves must have got away with up to €100 million (£87m).\\nPolice subsequently released photos and video footage from the car park\\'s security cameras, which showed men with their faces covered, and two cars, a black Audi RS 6 and a white Mercedes Citan. Both had fake licence plates.\\nThe theft was not discovered until 29 December when another fire alarm went off at 03:58 on the Monday – and firefighters returned to the bank to find a scene of chaos.\\nHerbert Reul said it looked like \"a rubbish dump\", with more than 500,000 items strewn across the floor - the contents of the safe deposit boxes that the thieves had left behind.\\nPolice said many items were damaged after the thieves threw water and chemicals on them. They have since been painstakingly sorting through the debris, searching for clues and trying to establish what belongs to whom.\\nAs details of the heist emerged, about 200 clients gathered outside the Sparkasse, demanding to be let in. Police arrived with several patrol cars and secured the entrance.\\nJoachim Alfred Wagner, 63, said he had lost not only gold worth tens of thousands of euros, but also jewellery that belonged to his father and grandparents.\\nHe had rented the safe deposit box after several break-ins at his apartment, thinking that his valuables would be safe there. \"I cried with rage,\" he said.\\nThe bank has said the contents of security boxes are generally insured for €10,300 each.\\nWagner is one of the first people to file a lawsuit against the bank, suing for damages for what his lawyer, Daniel Kuhlmann, has called lax security. Another had deposited €400,000 in cash from the sale of a flat which had been meant for their retirement.\\nThe bank has said it was itself a victim of the crime and that its premises were \"secured in accordance with recognised state-of-the-art technology\".\\nWhile some clients had official receipts for the contents of their safe deposit boxes, others do not.\\n\"Even the Sparkasse doesn\\'t know what is in [the boxes] because each person can put whatever they want into them,\" Herbert Reul said.\\nHe stressed that the psychological damage shouldn\\'t be underestimated.\\n\"We need to help the victims,\" he said. \"For many, this is more than just the loss of property, this can also impact their trust in their own sense of security and... their trust in our order,\" he said.\\nPolice Chief Tim Frommeyer said they were dealing with \"one of the biggest criminal cases in the history of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia\".\\n\"My department and all of its employees are aware of the magnitude of this case. The financial damage, uncertainty, and frustration run deep!\"\\nShortly after the theft was discovered, Germany\\'s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party held a rally outside the bank, prompting some to accuse the party of trying to stir up trouble.\\nGerman magazine Der Spiegel said the heist had become a political issue and a symbol of something greater than the crime itself: \"The feeling that promises of security are hollow, that institutions are failing, that ultimately no-one is being held accountable.\"\\n'},\n",

She also reveals she still has unanswered questions she wants to ask her now ex-husband - the man she refers to as \"Mr Pelicot\" - in jail, where he is serving a 20-year term.\\nWarning: This article contains accounts of rape and sexual abuse\\nThe Hôtel de Ville in central Paris, with its ceiling frescoes and rich wood panelling, is a far cry from the drab courtrooms in which Ms Pelicot was last seen publicly, during the four-month trial that shook France.\\nShe describes the moment that marked the beginning of what she calls her \"descent into hell\".\\nShe had accompanied her husband, Dominique Pelicot, to a police station near their home in Mazan, southern France. He had been summoned for secretly filming underneath women\\'s skirts in a supermarket.\\nMs Pelicot was taken aside by a policeman, who started asking her a series of increasingly probing questions. What kind of man was her husband? A great guy, she answered. Had they had ever engaged in swinging? No, of course not, she protested.\\n\"He told me: \\'I am about to show you something you won\\'t like.\\' I didn\\'t understand right away.\"\\nThe officer showed her two photos of a lifeless woman lying on a bed. They were among thousands of pictures and videos her husband had taken of her while she was drugged.\\n\"I didn\\'t recognise myself,\" she says. \"This woman was lying on the bed as if she were dead. There are men next to her. I didn\\'t understand who they were. I didn\\'t know them. I\\'d never met them.\"\\nShe pauses, fiddling with her red-framed reading glasses. As she recounts the shock that engulfed her, her voice grows quieter but never falters.\\nPolice told Ms Pelicot that she had been repeatedly raped by dozens of men. Although her husband had recorded, labelled and neatly catalogued the videos of the rapes on a hard disk, many of the men could not be identified.\\nShe was advised by the police not to be alone after receiving this news. She went home in a daze and phoned a friend. \"I told her: \\'Dominique is in custody because he raped me and had me raped.\\' That\\'s when I used the word rape. It was after five hours of questioning that I put words to Mr Pelicot\\'s crime.\"\\nOutside the UK, watch the Newsnight interview on YouTube\\n\\nHer three grown-up children - David, Caroline and Florian - also had to be told what their father had done.\\n\"I was well aware that for my children it was going to be immensely difficult,\" says Ms Pelicot. She now believes making those three phone calls was the hardest thing she has ever had to do.\\nShe remembers Caroline\\'s reaction: \"I heard my daughter scream. It was almost inhuman, that scream.\"\\nShe remembers David, her eldest, being in a state of shock, and Florian, the youngest, immediately asking how she was.\\n\"They realised I was alone, and that I might do something stupid. For them, too, it was like an explosion.\"\\nHer children travelled to be with her in Mazan the following day. All three have since recalled destroying or throwing out the family\\'s belongings - from furniture to photo albums - in an attempt to cancel their father\\'s existence.\\nTheir mother stood by and watched.\\n\"I told myself that my life was in ruins, that I had nothing left apart from my children.\"\\nSince David\\'s birth, when Ms Pelicot was in her early 20s, her children had been the centre of her life. Motherhood became a way to leave behind a childhood steeped in sadness.\\n\"I lost my mother at a very young age, my brother and my father too,\" she recalls. \"So I needed to rebuild everything I had lost.\"\\nIn the interview, Ms Pelicot talks of her beloved parents, whose marriage profoundly shaped her own understanding of love.\\nShe was nine when her mother died of cancer, plunging her father and the family into grief they never truly recovered from. Meeting Dominique Pelicot - 19 years old, handsome and just as bruised by a tough upbringing - had provided her with a chance to start anew. They married in 1973.\\n\"We were very in love, and we threw ourselves into life. And we started a family, because that was the main goal for me,\" she recalls in a steady voice.\\nBy 2011, Ms Pelicot had started suffering from memory loss. She attributed this to neurological problems, but she was also suffering from persistent gynaecological issues. These were later proven to have been caused by the sedatives she was plied with, and the strangers who came to rape her multiple times a week.\\nShe consulted a number of doctors. Her husband was by her side throughout the inconclusive examinations. He was also there every morning after the night-time assaults.\\n\"It was inconceivable that this man who shared my life could have committed these horrors,\" says Ms Pelicot. \"I would get up and have breakfast, and he would look at me in the eye. And I don\\'t know how he could have betrayed me for so many years.\"\\nShe would later learn that, alongside the drugs, her husband had given her powerful muscle relaxants, so that the next day she would not feel any pain for what her body had been put through.\\nShe now believes her abused body was close to giving up, and that her survival was at risk.\\n\"It is hard for me to recognise that he had no mercy,\" she says.\\nThe revelations have taken their toll on the whole family, says Ms Pelicot.\\n\"It\\'s wrong to think that such a tragedy brings a family together. It took us a long time to rebuild ourselves.\"\\nHer daughter Caroline, in particular, has been condemned to a \"perpetual torment\", she says, as photos of her asleep in her underwear were found on her father\\'s laptop.\\n\"The incestuous look he cast on his daughter, I found utterly unbearable.\"\\nMs Pelicot\\'s ex-husband has given contradictory explanations for those photos. Caroline is convinced he drugged and raped her too, but lack of additional evidence means he has never been prosecuted.\\nRelations between mother and daughter were strained during the trial, and Caroline said she felt like a \"forgotten victim\". At various times - both before and after the case – Ms Pelicot lost touch with some of her children.\\n\"It took Caroline time, because she\\'s filled with hatred and anger - feelings I don\\'t have,\" Ms Pelicot says. \"I have neither hatred, nor anger. I felt betrayed and outraged by Mr Pelicot, but that\\'s just how I am.\"\\nMs Pelicot says she and her daughter are now repairing their relationship.\\n\"Each of us needed time to find our own path. Today, we\\'re trying to bring each other peace, and I hope we\\'re on the right road to healing.\"\\nRevelation was to follow revelation. In 2022, police informed Ms Pelicot that her husband had admitted to the attempted rape of a young woman. He was also being investigated for the killing of a 23-year-old estate agent in Paris in 1991 - an allegation he denies.\\nThat her husband could be a murderer as well as a serial rapist is almost too much for Ms Pelicot to contemplate.\\n\"I dare hope he is not the perpetrator of this heinous crime, because otherwise it would once again be a descent into hell, both for me and for his children.\"\\nWhile the investigation was taking place, she relocated to the quiet Île de Ré, a small island off France\\'s Atlantic coast. \"I really wanted to stay in the shadows,\" she says. \"I absolutely didn\\'t want anyone to know who I was.\"\\nAs is the case for rape victims in France, Ms Pelicot was entitled to a closed-door trial - full anonymity, no media. She had pushed back on suggestions from her daughter to have an open hearing, worried about cementing her status as the victim of a heinous crime.\\nThen, walking on the beach, four months before the case began, something within her shifted.\\nA closed hearing would mean the men on trial would also benefit from anonymity, she realised. Moreover, it would leave her outnumbered - 51 men and 40 lawyers versus her, her small legal team, and her children.\\n\"For more than four years, I carried this shame,\" says Ms Pelicot. \"And I felt that it was like a double punishment for victims, and a suffering we imposed on ourselves.\"\\nHer lawyers gave her a week to decide whether she truly wanted to open the trial up to the public and the media. She only needed one night. \"By the next morning, I knew,\" she says.\\nIt was an extraordinary choice.\\n\"I have never regretted my decision, not once,\" she says. \"It was also a message to all victims who don\\'t dare to do the same… It could give them some of the strength I found in me.\\n\"Because,\" she says without hesitation, \"within us we have resources that we don\\'t even suspect. And if I was able to do this, all victims can too. I am convinced of this.\"\\nIn 2024, the Pelicot trial exploded into full view of France and the world.\\nThe ability to let the light shine through the depravity Ms Pelicot was subjected to - the \"filth\", as she repeatedly calls it - is a testament to her resilience.\\nEvery day, she held her head high as she walked into the Avignon courthouse. A throng of women assembled outside to show their support, and she acknowledged them with a slight nod and a hand on her heart.\\nSurrounded by dozens of cameras, Ms Pelicot says they gave her \"unbelievable strength\".\\n\"For me, they soothed what was happening within the courtroom,\" she says. \"On my own, I think it would have been difficult.\"\\nEven Queen Camilla reached out from the UK to express her admiration with a personal letter, which surprised her. \"I felt moved and very honoured... I am grateful to her,\" she says.\\nThroughout the interview, Ms Pelicot is composed and assured. Then, she is shown videos of French women, filmed by Newsnight, thanking her for her choice to have an open hearing.\\n\"Thank you for being so brave,\" says one woman.\\n\"We are here to support you! Life is beautiful, madame!\" says another.\\nAs one beaming face follows the next, Ms Pelicot, for the first time, wipes away a tear.\\n\"It touches me enormously because these are the faces I met during the trial,\" she says. \"I saw them putting up posters, I saw their collages, I saw the banners.\"\\n\"They were truly exceptional,\" she smiles.\\nIn the courtroom, Ms Pelicot and her family sat through nearly four months of veiled insinuations and open accusations of complicity from both the defendants and their lawyers. \"You go through hell in a courtroom. You\\'re really humiliated,\" she says.\\nAt the time, this led her to label what was unfolding as the \"trial of cowardice\". Now, too, her voice rises slightly as she recalls those moments.\\n\"They didn\\'t want to own up to what they had done,\" she says of the 50 men her husband had allowed to abuse her. She feels they acted as if they had committed a petty crime and refused to accept that she could not have given consent.\\n\"Then, the video attesting to the truth would be shown,\" she says. \"We could see that man raping me. He\\'d be asked those questions again, and would reply: \\'No, I didn\\'t rape her, I didn\\'t have any intention of raping her.\\'\\n\"So where are we supposed to go from there?\" she wonders aloud, exasperated.\\n\"I think that as far as they\\'re concerned, they couldn\\'t have raped me because Mr Pelicot was there and had given his consent. Therefore, they didn\\'t consider it rape,\" she concludes.\\nThe argument was rejected by the seven judges who oversaw the case. All the defendants were found guilty. Her former husband (their divorce was finalised shortly before his trial) was given a maximum sentence of 20 years. The other 50 men were jailed for terms between five and 15 years.\\nAs Ms Pelicot speaks, a tall bespectacled widower named Jean-Loup watches on discreetly. She met him on Île de Ré in 2023. \"We had this stroke of luck,\" she says, her voice measured and warm. \"We fell in love like teenagers, when neither of us was expecting it.\"\\nThey have been a couple ever since. \"Life put a man on my path who has the same values, the same principles as me - and who has also been through many ordeals in his life.\"\\n\"So you see,\" she continues, her head tilting to one side, \"life always holds beautiful surprises. It\\'s brought a lot of colour into our lives.\"\\nIt has been almost six years since Ms Pelicot was shown the photos of a woman who looked \"dead\". The question of why her ex-husband subjected her to years of abuse still looms large. Dominique Pelicot admitted in court he wanted to \"subdue an unbreakable woman\".\\n\"He would have liked me to participate in swinging sessions and I always refused because I have a sense of modesty,\" she says. \"I think he found a way around it by subduing me.\"\\nBut how he could have brought himself to do what he did is a different question. \"I might ask myself this for the rest of my life,\" she says.\\nMs Pelicot says she intends to visit him in jail to ask him what he may have done to their daughter Caroline, and the murder case he has been linked to.\\n\"I need to meet him to have answers. I don\\'t know if I will, but I need to look at him straight in the eye.\"\\nMeanwhile, the rebuilding of her life continues. \"I am healing,\" she says.\\nShe resists the idea of entirely disavowing the life she led with her ex-husband.\\n\"In order to live, I have needed to think that the 50 years I spent with Mr Pelicot were not all just a lie. Because otherwise, it\\'s as if I\\'d been dead. As if I no longer existed.\"\\nDuring one of the rare times she took the stand in court, Ms Pelicot told her ex-husband that his betrayal had been \"immeasurable\".\\n\"I always tried to lead you towards the light, but you chose the depths of the human soul,\" she said.\\nIt is a sentiment she echoes now. In life, she says, \"you always have to choose, to decide which path to follow. There is the good and the bad.\"\\n\"As for me,\" she concludes in her poised voice, \"I have always chosen to walk toward the good.\"\\nA list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line\\n'},\n",

He denies criminal liability and is willing to cooperate, his lawyer says.\\nEmails released by the US government are thought to show that Jagland planned solo and family visits to Epstein\\'s homes in Paris, New York and Palm Beach after the billionaire was convicted of a child sex offence.\\nThree of Jagland\\'s properties were searched by Norwegian crime unit Økokrim and he is now expected to be questioned.\\nAs well as serving as prime minister from 1996 to 1997, Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent a decade as secretary general of the Council of Europe.\\nJagland had diplomatic immunity from heading the Council, Europe\\'s watchdog for democracy and human rights, for alleged acts carried out during his 2009 to 2019 tenure.\\nØkokrim requested the Council revoke his immunity after it launched an investigation earlier this month into allegations of gross corruption made against him between 2011 and 2018.\\nThe so-called Epstein files appear to show instances where the late financier covered the travel expenses to his properties for Jagland and his family.\\nThe former leader had planned a family trip to Epstein\\'s private Caribbean island in 2014, but it was ultimately cancelled after Epstein fell ill.\\nJagland also faces allegations that he solicited Epstein\\'s help in obtaining a bank loan in another exchange, although it is not clear whether this materialised, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. Police have not confirmed whether this allegation is part of the gross corruption charge.\\nMention in the Epstein files - which have been released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) - does not indicate any wrongdoing.\\nJagland was seen walking out of his home alongside his lawyer in Oslo on Thursday, one of the properties - alongside two in Risør and Rauland - that Økokrim confirmed it had searched.\\nPoliticians, celebrities and royals have been caught up in the turmoil after the US DOJ published the latest tranche of files last month, containing millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into the late sex offender - who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.\\nThe Nordic country has seen several public figures drawn into the widening scandal, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit, diplomats Mona Juul and Terje Rød-Larsen, and chief executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende.\\nMette-Marit gave a \"profound apology\" to Norwegians for her friendship with Epstein, after it emerged they had exchanged messages for three years.\\nMona Juul and her husband Terje Rød-Larsen are also being investigated by Norway\\'s Økokrim for \"aggravated corruption\" following Norwegian media reports, that each of her children would receive $5m (£3.6m) in a will allegedly signed by Epstein days before he died.\\nJuul\\'s lawyer has said she \"does not recognise the accusations made against her\" and Rød-Larsen\\'s lawyer said he is confident the investigation will clarify \"there is no basis for criminal liability\".\\nThe WEF ordered an independent review into Brende - who also served as the Norwegian foreign minister - over his interactions with the paedophile.\\nBrende has acknowledged dining with Epstein three times in 2018 and 2019 and communicating with him by email and text, but said he was \"completely unaware\" of his past criminal activity.

At the time, Leveugle was living in Morocco.\\nHis brother\\'s son - who had suspicions about his uncle - took advantage of his absence one day in October 2023 to examine a USB drive that belonged to Leveugle. It allegedly contained \"15 tomes of very dense material\" - photographs and written accounts of his \"sexual relations\" with minors, Manteaux said.\\n\"The victims we have spoken to tell us that he spent a lot of time helping them to learn foreign languages, awakening their sense of culture... He has a complex personality,\" the prosecutor said.\\n\"A lot of work has been done to identify all the victims. But in his journal, some only have first names, and there we found ourselves up against a wall. That\\'s why we decided to launch this appeal - and also in case there are other victims not listed in his journal,\" Manteaux added.\\nThe prosecutor revealed that under questioning, Leveugle also allegedly admitted to killing his own mother and aunt by smothering them with cushions.\\nHe is accused of killing his mother in 1974 when she was in the terminal phase of cancer, and he allegedly did the same to his 92-year-old aunt in 1992.\\n\"He explained to us that he told (his aunt) he had to leave for the Cévennes. She was pleading with him not to go, so he took the decision to kill her too,\" the prosecutor said.\\n\"He justifies the killings by saying he hoped someone would do the same to him if he was in the same situation at the end of his life.\"\\nA separate judicial investigation has been opened into these alleged killings.\\nUnder French law, alleged assaults that took place before 1993 come under the country\\'s statute of limitations, so no prosecutions for them would be possible. However Manteaux said it was still important to get a full picture of Leveugle\\'s alleged crimes.\\nIn two other recent and high-profile sexual assault cases in France, offenders kept records of their activities which were later key in bringing them to justice.\\nIn the Pélicot rape case, Dominique Pélicot kept videos of men assaulting his sleeping wife Gisèle, whom he had drugged. He was jailed for 20 years.\\nIn Brittany, former doctor Joêl Le Scouarnec compiled detailed computer records of the hundreds of children he molested in hospital. Without this evidence, he may never have been convicted. He, too, was jailed for 20 years.\\n'},\n",

This is the question in the field of economy and finance, in defence and security, and in our democratic systems.\\n\"In another era we might have said it is the moment to \\'assume our majority\\',\" he said ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later this week.\\nMacron repeated his call for EU-wide mutualised loans in order to raise hundreds of billions of euros needed for industrial investment.\\n\"The time has come to launch a shared debt capacity to fund our future expense - eurobonds for the future. We need big European programmes to finance the best projects,\" he said.\\nSimilar calls in the past have met scepticism from Germany and other countries, who feel France wants to use Europe to bear a financial burden which it alone - because of its failure to reform - is unable to take up.\\nMacron admitted that France \"has never had a balanced model, unlike certain economies of the north, which are built more on a sense of responsibility.\\n\"And we have never had reforms like the ones initiated in the 2010s in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece, which are paying dividends today.\"\\nBut he said there was growing demand in the world\\'s financial markets for mutualised European debt, which currently the EU was not equipped to supply.\\n\"The world markets are increasingly afraid of the American greenback [dollar].

And when I look at the world as it is, we have the authoritarian regime that is China, and on the other side we have the US distancing itself further and further from a state of law.\"\\nAccording to Macron, the 27-member EU needs €1,2tn (£1tn; $1.4tn) a year to invest in the vital sectors of security and defence, clean energy, and artificial intelligence.\\nCalling on the EU to \"protect\" these and other industries, he said: \"The Chinese do it, the Americans too. Europe today is the most open market in the world.\\n\"In the face of that, I am not saying we should be protectionist. It\\'s more a question of being coherent - in other words not imposing on our own producers rules which we do not impose on non-Europeans.\"\\n\"Today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder,\" he said.\\n\"Climate change is accelerating. The US – which we thought would guarantee our security for ever – is no longer sure. Russia was to give us cheap energy for ever, but that stopped three years ago. China... has become a rival that gets fiercer and fiercer.\\n\"Today, we Europeans are on our own. But we have each other. We are 450 million people. It\\'s huge. For me [becoming a power] is the fulfilment of the European adventure.\\n\"We came together to stop war, we came together to build a market. But we always forbade ourselves to think of power.\"\\nAsked about the latest stand-off with Washington over Greenland, at the end of which US President Donald Trump appeared to back down from threats to annex the Danish territory, Macron said the Europeans should not be fooled.\\n\"At the end of a crisis, there is a cowardly tendency to sit back and say \\'phew\\'. There are threats and intimidation, and then suddenly Washington gives way. And people think it\\'s over.\\n\"Don\\'t believe it for a single second,\" the French leader said.\\n'},\n",

We look after the other children as well... They also need to be cared for, and I have to make sure to take care of the crown princess,\" he said.\\nMette-Marit is also extremely unwell with pulmonary fibrosis and her doctors are preparing to put her on a list for a lung transplant.\\nGiving evidence in court on Wednesday, her son initially struggled to compose himself, holding back tears as he complained of being \"hassled\" by the press since he was three years old.\\nIf found guilty by the three judges at Oslo district court, he could face a jail term of at least 10 years. Two days before the trial began, he was arrested for a fourth time on Sunday, on suspicion of assault, wielding a knife and violating a restraining order.\\nHis half-sister Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 22, was also critical of the press in a post to almost 800 followers on a private Instagram account this week.\\nIn lengthy comments seen by public broadcaster NRK, Aftenposten and VG website, the princess, who is second in line to the Norwegian throne after her father, said it was important \"not to make claims you have no basis for\".\\nWhile stressing she was not referring to anything in particular - \"not Marius, not mum or dad or Magnus.

It involved the exchange of 314 prisoners - \"the first such exchange in five months\", he said.\\n\"While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,\" Witkoff added.\\nZelensky confirmed 157 Ukrainians were released, and vowed to continue work so everyone was returned home. Russia\\'s ministry of defence also showed pictures of its soldiers after they had been released by the Ukrainians.\\nAt the end of the talks, the US European Command issued a statement saying the US and Russia had agreed to re-establish high-level military-to-military dialogue, which was suspended in the autumn of 2021.\\n\"This channel will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace,\" the statement said.\\nThe Abu Dhabi talks began as Russia renewed attacks on Ukraine after a week-long pause that Trump had asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.\\nIt has been targeting the country\\'s energy sector, leaving thousands without power and heating as temperatures dropped to -20C (-4F)\".\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The Trump International Hotel proposed for the Serbian capital Belgrade was supposed to mark a new chapter in the country\\'s modern history.\\nIt would take the place of one of the city\\'s most arresting sights: the bomb-damaged, but still semi-functional, remains of the defence ministry complex, or Generalstab (General Staff) as it is otherwise known.\\nOne major obstacle stood in the way: Generalstab was listed as cultural heritage.\\nThe government tried to get around this by removing the complex from the register of protected buildings but now Culture Minister Nikola Selakovic is on trial for abuse of office, accused of using his position to influence or falsify documents to revoke Generalstab\\'s cultural heritage status.\\nProsecutors are calling for a three-year prison sentence, while President Aleksandar Vucic has promised to pardon the minister if judges convict him.\\nWhatever the verdict, it now seems highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to check into a Trump International in Belgrade.\\nThe project always had been a hard sell, given the recent history between the US and Serbia.\\nUS warplanes carried out the Nato air strikes in 1999 which reduced Generalstab to the shattered state in which it has remained.\\nBearing in mind that Washington was also the main sponsor of Kosovo\\'s unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, there is not an abundance of goodwill towards the US among Serbians.\\nSo there was a collective raising of eyebrows in 2024 when Serbia\\'s government struck a deal with the US president\\'s son-in-law Jared Kushner to redevelop Generalstab through his Affinity Global company.\\nSurprise turned to outrage with his announcement last year that a Trump International Hotel would form the centrepiece of the project.\\nVucic insisted the time was right for Serbia to \"overcome the burden from 1999\".\\nHe told the BBC last year that his governing Progressive Party was \"ready to build better relations with the US\", saying: \"I think that is terribly important for this country.\"\\nIt soon became clear that many Serbs did not share that perspective – at least when it came to Generalstab.\\nOpposition to Kushner\\'s project brought together an unlikely coalition of architects, military veterans and student-led anti-corruption protesters.\\nThe architects pointed out that the bombed buildings had been the only project completed in Serbia by the renowned Yugoslav architect Nikola Dorbrovic, while the veterans saw them as a de facto memorial for the people who died in the 1999 air strikes.\\nThe students noted that the deal with Affinity Global had gone through without any tender process.\\nNone of this stopped the government from trying to push through the project. In November, MPs passed special legislation to allow the Trump Hotel to be built.\\nBut prosecutors had also been keeping an eye on the affair, particularly efforts to remove Generalstab from the protected heritage register.\\nThat led to them bringing charges against the culture minister and three other officials in December.\\nSelakovic responded by calling prosecutors an \"organised criminal group\" and an \"autoimmune disease\", accusing them of \"targeting the president\".\\nBut the charges proved one controversy too many for Kushner. His company stated they wanted to \"unite rather than divide\" and their withdrawal was \"out of respect for the citizens of Serbia and the City of Belgrade\".\\nVucic has made no secret of his fury. He has called the prosecution \"shameful and pathetic\" and \"disgusting political manipulation\".\\nLast month, his governing party pushed through amendments to judicial legislation, despite critics\\' warnings that this would reduce the independence of prosecutors and judges.\\nThe EU\\'s enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, described the laws as a \"serious step backwards\", saying they had been \"adopted in a very fast and non-transparent procedure, without any consultations\".\\nProtesters have been back on the streets of Belgrade, this time outside the court where the minister is on trial. They held a banner reading \"we are all witnesses\".\\nAs for Kushner, his focus has switched to Albania, where he plans to build a luxury resort on Sazan Island. The country\\'s Prime Minister Edi Rama says he is \"proud and happy\".\\nIt is not yet clear whether a Trump International Hotel is in the offing.\\n'},\n",

In his testimony, he admitted filming a five-minute video of the woman in his family\\'s basement, although he did not remember doing so.\\nWhen pressed by the prosecutor how he could be sure she was awake in the video, he appeared to become frustrated, saying he had said \"a million times\" he did not remember the sequence of events.\\nThe woman\\'s attorney, Heidi Reisvang, told the BBC that it had been extremely hard for her client to give evidence over two days and she was relieved it was over: \"The most important thing for her was to say she was not able to resist or give consent.\"\\nMarius Borg Høiby also took aim at the Norwegian press, accusing them of twisting the facts, disputing a story that his mother had taken a sim-card out of his phone before it was handed to police at the time of his arrest in August 2024.\\nHe is due to continue giving evidence on Thursday.\\n'},\n",

The message was that this caused the deaths and the injuries of 24 others who were trying to reach European soil.\\nBut experience tells us to be wary of such instant and unequivocal explanations.\\nIn the summer of 2023, I arrived in the southern Greek port city of Kalamata on the day more than 650 migrants were feared to have drowned.\\nAlready, an official Greek narrative had been established that this was a tragedy caused by criminal gangs cramming too many people into an unseaworthy fishing boat.\\nWe were told there was nothing that could have been done to save those onboard, including the estimated 100 women and children who were travelling in the hold of the Adriana.\\nBut survivors then told the BBC that coastguards had caused the migrant boat to capsize following a botched attempt to tow it.\\nAs we returned to Greece to investigate over the following months, more and more contradictions appeared in the official account.\\nNearly three years on, four senior figures in the Greek coastguard, including its current commander, are among 21 officers now facing criminal prosecution for negligent manslaughter over what was the worst loss of life in the Mediterranean Sea for a decade.\\nIt is far too early to draw confident comparisons between 2023 and this latest case, but it may be useful to point out what has happened before where the coastguard has been present when migrants have died at sea.\\nAs for Tuesday\\'s fatal incident, near Chios, much of the Greek media has been amplifying the story that the migrant speedboat was manoeuvring dangerously and would not stop.\\nThere has so far been no testimony from the survivors to back up or question that account.\\nThere is also a lack of independent, third-party evidence that may support the scenario where the packed migrants boat had deliberately hit the specialist military speedboat.\\nAny video of the supposed collision could be hugely significant.\\nBut it is not clear whether the coastguard was recording its interaction with the migrant boat.\\nIn the case of the Adriana disaster in 2023, the patrol ship involved had been equipped with state-of-the-art, EU-funded, cameras.\\nThey had been deactivated.\\nMobile phone footage - taken by their coastguards or the migrants during this latest fatal crossing - could also be pivotal.\\nAgain, we do not know what has happened to the phones owned by those involved on Tuesday night.\\nBut we do know that in the 2023 case 20 mobiles belonging to migrants went missing for 25 days.\\nThey were eventually discovered on the island of Kythira, 60 nautical miles from Kalamata, after being left in a bag on a coastguard vessel, so said officials.\\nFollowing previous migrant crossings, Greek authorities have often confiscated communication equipment of those detained for making illegal crossings, while they investigate who - if anyone - had been a smuggler, not merely a paying passenger.\\nGreece remains a key route for people from the Middle East and elsewhere wanting to reach the European Union.\\nThe UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, says 41,696 people arrived in Greece by sea in 2025.\\nThat is a fall from 54,417 in 2024.\\nLast year 107 people were reported dead or missing attempting the crossing to the Greek mainland and islands.\\nSince 2019, the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has pursued a much tougher approach against illegal migration.\\nThis has proved to be popular among many voters and was an important issue during the last general election, in 2023, which Mitsotakis\\'s party won.\\nHowever, human rights groups have consistently accused the Greek coastguard of pursuing dangerous and illegal policies at sea.\\nThe Greek government and the coastguard deny these accusations, saying its officers act within the law and have saved hundreds of migrants\\' lives at sea over the past decade.\\nBut the EU border agency said last year that it was reviewing 12 cases of potential human rights violations by Greece, including some allegations that migrants seeking asylum were pushed back from Greece\\'s frontiers.\\n\\nFollowing the latest fatal crossing, opposition politicians have quickly condemned the Greek coastguard.\\nGabriel Sakellaridis, a senior figure in the left-wing Nea Aristera party, posted on social media: \"Another Coast Guard deterrence operation, with specific political instructions from the government, which in the name of the \\'tough\\' anti-immigration policy has turned Greek waters into a cemetery.\"\\nIn the Greek parliament on Wednesday, Immigration Minister Thanos Plevris said he trusted the account of the coastguards who were operating off Chios on Tuesday night.\\nHe said they should be praised, in contrast to human rights activists who complained but saved no-one.\\nMany details about this latest incident are still unknown.\\nHistory suggests we may never know what really happened this time in the darkness of the Mediterranean Sea.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The first woman to give evidence in the trial of Marius Borg Høiby, son of Norway\\'s crown princess, has told of her sense of \"betrayal and shock\" after she was shown videos by police allegedly of him sexually assaulting her years earlier.\\nThe woman told the court behind closed doors on Tuesday she had no recollection of what happened after brief, consensual sex at an \"after-party\" at his parents\\' house outside Oslo. Giving evidence on Wednesday she said she suspected she had been drugged.\\nThe defendant, 29, is due to take the stand later for the first time.\\nHe denies four counts of rape but admits some of the 34 other charges against him. He has not been accused of drugging anyone.\\nHe has admitted to transporting drugs and speeding.\\nAppearing in court for the first time on Tuesday, he was seen shaking, and he is understood have had hospital treatment overnight, rather than returning to custody after he was arrested by police for an alleged assault on Sunday.\\nHis trial coincides with a tense moment for his mother, after she was found to have exchanged hundreds of messages with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein over a three-year period.\\nThe palace said on Wednesday that Crown Princess Mette-Marit had postponed a private trip \"until further notice\", without giving further details. However, the storm of criticism over the unguarded, warm tone of the exchanges has heaped pressure on the royal house, when Mette-Marit is also seeing her son on trial for rape. She has expressed regret and poor judgement over the correspondence.\\nShe was a commoner when she married Crown Prince Haakon, and her son was already four years old. He is not a member of the royal family or a public figure but has grown up as part of the extended family. No member of his family will be attending the trial.\\nAfter his initial arrest in August 2024, Marius Borg Høiby spoke of years of mental health issues and of struggles with substance abuse.\\nWednesday\\'s first session in court took place behind closed doors, but a small number of journalists were allowed to follow proceedings from an adjoining room.\\nHowever, they had not been allowed on Tuesday to see the videos and images taken from Marius Borg Høiby\\'s phone which police said showed the first witness being sexually assaulted while incapacitated at his parents\\' Skaugum estate in December 2018.\\nOn Wednesday, the court was then shown videos of her reaction to the images during questioning by police years later.\\nAsked by the prosecution whether she had been awake or asleep, she told the court that she appeared to be \"completely unconscious - it doesn\\'t even look like I\\'m breathing\". She said she suspected she had swallowed something without being aware of it.\\nAsked whether she thought she had been drugged, she replied: \"That\\'s what I think.\"\\nAll four of the women alleged to have been raped were either asleep or otherwise incapacitated at the time of the alleged rapes, which all took place after consensual sex.\\nHeavy court restrictions have been imposed on the trial, with a ban on photos of the defendant or the women he is alleged to have raped inside or outside court.\\nProsecutor Sturla Henriksbø said on Tuesday he would be treated no differently than any other Norwegian. But defence counsel Ellen Holager Andenæs said he had already been subjected to prejudicial treatment from the media.\\nIt would be strange, she said, if someone facing such a \"tsunami of negative publicity over such a long time\" did not feel they were losing control of their life and destiny.\\nSpeaking on Tuesday, the first witness said the situation was surreal and overwhelming, and that it was unfair she was being dragged into the criminal case. The alleged events took place in 2018 and it was not until after the defendant\\'s arrest in 2024 that police found videos on his phone.\\nShe told the court that they had had consensual sex for a few seconds before she put an end to it. Then she said there was a \"big black hole\" in her memory. Asked if she had fallen asleep afterwards, she was adamant that she had not.\\nMarius Borg Høiby\\'s defence counsel told the court on Tuesday that he had pleaded not guilty to rape because he saw all the incidents as \"completely normal and voluntary sexual relations\".\\nShe said the court would need to decide whether the four women had been unable to prevent what had happened, and if he should have understood that they were asleep or unable to resist.\\nThe case will be decided by three judges - if they find him guilty, he could go to jail for at least 10 years.\\nMeanwhile, there are signs of disquiet among Norwegians from snap polls this week.\\nOne survey by the Verdens Gang website suggested that its popularity was down to 60.9%. The same poll also suggested 44% of Norwegians believed Mette-Marit should not become queen.\\nThe palace sees opinion polls as snapshots that change over time, and it will have been comforted by a vote by Norwegian MPs as the trial got under way.\\nTraditionally, they vote once in every parliament on a republican motion to abolish the monarchy and the motion came up by coincidence on Tuesday. The result was never in doubt - and only 26 of the 169 members of the Storting supported abolition.\\n'},\n",

Reddit is challenging Australia\\'s ban in the High Court.\\n\"Today, our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone,\" Sánchez said, describing social media as a place of \"addiction, abuse, pornography, manipulation [and] violence.\\n\"We will no longer accept that. We will protect them.\"\\nSánchez first mooted a possible ban in November, but on Tuesday, the plan was fleshed out.\\nUnder the changes, social media platforms would be required to have effective age verification systems, \"not just check boxes, but real barriers that work,\" the prime minister explained, in a possible reference to the loopholes Australian children use to bypass checks - including simply using a photo of an adult.\\nThe new laws would also criminalise manipulating algorithms to amplify illegal content.\\n\"This is something created, promoted, and disseminated by certain actors whom we will investigate, as well as the platforms whose algorithms amplify disinformation in exchange for profit,\" Sánchez said.\\n\"Hiding behind code and claiming that technology is neutral is no longer acceptable.\"\\nThere would also be a new system designed to track \"how digital platforms fuel division and amplify hate\". No further details were given on how this would work.\\nAnother measure, Sánchez said, would be to \"investigate and prosecute the crimes committed by Grok [X\\'s AI tool], TikTok, and Instagram\".\\nThe European Commission has launched an investigation into Grok over concerns it was used to create sexualised images of real people.\\nThe UK has announced its own investigation into Grok and on Tuesday in France, the offices of X were raided by the Paris prosecutor\\'s cyber-crime unit as it looked into allegations of offences including unlawful data extraction and complicity in the possession of child pornography.\\nX is yet to respond to either investigation - the BBC has approached it for comment. It has previously characterised the French investigation as an attack on free speech.\\nSánchez said he hoped to get the laws passed next week, but that could prove difficult because his left-wing coalition government lacks a parliamentary majority.\\nSpain\\'s main opposition party, the conservative People\\'s Party, seems to approve of the ban, saying it has previously proposed similar restrictions. The far-right Vox party has spoken out against it, however.\\nIn response to the announcement, X owner Elon Musk labelled Sánchez as a \"tyrant and traitor to the people of Spain\".\\nTikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Reddit, Discord and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram have all been approached for comment.\\nFrance has led the charge in Europe, with President Emmanuel Macron saying he wants a ban for under-15s in place by the start of the next school year in September.\\n'},\n",

The court also heard evidence from a woman he is alleged to have raped in 2018.\\nHe is not a member of the royal family himself. His lawyer said he was a young man who deserved a fair trial and condemned press treatment of him.\\nThe trial comes against a backdrop of almost daily revelations surrounding him and his mother, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, who is facing increasing criticism after it emerged she was cited in hundreds of emails showing extensive contacts with late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\\n\\nMette-Marit, who married the crown prince when her son was four, has admitted showing \"poor judgement\", but the fallout has already begun, with one organisation dropping her as patron for its annual prize.\\nOn the first day of the seven-week trial which began in courtroom 250 at Oslo district court, her son wore an ordinary sweater, white T-shirt and olive-green trousers, his blond hair cut short. He later removed the sweater and sat in court in a simple T-shirt.\\n\\nHeavy court restrictions have been imposed on the trial, with a ban on any photos of the defendant inside or outside court.\\nAs the charges were read out, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the four accusations of rape, speaking very quietly. At times he fiddled with a bracelet as public prosecutor Sturla Henriksbø detailed the charges against him.\\nHøiby partially admitted charges relating to a woman in Frogner in western Oslo in August 2024, admitting bodily harm but denying abuse. He admitted to several other allegations, including violating a restraining order, transporting marijuana and speeding.\\nSitting opposite, to the right of the prosecutor, were some of the women named as victims in the case. The court has banned any detail that might identify the four women involved - a point underlined by the judge as proceedings opened.\\nThe prosecutor set out details of the rape charges, alleging that the first took place during an after-party in December 2018 in the basement of the defendant\\'s parents\\' house when he was 21.\\nThe woman involved gave evidence at the end of the day during a closed session, which some journalists were allowed to follow from another room.\\nShe said that they had sex for a few seconds before she stopped it. She remembered nothing of what happened next, calling it a \"big black hole\". Police later found videos on the defendant\\'s phone, allegedly showing her being sexually assaulted without intercourse, which counts as rape in Norway.\\nAll four instances of rape are alleged to have taken place after consensual sex, when the women were either asleep or incapacitated. One charge involved intercourse, the other three involve sexual assault.\\nDefence counsel Ellen Holager Andenæs said Marius Borg Høiby should be treated as innocent unless proven otherwise, and said it would be strange if someone facing such a \"tsunami of negative publicity over such a long time\" did not feel they were losing control of their life and destiny.\\nOn the eve of the trial it emerged he had been detained for a fourth time, in circumstances not unlike his initial arrest, on suspicion of assault, making threats with a knife and violating a restraining order.\\nAs police have placed him on remand for four weeks, he began the trial in custody.\\nHis defence team intends to appeal against the decision.\\nThe royal family will not attend the trial, although that is not seen as surprising by Norwegians.\\nMarius Borg Høiby was born four years before Mette-Marit married the crown prince, and although he is seen as a close member of the family he is not part of the royal family itself and not a public figure.\\nHe faces an array of 38 charges:\\nrape with sexual intercourse while a woman was unconscious in October 2023\\nthree counts of rape by sexual assault on incapacitated women - considered rape in Norway - in December 2018, March 2024 and November 2024\\nsix counts of sexually offensive conduct without consent - including filming of victims\\ncausing bodily harm\\nrepeatedly abusing a current or ex-partner through threats, coercion or violence\\nviolating a restraining order against him\\ntransporting 3.5kg of marijuana\\nspeeding\\nSome of the charges involving abuse and threats in August 2024 relate to the so-called \"Frogner woman\", and it is understood that his latest arrest is linked to her too.\\nHe is expected to give evidence for the first time on Wednesday. The case will be decided by three judges - if they find him guilty he could go to jail for at least 10 years.\\nHis mother suffers from a serious lung condition and has difficulty breathing. But it is not her health that has become the talk of Norway in recent days, rather her name cited in more than 900 emails published by the US Department of Justice late last week.\\nThe tone suggests a future queen of Norway exchanging messages with her guard down, even though she knows she is talking to a registered sex offender who had spent time in jail. It has also emerged she spent four days at his home in Florida when he was not present.\\nThe Sex and Society foundation, which focuses on sexual and reproductive rights, has said it no longer wants Mette-Marit to act as high patron for its annual Shameless Prize, because what had emerged was incompatible with what it stood for.\\nThe crown princess is Norway\\'s future queen, and the decision will come as a blow to her reputation.\\nPrime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre urged Mette-Marit to \"explain the extent of the contacts that have taken place\".\\nNorway\\'s royal family remains very popular, with a Norstat opinion poll not long ago suggesting 73% were in favour of it.\\nHowever, the leader of Norway\\'s Green Party, Arild Hermstad, who is a republican says the email exchanges point to a monarchy that is not working.\\nBy coincidence, Norwegian MPs voted on Tuesday to reject a motion to abolish the monarchy that republicans submit by tradition every few years, a decision that was widely expected.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'After US President Donald Trump oversaw the seizure of his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro last month, he vowed to tap the country\\'s oil reserves – the world\\'s largest.\\nTrump now says that he plans to visit the South American country, although no date has been set.\\nHis comments, made last Friday, came after US Energy Secretary Chris Wright completed a two-day trip to Venezuela to see how the nation is starting to reopen its oil sector to US companies.\\nWright\\'s visit came shortly after Venezuela\\'s National Assembly passed a law to allow both private and foreign investment in its oil industry, following two decades of tight state control.\\nIn Trump\\'s eyes it is a big business opportunity for the US oil sector. \"We\\'re going to be extracting numbers in terms of oil like few people have seen,\" he said at a news conference in mid-January, after a meeting with energy bosses at the White House.\\nBut for the US oil firms that Trump wants to invest heavily in Venezuela, the question is a simple one - do the numbers add up?\\nWilliam Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, says the US president\\'s aim is to \"revive Venezuela\\'s oil sector and use that energy to increase supply and reduce costs to the consumer, possibly providing a source of revenue for a more friendly Venezuelan government to rebuild the economy after years of mismanagement\".\\nFor US energy companies, however, there are huge practical difficulties to be overcome. Venezuela\\'s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, is a shadow of its former self.\\nThe governments of Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez milked the firm for all it was worth, and used the money to finance social spending on housing, healthcare and transport.\\nBut they failed to invest in maintaining oil production levels, which have plummeted in recent years – partly, but not solely, because of US sanctions, which could now be revised.\\n\"In Venezuela, you\\'re dealing with equipment that\\'s been degraded by many years of neglect,\" says Jackson. \"Ten to 15 years ago, Venezuela was producing 1.5 million barrels a day more than it does today.\"\\nMonica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, agrees that PDVSA is in a parlous state.\\n\"A lot of things have to be scrapped completely and rebuilt from the ground up,\" she tells the BBC. \"In fact, if political constraints did not matter, the best thing to do would be to scrap PDVSA, but that isn\\'t going to happen.\\n\"It\\'s a big nationalist symbol, it\\'s attached to sovereignty. Would the Venezuelans be willing to do whatever the US says and roll over? I don\\'t think so.\"\\nTrump has asked US oil firms to spend at least $100bn (£75bn) on restoring Venezuela\\'s battered infrastructure – an absolute necessity before his plan to ramp up sales can be realised.\\nOfficially, Venezuela has 300 billion barrels of oil reserves – yet in 2023, it exported just 211.6 million barrels of oil, worth about $4bn. Compare that to second-placed Saudi Arabia, which has 267 billion barrels of reserves, but had exports worth $181bn in the same time period.\\nSo on paper at least, there is room for improvement. However, Jackson says there are doubts over the true size of Venezuela\\'s oil reserves.\\nDuring the Chávez presidency, Venezuela reclassified its reserves. Previously, there were thought to be just 80 billion barrels of extractable oil, but by 2011, its reported figure had nearly quadrupled. That statistical change was made possible by high oil prices at the time, which allowed previously unviable projects to look feasible.\\n\"There was a big step – jump – that people have questioned,\" Jackson says. \"But now the world is awash with oil and it\\'s not clear that the same calculations still apply.\"\\nWhen Chávez became Venezuela\\'s president in 1999, oil prices were climbing. In the early 2010s, a barrel would often fetch about $100, providing the government with plenty of money to pour into social programmes. But with current prices around the $65 mark, the country looks less like a reasonable investment.\\nVenezuela\\'s oil is also of poorer quality than its Saudi equivalent. Its sour, heavy crude is difficult to extract and refine, while its high sulphur content makes it corrosive to pipelines. A resurgence of Venezuela\\'s industry could pose problems for Canada, which produces similarly viscous oil and exports much of it to the US, but analysts reckon the risk is minor.\\nAccording to research by Capital Economics, Canadian oil should remain competitively priced, even if Venezuelan production increases.\\nIn the meantime, Venezuela\\'s economic crisis has led to the exodus of nearly eight million people who have fled in search of a better life.\\nThis includes expertise vital to keeping the oil pumps working: with the skilled engineers formerly on the PDVSA payroll now plying their trade elsewhere, the system limps on with a skeleton staff.\\nThomas Watters, managing director and sector lead for oil and gas at research firm S&P Global Ratings, says US firms have the ability to repair Venezuela\\'s infrastructure, but it has to make economic sense.\\n\"At the end of the day, oil and gas companies have to deliver value to shareholders,\" he says. \"They have very good managers. You can build anything, as long as you can pay for it.\\n\"But you need an oil price that makes that worthwhile. Unless you can generate sufficient money to justify that, it\\'s very difficult to see the industry coming back.\"\\nBesides, US oil firms have been bitten by Venezuela once before. In 2007, major US companies including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips had their assets seized when they refused to allow PDVSA to take majority control.\\nThey went to the international courts and were awarded huge sums in damages – $8.3bn in the case of ConocoPhillips – which have never been paid.\\nGiven that the current Venezuelan regime continues largely intact, with former Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez as interim leader, it will take a lot to dispel fears of renewed expropriation.\\nMoreover, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said the Trump administration has no plans to offer security guarantees to oil companies in Venezuela – a worrying omission in a country where state-sanctioned paramilitary groups known as \"colectivos\" often operate as criminal gangs.\\nWithout bigger government incentives, oil firms will be reluctant to take what could be an expensive plunge. Small wonder, then, that ExxonMobil boss Darren Woods has called Venezuela \"uninvestable\" in its current state.\\nTellingly, Trump did not come back with an offer of sweeteners to promote investment. Instead, he threatened to block ExxonMobil investment in Venezuela.\\nThe policy is \"all stick, no carrot\", says de Bolle of the Peterson Institute. \"And it doesn\\'t seem like they understand that they do need carrots.\"\\nIn de Bolle\\'s view, the Trump administration has an \"imperialist vision\" of Latin America that leads it to see the region\\'s resources as its property. For her, private oil firms\\' aversion to Venezuela is a welcome barrier to that kind of resource grab.\\n\"This is a time when you think, \\'Thank God the US doesn\\'t have a state-owned oil company,\\'\" she says. \"They need the private sector, but for the moment, the private sector isn\\'t budging. And what company in their right mind is going to put money into Venezuela?\"\\nBut if Venezuela\\'s oil output does eventually surge, could it bring global oil prices down? Analysts refuse to be drawn.\\n\"It depends on the scale at which it happens,\" says Jackson of Capital Economics.\\n\"The situation is very fluid, very opaque, and there\\'s a big geopolitical angle. We\\'re in the early stages where Venezuelan production is concerned.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'It was the last hour of the last day of Peter Smith\\'s holiday in Tobago when he decided to take a dip in the sea.\\n\"The conditions were perfect for a swim,\" the retired IT director recalls. \"I dived into the waves, swam out no more than 20 feet (6m), and stood waist-deep in the water.\"\\nHe and his wife Joanna, from Hertfordshire, were away with friends, and the last thing on their minds was the risk of shark attacks - they are unheard of on this tiny Caribbean island.\\n\"Suddenly I felt a very heavy object hit my leg. I look down and there\\'s a shark - and it\\'s big,\" Peter says.\\n\"You\\'re talking maybe 10 foot (3m). That\\'s when your brain works at 1,000 miles an hour.\"\\nHe had been bitten by a bull shark, one of the most dangerous sharks in the world and notorious for hunting in shallow waters.\\nIn his first interview since the attack in April 2024, Peter tells BBC News about his terrifying experience - and why he\\'s still not scared of sharks.\\nThe 66-year-old says he instantly recognised the jaws clenching onto his leg as those of a bull shark. Fearing he would be dragged underwater, he decided to put up a fight.\\n\"I start punching the shark. To be honest I don\\'t know what I was trying to do, but I was hitting it,\" Peter says. \"I can honestly say I\\'ve never hit anything as hard as I hit that shark.\\n\"After hitting my leg, it managed to attack my left arm and then my stomach. The situation got serious really fast. I lost a lot of blood.\"\\nFinally, the animal stopped its attack long enough for Peter to be dragged from the water by people nearby.\\nHis friends John and Moira, who were beside him in the sea, each helped fight the shark and raise the alarm. Back on the beach, Joanna, alerted by Moira\\'s screams, ran to the shoreline.\\n\"I remember going into the water and seeing his terrible injuries. I could see bones, it was just awful,\" Joanna recalls. \"And somebody said, \\'Get her away from here.\\'\"\\nPeter was taken to the only hospital on Tobago with deep lacerations to his stomach, a large bite on one arm and a huge part of his upper thigh bitten off.\\nHe describes the pain kicking in as he was being put in the ambulance. \"I\\'m screaming, I\\'m crying, losing a lot of blood and losing consciousness. People are screaming at me to stay awake.\"\\nJoanna, 64, a retired NHS worker, says she didn\\'t know whether her husband would make it out of the ambulance alive: \"He was so pale, it was really scary.\"\\nShe remembers how the Tobagan doctors asked if she could sign a form for her husband\\'s limbs to be removed if necessary - then doctors realised he should be taken off the island. \"They\\'d run out of blood…he\\'d taken all the blood in Tobago,\" Joanna says.\\nHe was taken to the Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, for specialist treatment. Over the next few weeks, he underwent dozens of operations - including one where medics told him they would put a special membrane over a wound to give a better surface for a skin graft.\\n\"Then they laughed. So we were saying, \\'Well, what\\'s funny?\\' And they said, \\'the membrane is made from shark\\'.\" Peter laughs. \"So I have a piece of shark in my leg.\"\\nSo began the long road to recovery. His upper thigh injury meant he had to learn to walk again and issues with the nerve in his arm, severed by the shark\\'s bite, means he still has no feeling in his fingers and difficulty gripping – issues he will have for life.\\n\"I\\'m really grateful. At least I have mobility issues. At least I have limbs,\" he reflects. \"At one stage it looked like I wasn\\'t going to have any.\"\\nNot only is he thankful to his doctors, but his friends who came to help him during the attack, too. \"I fought it along with other people who were really brave. I\\'m forever grateful to them.\"\\nThe bull shark has been linked to several recent attacks in Australia. At the end of January, the country saw four shark attacks in just 48 hours, one resulting in the death of a 12-year-old boy. Three of the attacks were within a nine mile (15km) stretch of each other on the east coast.\\nIt\\'s led experts to caution that shark attacks are still very rare relative to the higher rates of people using the water for leisure - and urge the public to remember the ocean is a wild space with risks.\\nAccording to the world-renowned International Shark Attack File, the 2024 attack on Peter was the first and only shark attack ever recorded in Tobago.\\nShark expert Tom \\'The Blowfish\\' Hird explains that bull sharks have \"certainly got a fire inside them\" and \"are known to retaliate when they have been either chased by boats or when they\\'ve been tagged\".\\nBut he says the fact that fatalities from shark bites are rare shows humans aren\\'t necessarily on the menu. \"Let\\'s be very crystal clear here: if a bull shark, or a tiger, or a great white did want to prey on a human, there would be no body.\"\\nThe demonisation of sharks is unfair, Hird believes, and he says most sharks realise quickly that humans often fight back, and aren\\'t good to eat.\\nPeter doesn\\'t want what happened to him to tarnish the reputation of the Tobago and feels he has no cause to be scared.\\n\"The people in Tobago were really good to me. They depend on tourism for their livelihood. I\\'d go back,\" he insists. \"I still think of the sky and the sea.\\n\"What\\'s the point in surviving a shark attack if you\\'re going to live the rest of your life in fear?\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The Black Hawk helicopter was ready for take off – its rotor blades slicing through the air in the deadening heat of the Colombian Amazon. We ducked low and crammed in alongside the Jungle Commandos – a police special operations unit armed by the Americans and originally trained by Britain\\'s SAS, when it was founded in 1989.\\nThe commandos were heavily armed. The mission was familiar. The weather was clear. But there was tension on board, kicking in with the adrenaline. When you go after any part of the drug trade in Colombia, you have to be ready for trouble.\\nThe commandos often face resistance from criminal groups, and current and former guerrillas who have replaced the cartels of the 1970s and 80s.\\nWe took off, flying over the district of Putumayo - close to the border with Ecuador - part of Colombia\\'s cocaine heartland. The country provides about 70% of the world\\'s supply.\\nJust ahead two other Black Hawks were leading the way.\\nDown below us there was dense forest and patches of bright green – the tell-tale sign of coca plant cultivation. The crop now covers an area nearly twice the size of Greater London, and four times the size of New York, according to the latest figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), published in 2024.\\nPresident Donald Trump says Colombia\\'s left-wing President Gustavo Petro is not doing enough to prevent cocaine from his country winding up on America\\'s streets. Last month he called him \"a sick man who likes selling cocaine to the United States\" and said \"he could be next\" for US military intervention. But that threat appears to have receded.\\nPresident Petro counters that his government has seized the largest amount of drugs in history. But on his watch cocaine production has also soared to record highs, according to the United Nations \\'World Drug Report 2025. Petro disputes the UN\\'s method of counting.\\nThe fight against drug production and trafficking from Colombia will be high on the agenda when the two presidents meet in the White House on Tuesday.\\nAfter 20 minutes, we land at a clearing in the jungle and see the first stage of a global drug trade. The commandos lead us to a crude cocaine lab, partly hidden by banana trees. It\\'s little more than a shack but it has the key ingredients – drums of chemicals and a mound of fresh coca leaves, ready to be turned into a paste.\\nTwo women and a man emerge from the trees, probably workers at the lab – willing or unwilling. One of the women is in torn clothing and all wear wellington boots. The commandos question them briefly but make no arrests. Colombia\\'s anti -narcotics strategy targets those at the top of the cocaine trade, not the dirt-poor farmers at the bottom.\\nMinutes later we are rushed away as the commandos prepare to set the lab alight – destroying the crop, and the chemicals.\\n\"There are 50 or 60 more labs in this area,\" says one officer, who does not want to be named.\\nDense black smoke rises from the forest as we take off. An energy drink is handed around among the commandos, who could soon be doing this all over again. Weather permitting, it\\'s rinse and repeat. They carry out these operations several times a day.\\nBack at base, Major Cristhian Cedano Díaz takes a few moments to unwind with his men. He\\'s a 16-year veteran of the war on drugs, standing ram rod straight, with a handgun in a holster around his neck - and with no illusions.\\nWhen asked how quickly a drug lab can be rebuilt, his response is immediate.\\n\"In one day,\" he says, with a rueful smile. \"It\\'s just a matter of changing or moving a few metres. We have seen it before. Sometimes, when we return to areas where operations have taken place, we find structures have been rebuilt just a few metres away. \"\\nBut he insists that destroying one lab after another serves a purpose.\\n\"We are affecting the profitability of the criminal groups,\" he says. \"They can rebuild countless times, but they are losing the coca crop, and the chemical precursors they need.\"\\nHis enemy is evolving. Colombia\\'s drug gangs use drones and bitcoin and bring chemists into the jungle to create ingredients on site. Major Cedano Díaz, 37, admits the cocaine war may not be over his lifetime.\\n\"I dream of the day [when that happens],\" he says. \"I imagine our descendants see it and will remember those we lost to achieve that goal.\"\\nHis losses include several colleagues of different ranks, in different parts of the country.\\n\"Sadly, we had to bring flags to their families, and say they were no longer with us,\" he says. \"I remember them with pride for continuing to fight in a never-ending battle.\"\\nUnder attack from Donald Trump for not doing enough, Colombia\\'s Defence Minister Pedro Sanchez has defended his country\\'s record, politely.\\n\"The president has been misinformed,\" he told us. \"We destroy cocaine factories every forty minutes. And over the past three and half years we have seized 2,800 tonnes of cocaine. That amounts to 47 billion doses of cocaine that never reached foreign markets.\"\\nHe argues that the demand for cocaine is also a problem, not just the supply. \"With cocaine use rising in Europe, it\\'s very difficult to eradicate the supply here,\" he says.\\nCocaine is the second most commonly used illicit drug in Europe – after cannabis – according to the European Union Drugs Agency. It says the availability and use of the of the drug continue to increase, \"resulting in greater costs to society\".\\nWe followed the cocaine trail from the Amazon to the Colombian Andes, bordering Venezuela. Here the peaks extend into the clouds, and the beauty is matched by the hardship.\\nWe changed vehicles – to a car owned by a trusted local contact - before beginning the step climb up the mountains in Catatumbo. You don\\'t come here unannounced.\\nThere are two guerrilla groups in this area – the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), most of whose members demobilised after a peace deal in 2016 ending half a century of civil war.\\nWe met a local farmer – we are calling him \"Javier\" – who insisted that growing the coca plant was the only way to feed his family.\\nHe showed us his latest crop, some of it shoulder high. When we wanted to get some footage with a drone he warned us to stay low. \"Otherwise, guerrillas will see it,\" he said.\\nHome for Javier is a bare breeze block house, with no glass in some of the windows, and the sound of children\\'s laughter coming from inside. He has five daughters - \"the most beautiful thing God has given me\", he says. His eldest is in college, studying to be a teacher.\\nHis two youngest girls play, in a discarded bookcase – the nearest they have to a dolls house. Javier speaks with regret about not being able to buy his daughters presents at Christmas, and about his struggle to feed them.\\nI point out his crop could kill someone else\\'s children. Does he ever think about that, I ask.\\n\"The truth is yes,\" he says. \"Sometimes you do think about that.\\n\"But if you want to survive, you don\\'t. There are no opportunities with this government. I have children, and of course I think about other children who could be harmed. It\\'s not about whether you want to [grow coca] or not. You have to.\"\\nHe shows us his makeshift lab, down a muddy track. He cooks up cocaine paste here, when he has the chemicals and the fuels.\\nBut these days he says the local guerrillas aren\\'t buying because of a turf war. When he risked a journey to a local town to make a sale he was robbed of his crop and his phone.\\nJavier is thinking of going back to his old job – coal mining – for economic reasons rather than moral ones. But he says the mines have also been hit hard by the government. \"Insurance went up,\" he tells us, \"so wages went down.\"\\nHe\\'s had no trouble with the authorities, so far. \"I believe they know what\\'s happening here,\" he tells us, \"but the truth is they don\\'t come around – maybe because of the armed groups.\"\\nHe has a plea for President Trump: instead of threatening Colombia, consider why farmers like him grow the coca plant, and send economic help.\\nJavier is 39 – just two years older than Major Cedano Díaz. Both men are on opposite sides of this country\\'s drug war, and both are hoping their children will inherit a different Colombia.\\nAdditional reporting by Wietske Burema, Goktay Koraltan, Jhon Jairo Jácome, Lina María Sandoval\\n'},\n",

It was a symbol of national prosperity.\\nThis used to be one of the world\\'s most productive oil basins, and along with the city of Maracaibo, across the lake, is seen as key to President Donald Trump\\'s plan to get US firms to invest $100bn (£75bn) to rebuild Venezuela\\'s energy industry.

While a handful have been freshly painted in the yellow, blue and red of the national flag and remain operational, many others have not moved in years and are rusting and falling apart.\\nThe decay is striking in the 20 or so American-style \"oil camps\" on the fringes of the lake - these were originally built by international companies to house their workforce, after the commercial exploitation of Venezuela\\'s oil reserves took off in the 1920s.\\nOil giants such as Standard Oil of New Jersey (which later became Exxon), Chevron and Shell invested heavily in Maracaibo, Venezuela\\'s second-largest city.

I used to live here with nine relatives, and they all left,\" says 64-year-old José Gregorio Martínez, the son of a former oil worker, sitting on his front porch.\\nFighting back tears, the retired teacher explains that he only survives thanks to the money his relatives send from abroad. His monthly state pension of $2.80 (£2) does not even cover his most basic needs.\\nGil and Martínez recall what they see as the golden days, and are not alone in hoping that new investment from US companies will transform their lives.\\nIn the 1970s, Venezuela pumped as much as 3.5 million barrels of oil per day - accounting for more than 7% of total global output.\\nThen, production was managed by a network of foreign firms, many from the US, operating under government concessions, until the industry was nationalised in 1976 and taken over by the state-owned giant, PDVSA.\\nThe industry continued to form the backbone of the country\\'s economy, benefiting from the high oil prices of the 1970s. When oil prices fell in the 1980s and Venezuela ran into an economic crisis, reality hit. There were protests as the government introduced austerity measures to try to balance the books.\\nIn the 1990s, reforms were introduced to open doors to foreign investment and in 1999 the country still produced about 3.2 million barrels of oil per day, with approximately half of that output coming from Zulia state, the region around Lake Maracaibo.\\nThen came the rise of Chavismo - an anti-American, nationalist ideology created by Maduro\\'s predecessor Hugo Chávez.\\nHe became president in 1999 as oil prices were on the rise again, enabling his government to fund huge social programmes designed to lift millions out of poverty.\\nBut by the end of 2025, oil output had fallen to about 860,000 barrels per day, less than 1% of global crude production.\\nMany cite 2002 as a turning point for the industry, when a strike by oil workers against Chávez\\'s government was followed by a sweeping overhaul of PDVSA. It is widely reported that up to 22,000 people were fired.\\n\"You can\\'t lose 22,000 technical people in a company and expect that nothing happens,\" says Jorge, not his real name, who was dismissed at the time. He says the shake-up aimed to align the company with political priorities and that much of the experienced management resisted, ultimately losing their jobs.\\nIn 2007, the oil sector was transformed again when President Chávez\\'s government seized control of the industry.\\nSome foreign firms remained under new state-led partnerships, while others - most notably ExxonMobil - left the country, and the industry\\'s decline accelerated.\\nMismanagement and corruption have been a problem for the sector, but the government has pointed the finger firmly at US sanctions as a major cause of the decline.\\nBroad economic sanctions were put in place in 2017 during Trump\\'s first term, in response to what it called \"serious abuses of human rights… establishment of an illegitimate Constituent Assembly, which has usurped the power of the democratically elected National Assembly… rampant public corruption\" and \"persecution of, and violence toward, the political opposition\".\\nThe turning point for the US came with the seizure of Nicolás Maduro. President Donald Trump said the US would \"run\" Venezuela and control the sale of its sanctioned oil \"indefinitely\", but a Maduro loyalist - Delcy Rodríguez - has since taken control of Venezuela\\'s armed forces and the country\\'s institutions.\\nWhile defiantly demanding the release of Maduro, who she says has been \"kidnapped\", Rodríguez has co-operated with the Trump administration to reform the law to allow foreign and local oil companies to operate oilfields again, through a new contract model.\\nThe Venezuelan parliament - dominated by Maduro loyalists - approved this major shift on Thursday.\\nMany in Maracaibo are optimistic about potential US investment.\\n\"It would be better because then there would be work, and our children wouldn\\'t have to resort to fishing. They could have a future instead,\" says Carlos Rodríguez. Now in his late 20s, he has worked these waters since he was a teenager.\\nAs he pulls his oil-stained boat out on to the lake, the view is striking. The beauty of the sky contrasts sharply with the water, sometimes blue, but often a murky green from cyanobacteria or stained black. It\\'s easy to see the oil slicking the surface and when I dip my hand in, it comes out streaked with oil.\\n\"It\\'s getting worse every day. Green, black, oily,\" Rodríguez complains. \"And there are fewer fish.\" That morning, he didn\\'t catch a single one.\\nHe hopes that if international oil companies return, they will help clean the lake.\\nOthers are wary. \"We have no problem with [foreign companies] coming to exploit our resources, to drill wells and to create jobs,\" says another fisherman, José Luzardo. \"But we don\\'t want to be anyone\\'s colony.\"\\nHe is a staunch Maduro loyalist, but admits that both his family and colleagues are struggling.\\nTrump \"can come, but he has to pay us for the oil… the oil belongs to Venezuela, it belongs to all Venezuelans\", he says as he prepares to set sail.\\nMany others - in particular people who oppose the government - avoid speaking about politics for fear of repercussions.\\nLater, the sound of the lake\\'s waves lapping against the side of Luzardo\\'s house competes with the sizzle of hot oil. In a kitchen with bare, unplastered walls, a group of women fry the few fish caught that morning. Luzardo says they were lucky. Sometimes they come back home with nothing at all. On those days, they go to bed hungry.\\nBoth the government and the opposition agree on the need for investment.\\nJuan Romero, a member of parliament representing Zulia and a local leader of the ruling PSUV party, says it is the key to the industry\\'s revival.\\n\"In Lake Maracaibo, there are approximately 13,000 wells that could be recovered, and there are reserves of 26 billion barrels of oil,\" he says.\\nWith US sanctions removed, he believes the \"economic strangulation\" of the sector will end and that Venezuela will be able to attract foreign money.\\nBut analysts warn it could take a decade and hundreds of billions of dollars to restore the nation\\'s former output, and industry giants remain cautious. ExxonMobil\\'s chief executive, Darren Woods, labelled the nation \"uninvestable\" in its current state.\\nSpeaking at a White House summit following the removal of Maduro, he pointed out that the company had had its assets seized there twice \"so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes\". Without a new legal framework and stronger protections for investors, he warned that the billions of dollars required for redevelopment would not materialise.\\nYet for many in Maracaibo, hope remains that investment and prosperity will return.\\nAmong them is 93-year-old José Rodas, a retired oil worker who still owns a special-edition Dodge Dart, a classic American muscle car that he bought during the 1970s oil boom.\\n\"Things have become more difficult,\" he says. \"In the past, life was easier. We had comforts then.\"\\nHe points to the \"commissariat\", a central department within the oil camps that not only provided subsidised food but also maintained the workers\\' homes, with fresh coats of paint and new light bulbs.\\nToday, the car sitting on his neglected porch feels like a faded relic of that former life.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Rub the leaf and inhale the fragrance, Michaelus Tracey is saying.\\nThe musky scent of this cannabis plant is distinctly different from the citrusy aroma of another that he is also holding.\\nTo the untrained eye, the neat rows of flowering cannabis crops in front of us are indistinguishable from each other.\\nYet master cultivator Tracey can identify the separate varieties by their smell and the shape of their leaves.\\nNine strains are being grown here at Pineapple Road, a farm deep in the countryside on the Caribbean island of Antigua. The warm temperatures, abundant sunshine, and high humidity make this prime territory for growing the plants.\\nIntense trials were conducted to produce the various strains, Tracey explains. \"We wanted different flavour profiles as well as different effects, but all with a medicinal value - something to help you relax, something to give you more energy, more pain relief, less anxiety.\"\\nLast year marked a decade since Jamaica decriminalised the recreational use of cannabis and legalised its production and sale for medical reasons. Several other Caribbean nations, including the twin island country Antigua and Barbuda in 2018, have since followed suit.\\nSmoking cannabis is emblematic of Caribbean culture, to the extent it has become a cliché. But while the region\\'s affection for the plant is well documented, its status as a leader in the field is less so.\\nToday the region is home to a plethora of legally registered cannabis farms and medicinal dispensaries, where both locals and tourists can purchase the drug if they have a valid medical authorisation card.\\nYet Prof Rose-Marie Belle Antoine, an expert on the cannabis industry in the Caribbean, believes there needs to be further liberalisation.\\n\"Decriminalisation isn\\'t good enough,\" says Antoine, a former chair of the Caribbean Community\\'s Regional Commission on Marijuana. \"We should just make it legal but regulated.\"\\nAntoine is campus principal at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad, where researchers are due to start studying various potential benefits of cannabis.\\nAreas tipped for study range from alleviating the side effects of cancer treatment, to how the plant can boost agriculture by improving soil health. The research will take place in Antigua, where legislation is more progressive.\\nThe work offers \"a lot of potential\", she says, but adds that legalisation would make life easier.\\n\"The Caribbean is a leader in cannabis, in terms of strains and knowledge, and it has a long tradition of this. But legalities, the \\'war on drugs\\' and all that nonsense, stifled not just the industry, but research and development,\" says Antoine.\\nSome in the region hope that US President Donald Trump\\'s executive order in December to reclassify cannabis as a lower-level drug will benefit the Caribbean.\\n\"It\\'s a significant milestone,\" says Alexandra Chong, chief executive of Jamaica-based business Jacana, which sells a range of products derived from cannabis, from extract oil drops to skin cream.\\n\"So much US public policy gets filtered down to the Caribbean,\" she says. \"Because cannabis was classified as a schedule one drug alongside heroin in the US, regulatory bodies across the Caribbean have not been as bullish with [reducing] regulation.\"\\nChong adds that the US reducing cannabis to the lower schedule three level, which also includes combined paracetamol-codeine tablets, was \"far more appropriate\".\\nThe White House lowering the classification of cannabis may mean that in the future Caribbean nations can export the drug to the US for recreational use.\\nHowever, the importation of such cannabis into the US is currently still illegal under federal law. This is despite 24 US states having now legalised the use of the drug recreationally.\\nProducers in both Jamaica and Antigua are keen to start legally exporting the drug. Jamaica\\'s Cannabis Licensing Authority says it \"has put in place interim administrative procedures to facilitate the export of ganja by licensees that hold a valid import permit from the country that the product will be exported to\".\\nMeanwhile, Antigua and Barbuda\\'s Medicinal Cannabis Authority is working hard to develop a cannabis export industry. \"We already have the legal framework in place, a prime geographical location and an international airport,\" the body\\'s chief executive Regis Burton tells the BBC.\\nHe says it\\'s \"highly likely\" that Antigua will eventually be able to export its products, not least for the novelty value. \"Very few people can say they\\'ve tried Antiguan cannabis,\" he adds.\\nDomestically, high overheads in both Jamaica and Antigua and Barbuda – and rules that limit the sale of cannabis to people with medical approval - are said to be leaving most of the market to illegal producers.\\nJacana estimates that more than 800,000 people a year in Jamaica use cannabis, of whom half are tourists. But that 90% of the 87 tonnes of the drug consumed per annum comes through illicit channels.\\nChong adds that \"over-regulation has strangled the industry. Over time it\\'s got easier, but it\\'s by no means perfect\".\\nShe says that due to these problems, she estimates that of the 160-plus licences of various categories granted by Jamaica\\'s Cannabis Licensing Authority between 2017 and 2024, \"very few\" are still in operation.\\nIn Antigua, Robert Hill, a consultant to the industry, says: \"It\\'s still more profitable to import cannabis illegally. Unlike dealers, private companies have staff and bills to pay.\"\\nCurrently the island has just six cannabis farms, four dispensaries and a cannabis lounge, where people can smoke on the premises. At the same time, Antiguan authorities intercepted 45kg of illegally imported cannabis in just 24 hours back in September.\\nMeanwhile, Antigua has been innovative in its approach to domestic illegal growers. Instead of prosecutions, violators were invited to take part in a free six-week course to teach them how to enter the market legally.\\n\"Twenty-two have already graduated, with two soon to transition to a medicinal business,\" Burton tells the BBC. \"The industry won\\'t be successful if the illicit market does as it pleases.\"\\nThe continuing liberalisation of cannabis across the Caribbean is also said to be having a positive impact on social justice for one community in particular.\\nIn 2018, Antigua\\'s Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a formal apology to the country\\'s Rastafarians, for decades of historic persecution, stigma and abuse over their cannabis use. Six years later, the government granted Rastafarians official sacramental authorisation to grow the plants.\\nAnd last summer, it announced plans to expunge the criminal records of people previously prosecuted for possession of small amounts of marijuana.\\nBut for High Priest Selah, of Antigua\\'s Nyabinghi denomination of Rastafarians, memories of the harassment he and others once suffered still linger.\\n\"The police were always coming and locking us up, destroying our plants, tarnishing our name and embarrassing us in public,\" he recalls. Campaigners from his community played a major role in getting the plant decriminalised.\\nBack at Pineapple Road, two employees are carefully hand-rolling joints, each one containing a gram of pure marijuana, for sale in the company\\'s dispensary.\\nBurton hopes more local growers will get on board and keep the industry\\'s proceeds in Caribbean hands.\\nHill agrees. \"We have the ability to compete with much bigger countries thanks to our climate which reduces costs,\" he says, adding: \"We\\'re not trying to create an Amsterdam, this is about wellness.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'From sunrise, throngs of military personnel, government officials and civilians lined the route between Havana\\'s airport and the Armed Forces Ministry to applaud home the remains of 32 Cuban troops killed in Venezuela as they passed by in a funeral cortege.\\nThe country\\'s leadership – from Raul Castro to President Miguel Diaz Canel – were at the airport to receive the boxes carrying the cremated ashes of their \"32 fallen heroes\".\\nIn the lobby of the ministry building, each box was draped in a Cuban flag and set next to a photograph of the respective soldier or intelligence officer beneath the words \"honour and glory\".\\nBut despite the pomp and full military honours, this has been a chastening experience for the Cuban Revolution.\\nFirst, it is believed to be the biggest loss of Cuban combatants at the hands of the US military since the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. The fact that six-and-a-half decades have passed with barely a comparable firefight between Cuban and US troops, either during the Cold War or afterwards, shows how rare it is.\\nIt is not necessarily surprising that the better-trained and better-equipped Delta Force soldiers emerged virtually unscathed, especially given their elite reputation within the most powerful military in the world.\\nBut that is of no comfort to the grieving family members as they tearfully placed their hands on the wooden boxes in Havana.\\nFurthermore, in the days after the US military intervention in Venezuela and the forced removal of Nicolas Maduro from power, the Cuban Government was obliged to admit something it had long denied: the very existence of Cuban intelligence officers inside the corridors of power in Caracas.\\nIt is now clear, as it had been claimed for years by many in Venezuela, that Cubans have been present at every level of the country\\'s security apparatus and that the bilateral intelligence arrangements were a crucial part of Cuba-Venezuela ties.\\nIn short, the Cuban Government has shared its years of experience of how best to maintain an iron grip on power with its Venezuelan partners. The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy.\\nIn the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela\\'s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as \"a terrific person\".\\nRewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of \"narco-terrorists.\"\\nIt seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela.\\nWashington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution.\\nHowever, one of its \"original generation\" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.\\nHe led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt:\\n\"If the US tries to invade, they\\'ll stir up a hornets\\' nest\" he said, quoting Raul Castro. \"They\\'d never even see our combatants coming, men and women.\"\\n\"If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won\\'t be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela\", he says. \"Out here, things would be very different.\"\\nIn the past few days, Cuban state television has shown images of civilian reservists receiving weapons training from the Cuban military.\\nIn truth, pitted against the US military, it would be an uneven fight. The US attack on Venezuela was intended, in part, to underscore that point to the region.\\nThe stakes for Cuba are particularly high.\\nThe island is experiencing widespread blackouts which are bad in Havana but much worse in the provinces. The economy, battered by the US economic embargo and by government mismanagement, is limping along at best. Fuel is scarce and the motor of the economy, tourism, has never recovered to its pre-pandemic levels.\\nIt\\'s into that already-complex picture that Cubans are trying to imagine the near total loss of Venezuelan support. It feels to most like a bleak scenario.\\nBut former-commander, Victor Dreke, is adamant that Cuba has ridden out tough times before and can do so again with enough revolutionary fervour.\\nCuba doesn\\'t want any conflict with Trump administration, he insists, and won\\'t be looking to escalate matters with Washington.\\n\"But that doesn\\'t mean we won\\'t be ready\", he adds, defiantly.\\n'},\n",

He instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro\\'s former vice-president.\\nTrump describes Rodríguez as an \"ally\", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.\\nMachado is expected to use her face time with Trump to try to persuade him that his decision to back Rodríguez\\'s interim government is a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition.\\n\\nA Venezuelan government envoy, too, is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps towards reopening the country\\'s embassy, the New York Times reported.\\n\"The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of the interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, who has been described as \"extremely co-operative\" by the White House.\\nOn Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the $500m energy deal was struck in large part because of help from Rodriguez.\\nShe said the interim president had also confirmed that Venezuela would be releasing political prisoners from Venezuela.\\n\"There were five Americans who were recently released this week as well,\" Leavitt said.\\n\"So, the president likes what he\\'s seeing.

They view her as the best option to avoid the instability that could be triggered by a backlash from supporters of the current government and the colectivos.\\nThey would not welcome the opposition taking power after a US military operation in which Maduro was captured and sent to New York to face drug trafficking and arms charges.\\nThe army and the colectivos are currently unlikely to take orders from the opposition and, at least in the short term, some feel the status quo is safer.\\nA prominent Venezuelan political analyst – who did not want to be named – told the BBC that many people believe Trump\\'s ability to overthrow Maduro was made possible largely because of Machado\\'s efforts to weaken the regime.\\n\"Personally, I doubt that Trump fully believes what he said.

       "  'Article': 'A week on from the dramatic raid that seized Venezuela\\'s Nicolás Maduro, details of the intelligence surrounding the operation are becoming clearer, but some mysteries still remain.\\nThe mission took months of planning and intelligence gathering. In August the CIA is believed to have sent a team of undercover officers into Venezuela.\\nThe US does not have a functioning embassy in the country, so the team could not use diplomatic cover and were working in what is known in the intelligence worlds as a \"denied area\". They were on the ground to scout targets and recruit people who could help.\\nUS officials have said they had one particular source who was able to provide detailed intelligence on Maduro\\'s whereabouts which would have been critical to the operation.\\nIdentities of such sources are normally highly protected but it quickly emerged it was a \"government\" source who must have been particularly close to Maduro and in his inner circle in order to know where he was going to be, and when.\\nThat has led to intense speculation about who it was and what has happened to them. But their identity is still not public.\\nAll of the human intelligence on the ground fed into a \"mosaic\" of intelligence to plan the operation in conjunction with technical intelligence like mapping and satellite imagery.\\nThe scale, speed and success of the operation were unprecedented.\\n\"This thing worked like clockwork. That doesn\\'t happen often,\" explains David Fitzgerald, a former Latin America Chief of Operations for the CIA who also worked on planning missions with the US military.\\n\"It is not the military tactics that drive the operation, but the intelligence.\"\\nAround 150 aircraft were involved in the mission, with helicopters flying only a hundred or so feet above the terrain to get to Maduro\\'s compound.\\nThere are still some mysteries though. One is exactly how the US turned off the lights in Caracas in order to enable the special forces to arrive.\\n\"The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have - it was dark and it was deadly,\" US President Donald Trump said.\\nThe fact that the US Cyber Command was publicly thanked for its role in the operation has led to speculation that US military hackers got inside Venezuelan networks in advance to shut the grid down at the right moment - but details are limited.\\nThe failure of Chinese and Russian air defences has also led to speculation of what kind of jamming or electronic warfare technology was deployed by the US in the air to aid the operation. The US Space Command, which operates satellites, also received credit for creating a \"pathway\" for the special forces to enter unseen.\\nStealth drones were also thought to have been deployed. Exact details of the capabilities used are likely to remain secret, but America\\'s adversaries will be doing their best to try and understand what happened.\\nThose who have planned complex operations say it is remarkable that everything went according to plan, something that does not usually happen. One helicopter was hit but was still able to fly and no US forces were killed.\\nThere are still few details about the battle that took place at Maduro\\'s compound, Fuerte Tiuna.\\nThe Cuban government said that 32 of its nationals were killed by US forces. These were bodyguards provided to defend Maduro by its ally, Cuba. The Caribbean country provides not just bodyguards, but wider security support to the regime.\\n\"Within the immediate perimeter of Maduro, there were probably zero Venezuelan security officers and on the outer perimeter maybe a mixture of both,\" says Fitzgerald.\\nThe fact that they proved so ineffective has also led to questions about whether some elements of the regime facilitated the mission in some way.\\nUS forces were also able to get to Maduro as he was trying to lock himself into a steel safe room but before he could close the door.\\nThey had blowtorches and explosives ready to blow the door open if needed, but the speed of the apprehension again suggests an incredibly detailed understanding of the layout of the compound.\\nThe CIA undertook a classified assessment in advance of the operation, looking at what might happen if Maduro was removed.\\nThe analysts examined a series of options and, according to reports, came to the view that working with elements of the existing regime offered more chance for stability than trying to install the opposition in exile in power. That helped solidify the view that the US should work with Delcy Rodríguez the vice-president.\\nThere are thought to have been back-channel, secret contacts with elements of the Maduro regime in advance of the operation to discuss how people might position themselves given different potential outcomes.\\nThe exact detail of those remain mysterious but they likely do much to explain why the mission took place, why it was successful and also what the plan is next.\\n'},\n",

The henchmen are still there.\\n\"I think it\\'s risky as hell.\"\\nBut the alternative, involving wholesale regime change and backing Machado\\'s opposition movement, would have involved other dangers, including potential infighting among opposition figures and the alienation of those Venezuelans – perhaps as many as 30% – who voted for Maduro.\\nIn his dramatic news conference on Saturday morning, US President Donald Trump shocked many observers by dismissing the Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado as \"not respected\" inside Venezuela, while describing Rodríguez as \"gracious.\"\\n\"I was very surprised to hear the disqualification of María Corina Machado by President Trump,\" Kevin Whitaker, former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Caracas, says.\\n\"Her movement was massively elected... and so disqualifying Machado, in effect, disqualified that whole movement.\"\\nThe speed, and apparent ease, with which Maduro was removed and Rodríguez installed led some observers to speculate that the former vice-president might have been in on the plan.\\n\"I think it\\'s very telling that we just went after Maduro and the vice president survived,\" says former CIA officer Lindsay Moran.\\n\"It\\'s obvious that there were high-placed sources. My immediate speculation was that those high placed sources were in the office of the VP, if not the VP herself.\"\\nBut Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group (ICG) who lives in Caracas, says the conspiracy theory doesn\\'t stand up to close scrutiny, given that enormous power still rests with Venezuela\\'s defence minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, both loyal Maduro allies.\\n\"Why would she sell out Maduro, leaving her defenceless, internally, against the guys who really control the guns,\" Gunson says.\\nInstead, the decision to back Rodríguez followed warnings that installing Machado could result in dangerous levels of instability.\\nIn October, an ICG report warned that \"Washington should beware of regime change\".\\n\"The risks of violence in any post-Maduro scenario should not be downplayed,\" the report urged, saying elements of the security forces could launch a guerilla war against the new authorities.\\nUS seizes two \\'shadow fleet\\' tankers linked to Venezuelan oil\\nOpposition leader Machado says her coalition should lead Venezuela\\n\\'I\\'m a prisoner of war\\' - In the room for Maduro\\'s dramatic court hearing\\n\"We were warning people in the administration, this is not going to work,\" Gunson says. \"There will be violent chaos, it will be your fault and you\\'ll own it.\"\\nOn Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a classified US intelligence assessment reaching the same conclusions and determining that members of the Maduro regime, including Rodríguez, were in a better position to lead a temporary government.\\nThe White House hasn\\'t commented publicly on the report, but made it clear that it plans to work with Rodríguez for the foreseeable future.\\n\"It belies a bit of hard-nosed realism on the part of the Trump administration,\" says Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas programme at Washington\\'s Center for Strategic and International Studies.\\nBut the challenges, he says, have only just begun.\\n\"The capture of Maduro was the easy part. The broader rebuilding of Venezuela, the oil, drugs and democracy goals... are going to take much more time to come to fruition.\"\\nFor now, though, Rodríguez seems to be someone the Trump administration feels it can deal with.\\n\"She\\'s been a bit of an economic reformer,\" Gunson says. \"She\\'s aware of the need for an economic opening and she\\'s not averse to the idea of bringing back foreign capital.\"\\nZiemer agrees that Rodríguez may not find it difficult to do Washington\\'s bidding when it comes to rolling out the welcome mat for US oil companies, offering greater co-operation on counter-narcotics and even scaling down Venezuela\\'s relations with Cuba, China and Russia, especially if it means the gradual lifting of US sanctions.\\n\"I think she can deliver on that,\" he says.\\n\"But if the US is asking for genuine progress towards a democratic transition, that becomes much harder.\"\\nAt the moment, this does not appear to be high on Washington\\'s list of priorities.\\nIn remarks to the media on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of a three-stage plan for Venezuela, starting with stabilisation of the country and the marketing of 30-50 million barrels of oil under US supervision.\\nThe plan would lead to what Rubio called \"a process of reconciliation\", including amnesties for opposition forces, the release of political prisoners and the rebuilding of civil society.\\n\"The third phase, of course, will be one of transition,\" he said, without elaborating.\\nArticle 233 of Venezuela\\'s constitution calls for fresh elections within 30 days of a president becoming \"permanently unavailable to serve\" - something that would seem to apply to a situation in which Maduro languishes in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial.\\nBut in an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump said elections were not on the horizon. \"We have to fix the country first,\" he said. \"You can\\'t have an election.\"\\nGunson says Washington\\'s decision not to go for regime change in the short term might make sense, but the absence of a medium- or long-term prospect is disappointing.\\n\"Trump may be getting something out of this, but Venezuelans aren\\'t,\" he says. \"Ordinary Venezuelans are getting screwed as usual.\"\\nWith the Trump administration talking up the prospects of international oil companies re-investing in Venezuela\\'s corrupt and moribund petroleum infrastructure, Gunson says the reality may be more complicated.\\n\"Nobody\\'s going to come in here with the tens of billions of dollars that are required... to start the recovery process if the government is illegitimate and there\\'s no rule of law,\" he says.\\nWhen the former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez designated Maduro as his successor shortly before his death in 2013, the move was described as Chavez\\'s \"dedazo\", a Spanish slang term meaning a \"finger pointing\", a personal anointment which bypasses the normal democratic process.\\nAmbassador Shapiro sees a parallel with the rise to power of Delcy Rodríguez.\\n\"This is Trump\\'s dedazo,\" he says.\\n'},\n",

She\\'s a very nice woman, but she doesn\\'t have the respect.\"\\nMachado, who has been in hiding for months after being barred from running in the 2024 presidential elections in Venezuela, previously called for the opposition\\'s substitute candidate Edmundo González to assume power after Maduro\\'s arrest.\\nMachado rallied support for González in the election, and vote tallies released by her party suggest he won by a landslide.\\nHowever, Maduro was declared president by Venezuela\\'s electoral council (CNE), a body dominated by government loyalists. The US and dozens of other countries recognised González as the president-elect.\\nDavid Smolansky, a spokesman for the Venezuelan opposition, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that there was no future for a well-functioning country without González and Machado in power.\\n\"They could guarantee a democratic transition, and they have the respect of Venezuelans and several governments across the world,\" he said.\\nAsked why he thought Trump had so far chosen to back Venezuela\\'s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez - formerly Maduro\\'s vice-president - rather than the opposition, Smolansky said: \"Every transition, when it begins, is not perfect - it\\'s messy.\"\\nHe also responded to suggestions that the opposition\\'s lack of support within the military was one of the reasons Trump had chosen to back Rodríguez, saying there were members of the armed forces - both currently serving and in exile - that were ready to work with them.\\nMachado has said nobody trusted Rodríguez, telling CBS that the interim leader was \"one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people\" in the South American country.\\n\"Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,\" Machado said.\\nWhile Rodríguez, 56, has faced US sanctions for her ministerial roles in the Maduro administration, she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.\\nRodríguez was sworn in on Monday, two days after a US special forces breached Venezuelan security to arrest Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores.\\nEarlier on Tuesday, Rodríguez rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela.\\n\"The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does,\" she said in a televised speech. \"There is no external agent governing Venezuela.\"\\n'},\n",

These issues will continue to be matters for international discussion.\"\\nCooper added she had also spoken with Rubio about the role the UK could play in supporting a peaceful democratic transition that respected the will of the Venezuelan people.\\nResponding, Badenoch asked if the prime minister had spoken to Trump, saying: \"I ask this because the government talks up its relationship with the US, but we keep finding we\\'re not in the room when big decisions are made\".\\nShe said the Conservatives understood Trump\\'s actions and accused the government of being too distant from its \"closest security partner\".\\n\"We must work with them seriously, not snipe from the sidelines,\" she said.\\n\"We on this side of the House understand why the US has taken this action. As the foreign secretary said, UK policy has long been to press for a peaceful transition from authoritarian rule to a democracy. That never happened.\\n\"Instead, Venezuelans have been living under Maduro\\'s brutal regime for many years. The US has made it clear it is acting in its national interest against drug smuggling and other criminal activity, including potential terrorism.\"\\nThe Conservative leader added she was concerned about the precedent set by Trump\\'s actions in Venezuela, and said the \"rules-based order\" should be protected.\\nHowever, Labour backbenchers and other opposition parties including the Liberal Democrats and the SNP continued to pile on pressure for the government to explicitly condemn Trump\\'s actions.\\n\\nDame Emily told the Commons Trump\\'s actions had created a \"profound risk of international norms changing\" if the government did not start \"calling out\" breaches of international law.\\n\"It is for the West surely to stand up and say, call it as it is,\" she said.\\nCooper replied: \"I have raised this issue of international law with Secretary of State Rubio and made clear that we will continue to urge all countries to follow it.\"\\nLiberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said the UK government\\'s refusal to brand Donald Trump\\'s actions a \"clear breach of international law\" looked \"ridiculous\", adding: \"Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator, but that does not give President Trump a free pass for illegal action.\"\\nBut Cooper demurred, insisting the focus should be on Venezuela\\'s \"transition to democracy\".\\nLabour MP for Leeds East Richard Burgon labelled the attack on Venezuela \"disgusting\", claiming the prime minister would not be acting in the same way if the military action had been taken by Putin.\\nHe said: \"Isn\\'t the reality that the prime minister is willing to ditch international law and sidestep the United Nations charter in order to appease Donald Trump, and doesn\\'t this cowardly, craven approach drag this country\\'s reputation through the dirt?\"\\nCooper later told MPs: \"I really would warn members against making equivalence here around what Putin has done in Ukraine, where thousands of children have been kidnapped, where they have invaded a country led by a democratically elected president.\\n\"We should be careful about recognising what we say and the implications of it.\"\\nAllegations of the illegal deportation of children from Ukraine since Russia\\'s invasion nearly four years ago led to an international arrest warrant being issued for Putin. Ukraine has said more than 19,000 children were removed to Russia. Moscow maintains the children were evacuated from danger.\\nUkraine\\'s missing children tracked down in Russia by digital sleuths\\nAlthough Cooper was at pains not to condemn Trump\\'s actions in Venezuela, she warned that Greenland\\'s future was a matter for Greenlanders and Danes, and no-one else, at the end of her statement.\\nTrump has once again raised the prospect the US could annex Greenland, claiming he needs the semi-autonomous Danish territory for reasons of national security.\\nGreenland\\'s Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen has described the notion of US control over the island as a \"fantasy\", and Denmark\\'s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has urged the US to \"stop the threats\" over the island.\\nIn her statement on Venezuela, Cooper said: \"Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\\n\"Our close European partners, our long-standing Nato allies and all our countries work closely together on security issues, and will always do so.\\n\"The future of Greenland is a matter for the Greenlanders and Danes, and no-one else.\"\\nSpeaking in the debate, former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Jeremy Hunt warned that US attempts to take Greenland could result in the collapse of Nato (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) and accused European leaders of appearing \"weak and divided\".\\n\"Most people\\'s view of Maduro\\'s capture will be \\'good riddance\\', and I would have liked the government to be more categorical in supporting US action in removing an illegitimate and evil dictator,\" he told the Commons.\\n\"But, if the new US approach extends to the annexation of Greenland, the sovereign territory of a Nato member, it could mean the end of the alliance with disastrous consequences.\"\\nHe asked what the Foreign Office was doing to prevent such \"a disaster\" and Cooper replied the government was \"very firm\" on the issue.\\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

       "  'Article': 'The US seizing of Venezuela\\'s leader has faced strong criticism from both America\\'s friends and foes at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.\\nMany member states agreed with the US that Nicolás Maduro had been an illegitimate and repressive leader.\\nBut many also condemned the US military action as a breach of international law and the UN Charter, and they demanded a democratic transition that reflected the will of the Venezuelan people.\\nAmong US allies, France was by far the most outspoken. The deputy ambassador, Jay Dharmadhikari, said Maduro\\'s taking by the US runs \"counter to the principle of peaceful dispute resolution and runs counter to the principle of the non-use of force\".\\nHe told the Council: \"The proliferation of violations of the Charter of the UN and the violations of international law by states vested with responsibility as permanent members of Security Council chips away at the very foundation of the international order, contravening the principles of the charter, including the principle of respect for independence and territorial integrity of states, undermines the foundation of the UN and weakens international peace and security.\"\\nThe deputy UN ambassador for Denmark, Sandra Jensen Landi, voiced her country\\'s \"deep concern\" at the evolving situation and said: \"These developments constitute a dangerous precedent. International law and the UN Charter… must be respected.\"\\nBoth these statements – by France and Denmark - represent a significant stiffening of European criticism of the seizing of Maduro after some initial equivocation by many EU members. In contrast, both UK and Greek diplomats at the UN did not condemn the US military operation.\\nThe ambassador for Panama, Eloy Alfaro de Alba, expressed concern about US plans to work with the existing regime, without involving the opposition or holding fresh elections.\\nHe told the Council: \"Any attempt to establish a permanent government headed by a figure from the repressive apparatus such as Delcy Rodriguez would constitute continuity of the system and not a genuine transition.\"\\nColombia\\'s ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said there is no justification for the unilateral use of force to commit an act of aggression: \"Such actions constitute a serious violation of international law and the UN Charter.\"\\nRussia\\'s ambassador, Vassili Nebenzia, accused the US of \"international banditry\" and \"neo-colonialism and imperialism\".\\nHe said there was no justification for \"US domination by force\" and accused US allies of hypocrisy and double standards for failing to criticise Trump.\\nChina\\'s Chargé d\\'Affaires, Sun Lei, said Beijing was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemned\" what he called the \"unilateral, illegal and bullying acts of the US\".\\nIn a statement read out on his behalf, Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, said he remained \"deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected\" during the US action: \"The power of the law must prevail.\"\\nBy contrast, the acting UK ambassador, James Kariuki, gave a very brief statement, saying merely the UK wanted to see a \"safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people\".\\nHe added, without being specific, that the UK \"reaffirms its commitment to international law and the principles enshrined in the charter of the UN\". Greece\\'s deputy ambassador, Ioannis Stamatekos, also failed to condemn Trump\\'s seizure of Maduro, calling instead for \"dialogue and diplomacy\" to resolve the crisis.\\nFor the US, UN ambassador Mike Waltz said the capture of Maduro was a law-enforcement operation against an illegitimate leader responsible for both drug trafficking and terrorism.\\n\"You can\\'t turn Venezuela into the operating hub for Iran, for Hezbollah, for gangs, for the Cuban intelligence agents and other malign actors that control that country,\" Waltz told the Council. \"You cannot continue to have the largest energy reserves in the world under the control of adversaries of the US.\"\\nFor many European countries, the seizing of Maduro has posed a difficult diplomatic dilemma.\\nSome have been torn between defending fundamental principles of the UN charter that countries should not breach each other\\'s sovereignty, or making a pragmatic, real politik decision not to anger the US on whose support and security they rely, especially for Ukraine\\nHence UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer\\'s refusal to say if the US attack on Venezuela was a breach of international law. He said merely that \"international law is the framework, is the anchor or the benchmark against which we judge the actions of all other governments. And it is, of course, for the US to justify the action that it has taken\".\\nLikewise, the EU issued its own statement, saying that \"under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be upheld\" without saying whether that applied in this case.\\nThe EU considered Maduro illegitimate and his drug trafficking a \"significant security threat worldwide\" but the bloc said nothing about Trump\\'s declaration that the US will now \"run\" the country.\\nThe French and Danish criticism now places them alongside Spain, which had been the only European country to voice concerns, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez saying his government would \"not recognise an intervention that violates international law and pushes the region toward a horizon of uncertainty and belligerence\".\\nThe difficulty for other European leaders, fearful of upsetting Trump, is that they risk accusations of hypocrisy from other countries.\\nFor years, European powers have argued Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine should be opposed in part because it broke international rules about territorial integrity.\\nMany developing countries rejected that argument, citing western military adventurism from Vietnam to Iraq. They will now add Venezuela to that list.\\nThe question is how Europe may respond in the longer term to America\\'s military operation in Venezuela. Will it provide a catalyst for the continent to take greater responsibility for its own security in the face of so much instability from what many see as an unreliable ally?\\nDonald Tusk, the prime minister of Poland, certainly hopes so, saying on social media: \"No-one will take seriously a weak and divided Europe: neither enemy nor ally. It is already clear now.\\n\"We must finally believe in our own strength, we must continue to arm ourselves, we must stay united like never before. One for all, and all for one. Otherwise, we are finished.\"\\n'},\n",

Trump has said the US will run the country - and manage its oil reserves - until a permanent replacement for Maduro can be established.\\nMaduro has previously rejected US claims he has direct involvement in drug trafficking.\\nBut even for those who are grateful to see Maduro gone, there\\'s still a lot of fear and uncertainty, several Venezuelans told the BBC.\\nDina isn\\'t putting much faith in Trump.\\n\"He says something now and tomorrow he changes his mind,\" Dina said. \"I mean, I\\'m not used to taking his words seriously.\"\\nThe \"only thing that was good\" about what Trump has said since Maduro\\'s capture, Dina said, was that the US will be investing in Venezuela, which she hopes will lead to \"a better economic situation\" for the struggling country.\\nThe danger of speaking out against Maduro is still very real within Venezuela, as the National Assembly - which is dominated by Maduro loyalists - passed a law a few weeks ago declaring anyone who expresses support for US naval blockades a \"traitor\".\\nJorge said he saw motorcyclists from colectivos - pro-government paramilitary groups in Venezuela - roaming the streets with weapons on Friday.\\n\"It makes you a bit afraid to even go out to buy bread right now,\" he said. \"We\\'ll have to wait for the best and have patience.\"\\nJorge added that he was worried about the influence of Maduro\\'s ally, Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela\\'s Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace.\\n\"He is a very bad person, very spiteful,\" Jorge said. \"I don\\'t know how many people he has on his side. Hopefully, the army stands with the people and he loses some control.\"\\nSandra echoed Jorge and Dina\\'s relief at Maduro\\'s ousting. But, she too is sceptical about the future and what it means for Venezuelans in exile.\\nClose to eight million Venezuelans have left Venezuela since Maduro came to power - and many of them have been openly celebrating Maduro\\'s capture in the streets of the cities where they have settled.\\nIn addition to the millions in exile, others are \"missing, imprisoned, dead, or merely surviving\" - which is \"a true tragedy that had not been addressed by any country\", Sandra said.\\n\"This is only the beginning. We know there is still a long road ahead,\" Sandra added. \"No country had previously heard the cry of Venezuelans in the face of this tragedy\".\\nAdditional reporting by Kristina Volk\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The US may want many of its foes gone from power. It doesn\\'t usually send in the military and physically remove them.\\nVenezuela\\'s abrupt awakening took two forms.\\nIts residents were woken abruptly to the sound of deafening booms: the sound of its capital Caracas under attack from US strikes targeting military infrastructure.\\nIts government has now woken up from any illusion that US military intervention or regime change was just a distant threat.\\nUS President Donald Trump has announced Venezuela\\'s leader, Nicolás Maduro, has been captured and flown out of the country.\\nThis was a man who wielded a huge amount of power: his government controlled the electoral system, the judiciary, the military, as well as having the loyalty of powerful militia groups.\\nBy the end of Saturday, he was pictured in a grey tracksuit, his hands bound, his eyes blindfolded, being transported to detention in the US. It was an extraordinary fall from power.\\nThe US has long accused Maduro of leading a criminal trafficking organisation, something he strongly denies. It designated as a foreign terrorist group the \\'Cartel de los Soles\\' - a name the US uses to describe a group of elites in Venezuela who it alleges orchestrate illegal activities like drug trafficking and illegal mining.\\nMaduro now faces a US trial over weapons and drugs charges.\\nFor years, Maduro\\'s government has been accused of human rights abuses.\\nIn 2020, United Nations investigators said its government had committed \"egregious violations\" amounting to crimes against humanity such as extrajudicial killings, torture, violence and disappearances - and that Maduro and other top officials were implicated.\\nHuman rights organisations have recorded hundreds of political prisoners in the country, including some detained after anti-government protests.\\nThese are reasons many in and outside the country wanted him gone, despite him still having some loyal followers. But that doesn\\'t make Saturday\\'s events straightforward.\\nThe US has not carried out direct military intervention in Latin America like this since its 1989 invasion of Panama to depose the then-military ruler, Manuel Noriega.\\nBack then, like now, Washington framed this as part of wider crackdown on drug trafficking and criminality.\\nThis latest operation, striking inside a sovereign capital directly, is a dramatic escalation in US engagement in the region.\\nThe forcible removal of Maduro will be hailed a major victory by some of the more hawkish figures within the US administration, many of whom have argued that only direct intervention could force Maduro from power.\\nWashington has not recognised him as the country\\'s president since the 2024 elections. The opposition published electronic voting tallies after the vote which it said proved it, not Maduro, won the election.\\nThe result was deemed neither free nor fair by international election observers. The opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was barred from running in it.\\nBut for Venezuela\\'s government, this intervention confirms what it has long claimed - that Washington\\'s ultimate goal is regime change.\\nFollow live: US launches strikes on Venezuela\\nWatch: Reporter in Caracas describes hearing loud bangs and planes\\nWhat we know about Maduro\\'s capture\\nWhy has Donald Trump attacked Venezuela?\\nVenezuela has also accused the US of wanting to \"steal\" its oil reserves, the largest in the world, and other resources – an allegation it felt was vindicated after the US seized at least two oil tankers off the coast.\\nThe strikes and capture come after months of US military escalation in the region.\\nThe US has sent its biggest military deployment in decades to the region, comprising warplanes, thousands of troops, helicopters and the world\\'s largest warship. It has carried out dozens of strikes on alleged small drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, killing at least 110 people.\\nAny doubts that remained that those operations were at least in part about regime change too have now been dashed by today\\'s actions.\\nIt remains deeply unclear what comes next inside Venezuela itself. Trump has claimed the US will now \"run\" Venezuela but has not clarified what he means by that.\\nWill the US try to push for fresh elections? Will it try to depose further senior members of the government or the military and force them to face justice in the US?\\nTrump said he was not afraid of putting \"boots on the ground\" and hinted bigger strikes could come if deemed necessary.\\nMore surprisingly, he also said the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado didn\\'t have the \"support or respect\" in Venezuela to take power. She frequently praised Trump and they were allies. Many expected him to back her in any power transition.\\nInstead, he insinuated he could instead work with Maduro\\'s deputy Delcy Rodriguez saying she was essentially \"willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"\\nMs Rodriguez was part of Maduro\\'s regime. Trump appears to be suggesting they\\'re keen to work with her on a negotiated transition.\\nCould this mean leaving power in exchange for not facing the same fate as Maduro? Or assuming power but allying with the US, including for example allowing more access to its vast oil reserves? And if so, how would other Maduro allies who have long-accused the US of imperialist tendencies, and Venezuela\\'s opposition who loathe Maduro\\'s regime, react to that?\\nMs Machado has said the opposition\\'s 2024 election candidate Edmundo Gonzalez should \"assume\" the presidency and heralded this action as a day of \"freedom\" for Venezuela. There were celebrations among some Venezuelans in the country and overseas who feel this could mark the end of an authoritarian rule and pave the way for a much freer country.\\nNot everyone aligned with the opposition agrees though. Some may be fierce critics of Maduro, but also deeply sceptical of US intervention in the country – not least because of the US\\'s record of backing coups and regime change, some of which led to dictatorships and human rights abuses themselves.\\nOthers warn this would not also be simple given the government\\'s grip on power in the country.\\nIt controls the judiciary, the Supreme Court, the military – and is aligned with powerfully armed paramilitaries known as \"colectivos\".\\nSome fear US intervention could trigger violent fragmentation and a prolonged power struggle.\\nFor Maduro\\'s closest allies, Saturday\\'s events raise urgent questions and fears about their own futures.\\nMany may not want to give up the fight or allow a transition unless they feel they could receive some kind of protection or reassurance from persecution themselves.\\nAs for Trump, his administration has become increasingly muscular in the region with its financial bailout for Argentina, tariffs on Brazil to try to influence the coup trial of Trump ally and former president Jair Bolsonaro, and now the military intervention in Venezuela.\\nHe benefits from having more allies in the region now - with the continent shifting rightwards in recent elections in Ecuador, Argentina and Chile. But while Maduro has few allies in the region, some regional powers such as Brazil and Colombia do not support US military intervention.\\nAnd some of Trump\\'s own MAGA base in the US are also not happy at his growing interventionism after promising to put \"America First\".\\nIf it is safe to do so, you can get in touch by following this link\\n'},\n",

In others, it was a backlash against leftist governments mired in corruption or infighting.\\nIn Chile, immigration and crime seemed to swing it.\\nKast promised a border wall and mass deportations of undocumented migrants.\\nAt rallies, he counted down the days until the inauguration and warned that those without papers should leave by then if they wanted the chance to ever return.\\nHis message resonated in a country which has seen a rapid growth in its foreign-born population. Government figures show that by 2023 there were nearly two million non-nationals living in Chile, a 46% increase from 2018.\\nThe government estimates about 336,000 undocumented migrants live in Chile, many from Venezuela.\\nThe speed of that change has unsettled many Chileans.\\n\"Chile was not prepared to receive the wave of immigration it did,\" says Jeremías Alonso, a Kast supporter who volunteered to mobilise young voters during the campaign.\\nHe rejects critics\\' accusations that Kast\\'s rhetoric amounts to xenophobia.\\n\"What Kast is saying is that foreigners should come to Chile, let them come to work, but they should enter properly through the door, not through the window,\" he says, arguing that undocumented migrants are a strain on taxpayer-funded public services.\\nHe says his working-class neighbourhood has experienced \"the social changes that irregular immigration brings in terms of crime, drug addiction and security\".\\n\\nKast has blamed rising crime on immigration, an allegation that resonates politically even as the number of murders has fallen since peaking in 2022, and despite some studies suggesting migrants commit fewer crimes on average.\\nMany voters cite organised crime, drug trafficking, thefts and carjackings as contributing towards their sense of insecurity.\\nKast\\'s victory message is that migrants will be welcome if they comply with the law, criminals will be locked up and order will return to the streets.\\nHe, like Trump, is expected to move quickly to demonstrate an \"iron fist\" approach, deploying the military to the border and probably promoting his crackdown through social media.\\nBut in practice, large-scale deportations will be difficult.\\nVenezuela does not accept deportees from Chile and deportations have so far been limited.\\nKast seems to hope his rhetoric will encourage irregular migrants to leave voluntarily. But this is unlikely to compel hundreds of thousands to pack up.\\nFor irregular migrants already in Chile, the future feels uncertain.\\nGabriel Funez, a Venezuelan waiter, moved to Chile four years ago, crossing the land border irregularly to escape his country\\'s \"very, very bad economic situation\".\\nHe has since submitted his documents to police and immigration authorities and received a temporary ID so he can pay taxes but has so far had no response to his visa request.\\nHis salary is currently being paid into a friend\\'s bank account. \"I\\'m basically a ghost here,\" he says.\\nWhile he fears deportation, his bigger concern is a rise in xenophobia, which he says has already increased.\\n\"Kast is expressing what many Chileans want to express. He\\'s validating it,\" he said.\\nHe recalls how at the restaurant where he works, he served diners who were discussing how migrants should leave.\\n\"It was uncomfortable. I\\'m a foreigner, and I\\'m hearing all those super hurtful words.\"\\nHe explains that about 90% percent of the restaurant\\'s staff are migrants.\\nWith migrants increasingly key to Chilean businesses, Kast could come up against opposition from those relying on foreign labour for their business.\\nCarlos Alberto Cossio, a Bolivian national who has lived in Chile for 35 years, runs a business making and delivering salteñas, savoury Bolivian pastries.\\nHe says he has often employed workers from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela and insists that \"the migrant workforce is very important\".\\nHe explains that migrants are eager to work and less likely to change jobs as they rely on their employer for a contract visa until they are issued with a permanent visa.\\n\"Many companies, especially in fruit harvesting, employ migrant workers who are not necessarily registered,\" he adds.\\nExpelling unregistered workers \"will impact Chile\\'s export economy and make raw materials more expensive,\" he warns.\\nMr Cossio acknowledges that there has been some friction since large numbers of migrants arrived from Venezuela to escape the economic and political crisis there.\\n\"Many of the customs they have brought haven\\'t been compatible with Chilean customs,\" he says, lamenting how this has damaged the reputation of migrants who want to work and contribute.\\nMr Kast\\'s party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning some of his proposals, from tougher sentencing to maximum-security prisons, may require compromise and negotiation.\\nBut for many voters, the perception of control may matter just as much as delivering results as anxiety over crime, insecurity and migration is sweeping the continent.\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Kast has openly praised Chile\\'s former right-wing dictator, Augusto Pinochet.\\nIn his first speech to supporters as president-elect, Kast said: \"Chile will once again be free from crime, free from anguish, free from fear.\"\\n\"Criminals, delinquents - their lives are going to change. We\\'re going to look for them, find them, judge them and then we\\'re going to lock them up,\" he added.\\nAt a gathering of his backers in the capital Santiago, many draped in Chilean flags, chanting and taking selfies, there was jubilation as the results came through.\\n\"I\\'m happy we can recover the country\\'s security and patriotism,\" said Augustina Trancoso, donning a red \"Make Chile Great Again\" cap.\\n\"We\\'ve been trying to win an election for years,\" said Belem Valdivieso. \"In Chile, you used to be able to walk the streets peacefully, lately we\\'ve experienced problems with insecurity. I\\'m hoping his promises will be kept and he\\'ll focus on security.\"\\nThroughout the campaign, Kast portrayed Chile as a country that was descending into chaos and insecurity. He pledged to restore order and crack down on irregular immigration, as well as implementing sharp spending cuts.\\nKast is an admirer of Donald Trump, who is likely to become a close ally, and his policies echo those of the US president. He has pledged a border wall on Chile\\'s porous frontier with Peru and Bolivia, maximum-security prisons, and mass deportations of irregular migrants, many of whom are from Venezuela.\\nChile is one of the safest and more stable countries in South America, but a rise in immigration and organised crime in recent years has concerned many voters. Kast regularly drew links between the two.\\nHis critics, though, say the problem is being exaggerated.\\nOne voter in Santiago, Javiera Carrasco, liked some of Kast\\'s policies but ended up voting for Communist Party member Jara. She said she felt \"like a false sense of insecurity is becoming widespread.\"\\n\"In other countries, there are much worse things happening than here. It just doesn\\'t add up for me.\"\\nChile\\'s murder rate is now falling, and some studies suggest those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average. But the perception of growing insecurity was the motivation for many of Kast\\'s voters.\\n\"We are transforming into Colombia, a lot of terrorism, thieves, robbery, society is very unsafe,\" one voter Max Struber said.\\n\"It may sound harsh to say it, but we need the government to continue Pinochet\\'s work. Human rights abuses existed, that\\'s true. But as a government it was good, we used to have peace and tranquility.\"\\nKast\\'s brother was a minister during Pinochet\\'s dictatorship, and his father was a member of the Nazi party. Pinochet was an army general who led a US-backed military coup in 1973 and established a 17-year-long military dictatorship that was marked by brutal human rights abuses, forced disappearances and free-market economic policies.\\nChile\\'s current left-wing President Gabriel Boric, who could not run again, had suffered from low approval ratings. Kast\\'s rival Jeannette Jara may have suffered by being seen as a \"continuity vote\".\\nA supporter at his victory party, Francisco Otero, said neither candidate represented everybody perfectly, but that a continuation of the government was seen as \"much worse\".\\nAfter the result Jara posted that \"democracy has spoken loud and clear\" and wished Kast \"success for the good of Chile.\"\\n\"We will continue working to advance a better life in our country,\" she added.\\nHer supporters fear Kast\\'s election marks a return to Chile\\'s far-right past.\\n\"Kast\\'s family helped the dictator Augusto Pinochet,\" Ricardo Herrera said, adding that he lived through Pinochet\\'s dictatorship and it was \"brutal\".\\nSome are sceptical, though, that Kast will actually do what he\\'s pledged.\\n\"Kast says he wants to expel 360,000 undocumented migrants. He won\\'t be able to do that. It\\'s physically impossible,\" one voter Hector Lunes said.\\nKast has also been firmly against abortion, even in cases of rape, and environmental protection policies.\\nHis victory will likely be welcomed by investors as he has pledged a free-market approach to economics to shrink the state and deregulate certain industries.\\nThis was the first presidential election in Chile where voting was mandatory and registration was automatic for those eligible.\\nThis left some voters feeling like they had to pick whichever they say was the \"least-worst\" option.\\n\"I don\\'t know if I\\'d say the lesser of two evils, but I think Chile needs a change,\" Claudio Sanjuez said, \"and I clearly think Kast could be that alternative\".\\n\"Both candidates were like opposite extremes,\" Cintia Urrutia said, but added she\\'d hoped for Jeannette Jara who she perceived as more \"centrist\".\\nKast\\'s victory in Chile follows a string of elections in Latin America that have shifted the region to the Right in recent years – including in Argentina, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and El Salvador.\\nHe will be inaugurated on 11 March 2026. At rallies, he regularly counted down the days until this date warning undocumented immigrants that they should leave before then if they ever want the chance to return.\\n'},\n",

It\\'s pitch black. We\\'re using flashlights to communicate. This is very scary, lots of things can go wrong.\"\\nDespite the risks, they didn\\'t. Machado arrived safely in Oslo, Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize just before midnight on Wednesday.\\nMachado had been living in hiding in her own country since Venezuela\\'s widely disputed elections last year, and hadn\\'t been seen in public since January. Her grown-up children, who she hadn\\'t seen in two years, were in Oslo to greet her.\\nGrey Bull specialises in rescue missions and evacuations, especially from conflict and disaster zones. A representative from Machado\\'s team confirmed to CBS News, the BBC\\'s US media partner, that the organisation was behind her rescue operation.\\nMr Stern said that Grey Bull had been building up a presence in the Caribbean, including inside Venezuela and the neighbouring island of Aruba, for months to get ready for potential operations in Venezuela.\\n\"We\\'ve been building infrastructure on the ground in Venezuela designed to get Americans, allies and Brits and other people out should the war in Venezuela start,\" he told the BBC.\\nSpeculation has been mounting over possible US military action against Venezuela, after US President Donald Trump called on President Maduro to leave office, accusing him of sending narcotics and murderers to the US.\\nMr Stern said the challenge in this case was getting somebody out who is as well-known as María Corina Machado - a household name in Venezuela for the opposition.\\nNone of the infrastructure his firm had built up in the country, he said, was \"designed for the second most popular person in the damn country with a target on her back.\"\\nWhen he was first put in contact with Machado\\'s team, they did not initially disclose her identity, but Mr Stern said he was able to guess.\\nWhen they got in touch with him in early December, through a contact who knew Machado\\'s team, it was apparently the second attempt to get her out of Venezuela, after an initial plan \"didn\\'t go well,\" Mr Stern said.\\nThe operation was dubbed \"Golden Dynamite\" because \"Nobel invented dynamite\" and Machado was trying to get to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize award.\\nMatters moved quickly. Mr Stern said he spoke with the team on a Friday, they deployed on the Sunday, and by Tuesday, their mission was complete.\\nHis team had explored various possibilities to get Machado out of the country, and settled on a plan that involved a tumultuous sea journey.\\nTo protect his future work in Venezuela, Mr Stern can only reveal so much about the trip.\\nBy land, they moved Machado from a house where she was in hiding, to a pick-up spot for a small boat, which took her off the coast to a slightly bigger boat where she met up with him.\\nThe voyage was in \"very rough seas\" with waves of up to 10ft (3m) in \"pitch-black darkness,\" he said.\\n\"The journey was not fun. It was cold, it was very wet, we were all soaked, the waves were very rough, and we used that to our advantage. We got her to land and to where her plane was, and she flew to Norway.\"\\nThroughout the journey, he added that various steps were taken to mask and disguise Machado\\'s face, as well as her digital profile because she is so well-known.\\n\"The biometric threat is so real,\" he noted, adding steps were taken to make sure she could not be traced via her phone.\\nHe said that Machado was \"formidable\" despite the conditions, accepting a jumper for warmth, but not asking for anything else.\\n\"She was soaking wet and freezing cold and didn\\'t complain once,\" he laughed, acknowledging the operation was very dangerous because water is \"unforgiving\".\\n\"If I am driving a boat and blow an engine, I\\'m swimming to Venezuela.\"\\nWhen asked how he could guarantee the safety of Venezuelans who helped with the operation, Mr Stern said they kept their identities secret and \"we [Grey Bull] do a lot of deception operations\".\\nMany of those who helped didn\\'t even realise they were working for him, Mr Stern said, while others think they \"know the whole story\", but they really don\\'t.\\n\"There are people who did things that were benign from their perspective - but mission-critical from our perspective.\"\\nHe said the operation was financed by donors, and not by the US government: \"We\\'ve never had a thank-you note from the US government, let alone a dollar.\"\\nMr Stern said he did coordinate with some nation states, and with intelligence and diplomatic services of several countries. This included alerting the US in an \"informal\" manner.\\nMachado has said she intends to return to Venezuela, but Mr Stern said he advised her not to do that.\\n\"I told her, \\'don\\'t go back. You\\'re a Mum. We need you.\\' She\\'s going to do what she\\'s going to do...

The US was also involved, the report says, but it is unclear to what extent.\\nMachado did not deny these details to the BBC, but also would not elaborate on the journey.\\nAsked at a news conference if US authorities helped her, Machado said: \"Yes, we did get support from the United States government.\"\\n\"They [the Venezuelan government] say I\\'m a terrorist and have to be in jail for the rest of my life and they\\'re looking for me,\" she said previously. \"So leaving Venezuela today, in these circumstances, is very, very dangerous.\\n\"I just want to say today that I\\'m here, because many men and women risked their lives in order for me to arrive in Oslo.\"\\nJorgen Watne Frydnes - chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, who sat with Machado during the interview - had described her journey to Norway as \"a situation of extreme danger\".\\nSitting next to her during the BBC interview, he said it was an \"emotional\" moment for him.\\n\"In the middle of the night to have you here, it\\'s incredible,\" he said. \"It\\'s hard to describe what it means to the Nobel committee and to all of us.\"\\nMachado accused Maduro\\'s regime of being funded by criminal activities such as drugs and human trafficking, repeating calls for the international community to help Venezuela \"cut those inflows\" of criminal resources.\\n\"We need to address this regime not as a conventional dictatorship, but as a criminal structure,\" she told the BBC.\\nMaduro has always vehemently denied being connected to cartels.\\nWhen asked whether she would support a US military strike on Venezuelan soil, given Washington\\'s recent attacks on alleged drug vessels, Machado did not answer directly but instead accused Maduro of \"giving away our sovereignty to criminal organisations\".\\n\"We didn\\'t want a war, we didn\\'t look for it… it was Maduro who declared war on the Venezuelan people,\" she added.\\nMachado says she and her team are ready to form a government in Venezuela, and that she offered to sit down with Maduro\\'s team to work out a peaceful transition, but \"they rejected it\".\\nThe BBC asked Nobel Committee chairman Mr Frydnes whether a possible violent takeover to unseat Nicolás Maduro would contradict her Peace Prize.\\nHe said the burden for peace should be placed on the current Venezuelan government: \"The power lies in the Maduro regime, they have the responsibility to make sure this is a peaceful transition.\"\\nEven after she was barred from the election last year, Machado continued to campaign for the candidate who replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González.\\nMaduro was declared the winner, even though polling station tallies showed that González had won by a landslide.\\nAfter her Peace Prize win was announced in October, Machado made a point to praise US President Donald Trump, who is open about his own ambitions for the Peace Prize and is locked in ongoing military tension with Venezuela.\\nOn Wednesday, he announced the US military had seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a sharp escalation in Washington\\'s pressure campaign against Maduro\\'s government.\\nThe Trump administration alleges the vessel was under sanction and was involved in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\".\\nThe Venezuelan government accused the US of theft and piracy.\\n'},\n",

Singer-songwriter Harleymoon is the free-spirited adventure-seeker who is usually the last to leave any party.\\nBroadcaster Roman, devoted to his work and his beloved Arsenal, is naturally cautious about stepping outside his comfort zone.\\nFor them, the race was an opportunity to become friends again and help them discover new sides of each other.\\nRoman and Harleymoon describe their time with a family on Panama\\'s San Blas Islands as truly transformative.\\nRoman says the race \"took me so far from where I am from\".\\n\"It was the biggest moment for me.\\n\"It does make you realise that there\\'s so much more to life… You see what makes these people happy and how happy they really are, which is just this family.\"\\nHe said it also taught him what a tough duo they are: \"We\\'ve proved that we can do something together that\\'s really hard.\"\\nRoman says in hindsight he\\'d have spent more money, but being the children of Spandau Ballet\\'s Martin Kemp and singer Shirlie Holliman made him worry about how that would be perceieved.\\n\"Harley and I are considered classic nepo kids, and I didn\\'t want to run out and people think that we didn\\'t know the value of money.\"\\nFor Harleymoon, the experience of having nothing besides a few bananas and a hammock \"in the middle of nowhere\" sparked deep self-reflection.\\n\"Your life has turned into something so simple but so beautiful — it\\'s an amazing window to reflect and think, wow, we have so much at home, and yet we always strive for more,\" she said.\\n\"Getting to experience days like that, when you\\'re just so full of gratitude, was really amazing.\"\\nIn the lead-up to the race, Tyler West and Molly Rainford had a flicker of apprehension.\\nWhile the couple knew each others\\' strengths and weaknesses inside out, life in the public eye often left them feeling like \"passing ships in the night.\"\\nTheir occasional holidays tended to have a single goal: complete relaxation.\\nThis challenge offered something entirely different: a chance to push their relationship into new territory, and to reconnect without the usual distractions – for presenter and DJ Tyler, that meant not even his beloved Biscoff biscuits.\\n\"It was a big question mark in our minds whether we\\'d even make it to the first checkpoint,\" Tyler admits.\\n\"I remember looking at the final checkpoint on the map and thinking, \\'How on earth are we going to get there?\\' But reaching this far really puts things into perspective - we\\'re not as bad at travelling as we thought.\"\\nFor actor and singer Molly, one of the biggest takeaways is a new-found confidence.\\n\"Talking to strangers, asking people for help - those are things you just don\\'t do anymore, but the race forces you into it,\" she says.\\n\"It\\'s given me so much more confidence that now I\\'m thinking, \\'What have I got to lose?\\'\"\\nAnd as for their relationship? \"It proved to us we can get through anything together,\" she says.\\nFor actor Dylan Llewellyn and his mother Jackie, the race was less about crossing the finish line first and more about getting out of their comfort zone.\\nAfter three decades of marriage, Jackie had never been away from her husband for more than a weekend. But she filled the freezer with steak-and-kidney pies and set off with her son, determined to embrace the unknown.\\nThey learned lessons from past contestants: save more, spend less, and never - under any circumstances - let go of your moneybelt or passport.\\n\"I can\\'t believe we\\'ve got this far. I thought we wouldn\\'t make it after leg one,\" says Jackie.\\n\"I\\'m so pleased that we pushed ourselves through the lows, and I\\'m proud of us both for getting to the end of leg five.\"\\nThe pair leaned on each other during the toughest moments but also learned the importance of asking for help.\\n\"I don\\'t think we realise how much kindness there is out there. And we felt it a lot,\" says Dylan.\\n\"We felt so much love and togetherness with families and it was really strong and beautiful to see.\"\\nBefore the race began, broadcaster and writer Anita Rani and her father, Bal, were excited at the idea of five uninterrupted weeks in each others\\' company. They hadn\\'t travelled together since a family trip to India when Anita was just two years old.\\nAs the oldest combined duo in the competition, they worried initially whether they would have the stamina to keep pace with younger teams.\\nBut they know they have what matters most: determination.\\n\"We\\'re never going to quit,\" Anita insists ahead of the final.\\n\"There\\'s obviously been disappointment so far about the things that have been out of our control, but there\\'s a life lesson in that, isn\\'t there?\\n\"When Guatemala closed down, we missed a bus, or whatever, all those things are completely out of your control, and it\\'s very frustrating, but that\\'s part of the journey.\"\\nFor Anita and Bal, the race has become about far more than reaching the finish line.\\nThey have treasured the time together and the chance to get to know each other better.\\n\"Honestly, this is life, and this is what we\\'ve been through,\" Anita says.\\n\"I think my dad has seen a more vulnerable side of me that I don\\'t normally show.\"\\n'},\n",

We are returning to ourselves. We are returning home.\"\\nThe audience in City Hall, which included members of Norway\\'s royal family, gave Ms Sosa a long round of applause and a standing ovation.\\nThere had been much speculation about whether Machado would be able to defy a travel ban to attend the ceremony. In an audio recording shared by the Nobel Institute, she said: \"I will be in Oslo, I am on my way.\"\\nHowever, the director of the institute, Kristian Berg Harpviken, said Machado was expected to arrive \"sometime between this evening and tomorrow morning\" - too late for the ceremony.\\nEarlier on Wednesday, the institute had said they were in the dark about her whereabouts, triggering concern among supporters.\\nAs well as her daughter Ana, Machado\\'s two other children, her mother and her three sisters are all in Oslo waiting to be reunited with her.\\nThe last time she was seen in public was on 9 January when she spoke to her supporters at a rally protesting against the swearing-in of Nicolás Maduro to a third term as president.\\nThe elections were widely dismissed both by the opposition in Venezuela and on the international stage as rigged, and sparked protests across the country.\\nAround 2,000 people were arrested in the crackdown which followed, among them many members of her opposition coalition.\\nMachado, who had managed to unite the bitterly divided opposition ahead of the election, went into hiding for fear of arrest.\\nShe continued to give interviews and uploaded videos to social media urging her followers not to give up.\\nHer Nobel Peace Prize win galvanised supporters and triggered immediate speculation as to whether she would be able to travel to Oslo.\\nTotal secrecy has surrounded her travel plans and it is not known how she managed to leave her place of hiding or by what means she has reached Europe.\\nSpeaking before she left Venezuela, Machado she told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK: \"I want to assure every single Venezuelan that I will be back.\"\\n\\nOn the streets of the capital Caracas, though, there were some who worried that it might not be easy for her to get back into Venezuela.\\nMaria, 66, told the BBC she feared that without Machado, her supporters would be \"left unprotected\".\\n\"The problem for her will be returning later,\" María explained, adding that her own grandchildren were outside the country \"precisely because of the problems we have\".\\nWhen the Nobel Committee awarded her the peace prize, it highlighted her \"civilian courage\", noting that \"despite serious threats against her life\" she had remained in the country, a choice which the committee said \"inspired millions\".\\nCarlos, 49, said he hoped Machado would return after visiting Norway.\\n\"I think it\\'s better for her to be here, inside. Since everyone has left and hasn\\'t done anything. It\\'s best for her to be here inside Venezuela,\" he said, criticising opposition leaders who have gone into exile.\\nMachado\\'s Nobel Peace Prize comes at a time of high tension between Maduro and the United States.\\nThe US has deployed warships to international waters off Venezuela and Donald Trump has been ramping up pressure on Maduro, reportedly giving him an ultimatum to leave Venezuela.\\nThe US has also been carrying out strikes on boats in the Caribbean, accusing the alleged traffickers who are piloting them of trying to carry drugs from Venezuela to the US. Dozens of people have been killed in the controversial months-long campaign.\\nAfter Machado was told that she had won the peace prize back in October, she spoke on the phone to Trump, who has made no secret of wanting to win the accolade himself.\\nMachado told the BBC that in the call she stressed \"how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he\\'s doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy\".\\nQuizzed about the call by reporters, Trump said that \"I\\'ve been helping her along the way\" and described Machado as \"very nice\".\\nMachado also appeared to back the US strikes on boats in the Caribbean - the legality of which has been questioned by experts on international law. She told the BBC that \"when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls\".\\n'},\n",

Experts have raised questions over the legality of the strikes, which have killed more than 80 people.\\nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of using the strikes to destabilise the country and oust him from power.\\nIn an interview conducted with Politico the day before the jets approached Venezuela\\'s coastline, Trump declared that Maduro\\'s days in power were \"numbered\", and declined to comment on whether US troops could be deployed to the country.\\nA separate jet, an EA-18G Growler, also appeared just before the F/A-18s on the tracking site FlightRadar24. Data shows the jet flew loops just north of Venezuela\\'s coast.\\nThey are the latest in a number of unusual US air force activities that have been tracked since September. B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers previously flew up to and along the Venezuelan coast.\\nBut the F/A-18s, which are capable of engaging targets both on the ground and in the air, appear to be the first to approach the Venezuelan coastline so publicly in recent months. The F/A-18s came within 20 nautical miles of the coastline, flight tracking data showed, but the US official said the jets remained in international airspace.\\nNeither the F/A-18s or the Growler showed a point of origin or a destination on FlightRadar24, and all three aircraft only turned on their transponders when they arrived near the Venezuelan coastline. Justin Crump, head of the risk consultancy Sibylline, suggested the move was intended to \"support the administration\\'s signalling and put pressure on the [Venezuelan] leadership\".\\nThe F/A-18s - which operated under the callsigns RHINO11 and RHINO12 - flew six loops up and down the Gulf of Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Growler jet - flying under the codename GRIZZLY2 - also flew circles along the coast.\\nGreg Bagwell, a former RAF air marshal and president of the Air and Space Power Association, told BBC Verify that the flights appeared to be \"probing\" Venezuelan defence and trying to check for responses such as radio traffic and encrypted signals related to defence systems.\\n\"The Growlers would have been listening for [signals intelligence], whilst the Super Hornets would have been providing air defence cover for the Growlers,\" Baswell said. He said the Growlers would also detect \"active missile sites\".\\n\"It could be construed as the early gathering of intelligence for subsequent operations, or just a warning of such,\" he added.\\nCrump said the jets also had the capacity to test out \"jamming capabilities\", adding: \"This also helps send a message, when successful, potentially indicating to Venezuela\\'s leadership that these systems cannot or should not be relied upon,\" he said.\\nThe US has deployed troops, ships and jets to the Caribbean in recent months, which officials have said is to combat drug trafficking in the area.\\nOn Tuesday the US Southern Command published photos of an F/A-18 operating from the USS Gerald Ford, the world\\'s largest aircraft carrier, which has been sent to the Caribbean.\\nAnalysis of satellite images and ship tracking websites by BBC Verify has made it possible to identify at least nine military vessels that have been deployed to the region over recent weeks.\\nSatellite images also show that an airbase in Puerto Rico, which was closed in 2004 by the Pentagon, has been re-activated. Repairs have been carried out to the runway at Roosevelt Roads base and F-35s - America\\'s most advanced fighter - have been sent to the base.\\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The US has criticised the Venezuelan government over the death of an opposition figure in custody, calling it a \"reminder of the vile nature\" of President Nicolás Maduro\\'s regime.\\nAlfredo Díaz died in his prison cell at the El Helicoide prison in Caracas where he was being held for more than a year, human rights organisations and opposition groups have said.\\nThe Venezuelan government said the 56-year-old showed signs of a heart attack and was taken to hospital, where he died on Saturday.\\nThe US intervention is the latest in an escalating war of words between the Trump administration and Maduro, who has accused it of seeking regime change.\\nIn recent months, the US has increased its military presence in the region and has carried out a series of deadly strikes on boats it says have been used for smuggling drugs.\\nUS President Donald Trump has accused Maduro himself of being the head of one of the region\\'s drug cartels - an allegation the Venezuelan president vehemently denies - and threatened military action \"by land\".\\nWhy is Trump threatening Venezuela\\'s Maduro?\\nThe US State Department\\'s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said Díaz had been \"arbitrarily detained\" in a \"torture centre\".\\nDíaz was detained in 2024 after being among many opposition figures to dispute the results of that year\\'s presidential election.\\nVenezuela\\'s government-controlled election council declared Maduro the winner, despite opposition tallies showing their candidate had won by a landslide.\\nThe elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.\\nDíaz, the former governor of the Nueva Esparta state, a collection of islands off Venezuela\\'s Caribbean coastline, was accused of \"incitement to hatred\" and \"terrorism\" for questioning Maduro\\'s claim to victory.\\nThe Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal has raised concerns over deteriorating conditions for political prisoners in the Latin American nation.\\n\"Another political prisoner has died in Venezuelan jails. He had been imprisoned for a year, in solitary confinement,\" Alfredo Romero, the organisation\\'s president, wrote on X.\\nHe said that Díaz had only been allowed one visit from his daughter during the entire length of his incarceration. He added that 17 political prisoners have died in the country since 2014.\\nOpposition groups have also criticised the government over the death of Diaz.\\nMaría Corina Machado, a prominent opposition leader who won this year\\'s Nobel Peace Prize but who remains in hiding to avoid arrest, said Díaz\\'s death was not an isolated incident.\\n\"Sadly, it adds to an alarming and painful chain of deaths of political prisoners detained in the context of the post-election repression,\" she wrote on X.\\nMachado, a vocal critic of Maduro\\'s government who was integral to galvanising the opposition against him, will likely be absent from the Nobel Prize-giving ceremony in Oslo on Wednesday. Venezuela\\'s attorney general said last month that she would be considered a \"fugitive\" if she travelled to Norway.\\nThe Democratic Unitary Platform, an opposition alliance, said Díaz \"died unjustly\".\\nDiaz\\'s own political party, Democratic Action (AD), also paid tribute to the former governor, saying he had been unjustly detained without due process and had remained in conditions \"that should never have violated his fundamental rights\".\\nTensions between the US and Venezuela have become increasingly strained over what Trump has described as efforts to stem the flow of drugs and migrants into the US.\\nUS air strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific have killed more than 80 people.\\nTrump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" into the US, and designated two Venezuelan drug cartels - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as terrorist organisations, the latter of which Trump alleged Maduro led.\\nMaduro has in turn accused the US of using its war on drugs as an excuse to depose his socialist government and get its hands on Venezuela\\'s vast oil reserves. Colombia\\'s left-wing President Gustavo Petro has said the US strikes were an attempt to \"dominate\" Latin America.\\nThe US has also stationed a large naval force - its largest deployment in the region in decades - along with thousands of troops.\\nThe Venezuelan army reportedly swore in more than 5,600 soldiers in one go on Saturday, in response to what military leaders called US \"threats\".\\nThe same day, the Venezuelan government said that Maduro and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had agreed to resume Turkish Airlines flights between the two nations.\\nThe carrier was one of six major international airlines to have their landing licences revoked after temporarily suspending flights to Caracas over a US warning of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Questions are mounting over the legality of a wave of US strikes on alleged \"drug boats\" in the Caribbean Sea, which have killed more than 80 people since September.\\nPresident Donald Trump has said the strikes are targeting so-called \"narco-terrorists\" transporting drugs from Venezuela to the US run by the Tren de Aragua cartel.\\nSimilar announcements have followed in recent weeks, accompanied by grainy footage of the strikes, but the US has provided no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking and few details about who or what was on board each vessel.\\nUS officials said they are acting in self-defence but the strikes have attracted condemnation in the region. In one case, the Colombian president said a boat hit by the US was not Venezuelan, but \"Colombian with Colombian citizens inside\" - which the White House denied.\\nUN experts have warned that the \"systemic\" nature of the strikes \"raise serious concerns about the commission of potential international crimes\".\\nBBC Verify spoke to a range of experts in international and maritime law after the first strike. Several said the US may have acted illegally by attacking the vessel.\\nThe US is not a signatory to United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but the US military\\'s legal advisors have previously said that the US should \"act in a manner consistent with its provisions\".\\nUnder the convention, countries agree not to interfere with vessels operating in international waters. There are limited exceptions to this which allow a state to seize a ship, such as a \"hot pursuit\" where a vessel is chased from a country\\'s waters into the high seas.\\n\"Force can be used to stop a boat but generally this should be non-lethal measures,\" Prof Luke Moffett of Queens University Belfast said.\\nProf Moffett added that the use of aggressive tactics must be \"reasonable and necessary in self-defence where there is immediate threat of serious injury or loss of life to enforcement officials\", noting that the US moves were likely \"unlawful under the law of the sea\".\\nExperts have also questioned whether the killing of the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua cartel could contravene international law on the use of force.\\nUnder Article 2(4) of the UN charter, countries can resort to force when under attack and deploying their military in self-defence. Trump has previously accused the Tren de Aragua cartel of conducting irregular warfare against the US, and the state department has designated the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.\\nAfter the first strike, Prof Michael Becker of Trinity College Dublin told BBC Verify that the American action \"stretches the meaning of the term beyond its breaking point\".\\n\"The fact that US officials describe the individuals killed by the US strike as narco-terrorists does not transform them into lawful military targets,\" Prof Becker said. \"The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela or the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation.\"\\nProf Moffett added: \"Labelling everyone a terrorist does not make them a lawful target and enables states to side-step international law.\"\\nA memo sent to the US Congress, which was leaked, reportedly said the Trump administration had determined the US was in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels.\\nResponding to a fifth strike in October, Notre Dame Law School Prof Mary Ellen O\\'Connell told BBC Verify that \"no credible facts or legal principles have come to light to justify these attacks\".\\n\"The only relevant law for peace is international law - that is the law of treaties, human rights and statehood,\" Prof O\\'Connell wrote in an emailed statement.\\nBut US officials including Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth have defended the action, which has also been applauded by Republicans in Congress.\\nAsked about the same strike, a White House official told BBC Verify that Trump had authorised it after the boat left Venezuela crewed by Tren de Aragua members. The official added that the president was committed to using all means to prevent drugs reaching the US.\\nThe Pentagon declined to share the legal advice it obtained before carrying out the strike.\\nIn one strike, carried out on 16 October, there were two survivors - a Colombian and an Ecuadorian, who the US government says were repatriated for \"detention and prosecution\".\\nUS officials have also faced scrutiny over a follow-up strike - or \"double-tap\" - on 2 September.\\nQuestions have also been raised as to whether the White House complied with US law in authorising the strikes. The US constitution says that only Congress has the power to declare war.\\nHowever, Article II - which lays out the president\\'s powers - says that \"the president shall be Commander in Chief of the Army\" and some constitutional experts have suggested that this grants the president the power to authorise strikes against military targets. Trump administration sources have previously cited this provision when defending US strikes on Iran.\\nBut it is unclear whether that provision extends to the use of force against non-state actors such as drug cartels.\\nRumen Cholakov, an expert in US constitutional law at King\\'s College London, told BBC Verify that since 9/11, US presidents have relied on the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military Force Act (AUMF) when carrying out strikes against groups responsible for the attacks.\\n\"Its scope has been expanded consistently in subsequent administrations,\" he added. \"It is not immediately obvious that drug cartels such as Tren de Aragua would be within the President\\'s AUMF powers, but that might be what \\'narco-terrorists\\' is hinting at.\"\\nQuestions also remain as to whether Trump complied with the War Powers Resolution, which demands that the president \"in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities\".\\nDespite some Republicans in Congress reportedly challenging the strikes, the Senate defeated a resolution in October that would have required the Trump administration to seek the approval of Congress before any further attacks.\\nVenezuela\\'s government has reacted to the strikes with anger. Its president, Nicolas Maduro, denies American accusations that he is involved with drugs trafficking.\\nThe strikes come amid reports that the US has deployed naval warships to the region in support of anti-narcotics operations against Venezuela.\\nUsing satellite imagery, images from social media, and information from publicly available trackers on vessels, we\\'ve identified 14 US military ships in the region.\\nThese include guided missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships.\\nWe also located a number of military planes and drones in Puerto Rico.\\nTrump also acknowledged in October that he has authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela.\\nThe president - who has long sought to oust Maduro - has authorised a US$50m reward for any information leading to his arrest. The Venezuelan leader claimed victory in last year\\'s elections, widely viewed as rigged by international observers.\\nAdditional reporting by Lucy Gilder\\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\\n'},\n",

That is a lack of respect,\" he says in a coffee shop in Tegucigalpa.\\n\"Donald Trump saying who we should elect violates our autonomy as a nation, and it affects our elections as well.\"\\nIrrespective of whether the National Party go on to victory, one of their key figures is already celebrating.\\nOn Monday, ex-President Juan Orlando Hernández walked out of jail in Virginia a free man having served just one year of a 45-year sentence for drug-smuggling and weapons charges.\\nHis release came after Trump urged Honduran voters to cast their ballots for Asfura.\\nHernández was unexpectedly pardoned by Trump, despite having been found guilty last year by a court in New York of running a drug conspiracy which had brought more than 400 tonnes of cocaine into the United States.\\nHis time in office had also been marred by allegations of serious human rights violations by the police and security forces, particularly against government critics.\\nSo, when Hernández was arrested in 2022, then extradited to the United States and eventually jailed, most Hondurans celebrated it as a rare moment of justice in a nation riddled with institutional impunity, especially for the political elites.\\nTrump has claimed the opposite, telling journalists on Air Force One that \"the people of Honduras really thought (Juan Orlando Hernández) was set up and it was a terrible thing\".\\nJournalists in Honduras who have covered the rise and fall of Hernández – from the moment he rose to national prominence following a coup in 2009 to his extradition – struggle to recognise that description of a roundly detested former president.\\nHowever, he does still have his supporters, particularly in the National Party. And none have been more vocal in maintaining his innocence or calling for his pardon than his wife, Ana García Carías.\\nI sat down with the former First Lady, who described Hernández\\'s release as \"like being in a dream, a dream made reality\".\\n\"We spoke to him this morning (Tuesday) and he is in a safe place. We were so happy, we got all the children onto the phone together with my mother-in-law, and shared a moment of happiness, laughter and prayer together.\"\\nIn terms of the future, the question now arises as to whether Hernández will attempt to return to Honduras. Ms García Carías says that his potential return depends less on the outcome of the election and more on whether the authorities will guarantee his safety.\\n\"It depends on the security guarantees they give him in this country,\" she says.\\n\"Day after day, this government – which thank God is on its way out – used a discourse of hate about my husband that they spoke of persecution against him. And that\\'s very dangerous for an ex-president – to return to a place where they\\'ve cultivated hatred against him from the very top, the president, down to the lowliest functionary.\"\\nMs García Carías alleged her husband had been a victim of \"lawfare\", of \"the deep state\" and of a \"politically motivated witch-hunt\" by the Biden administration. I put it to her that the case against her husband had largely been drawn up by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the US Department of Justice during Trump\\'s first term, not President Biden\\'s.\\nIt was a point she quickly dismissed.\\n\"That\\'s what the prosecutors claimed but I think it\\'s so illogical,\" she argues. \"In whose mind would it make sense to bring a man they say was a co-conspirator into meetings with the CIA, the DEA, to give classified information on national security?\"\\n\"There was a political campaign (against him) involving figures in the Biden administration,\" she insisted, \"and I think there was manipulation of the facts after the event.\"\\nMs García Carías publicly recognised the role of two key MAGA figures in securing her husband\\'s pardon: the influential conservative political advisor Roger Stone – himself the beneficiary of a Trump pardon – and the former Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz.\\n\"They both got involved with the case,\" she says. \"I recognise and thank them for their contribution. In fact, I spoke to Mr Stone on his radio programme on Sunday and he said that he had taken a letter from Juan Orlando, which he had written on his birthday to ask for a pardon and delivered it directly to President Trump.\"\\nMeanwhile, the vote count in Honduras carries on into another night.\\nAs the ballots continue to be tallied, it should soon become clear whether Trump will get his way in Honduras and see a new ally elected in the country just as he pardons an old one.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez found himself in the right place at the right time.\\nWhen his father moved their family-owned tyre repair shop to the rural Argentine town of Añelo, it was a small, sleepy place, some 1,000km (600 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires.\\nThere was no mains water or gas, and the electricity supply was constantly being cut off.\\nThen in 2014, fracking for oil and gas started in the surrounding region, and the conurbation boomed.\\n\"We set up the tyre repair shop in the middle of the sand dunes, far from the town centre,\" says Mr Jiménez. \"Then the town grew and passed us by.\"\\nFuelled by its new-found energy wealth, Añelo\\'s population soared from 10,788 in 2010 to 17,893 in 2022, an increase of more than 60%.\\nIn addition to these people who are already permanently settled in Añelo, there are some 15,000 industry workers who sleep in the city every night.\\nThis has made the roads very busy, including lots of oil tankers going through.\\nLast year, 24,956 vehicles entered the town every day, of which 6,400 were lorries, official figures showed. Mr Jiménez\\'s workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres.\\nAñelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn\\'t until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed.\\nFracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface.\\nThe first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina\\'s majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron.\\nBy February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas.\\nThis accounts \"for more than half of Argentina\\'s oil and gas production\", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official.\\nHe adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to.\\nNicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. \"We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,\" he says. \"All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta.\"\\nThe oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency.\\n\"Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],\" says Mr Gadano. \"This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices.\"\\nMr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports \"is very important\" for the country, \"especially when two or three years ago we were in the red\". Yet he adds that it won\\'t be \"the panacea\" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt.\\n\"I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,\" he says.\\n\"However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind.\"\\nOther commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina\\'s bad credit rating is putting off international investors.\\nThey also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank.\\n\"Companies say \\'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven\\'t been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force\\',\" explains Mr Gadano. \"That\\'s not how the world works, that\\'s not how companies work, especially the big international players.\"\\nThe government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party\\'s victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted.\\nOther critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection.\\nGustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government \"is doing what it has to do and what it can do\".\\nWhat continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. \"All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,\" notes Mr Gadano.\\nThis consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns.\\n\"We are really losing in the public debate,\" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. \"There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic.\"\\nBack at Mr Jiménez\\'s garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. \"When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day.\"\\nYet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country\\'s problems. \"Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The US appears poised to strike Iran.\\nFor weeks, Washington has been building up its forces in the Middle East - and now looks set to assemble more air power in the region than at any time since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\\nThis could, of course, still be a bluff designed to pressure the Iranian regime into a deal they do not want to make. America\\'s Gulf Arab allies are known to have cautioned against a US attack that could have unintended results.\\nSo while the potential targets of a US attack are largely predictable, the outcome is not.\\nIf negotiations fail and President Donald Trump decides to order an attack, then what are the possible outcomes?\\nUS air and naval forces conduct limited, precision strikes targeting military bases of Iran\\'s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and the Basij unit - a paramilitary force under the control of the IRGC - ballistic missile launch and storage sites as well as Iran\\'s nuclear programme.\\nAn already weakened regime is toppled, transitioning eventually to a genuine democracy where Iran can rejoin the rest of the world.\\nThis is a highly optimistic scenario. Western military intervention in both Iraq and Libya did not bring a smooth transition to democracy. Although it ended brutal dictatorships in both cases, it ushered in years of chaos and bloodshed.\\nTrump says world has 10 days to see if Iran deal reached\\nCan the US help Iran? What Iranians say - inside and outside the country\\nUS build-up of warships and fighter jets tracked near Iran\\n\\'We all know someone who was killed\\' - Iran protesters tell BBC of brutal crackdown\\nThis could broadly be called the \"Venezuelan model\" whereby swift, powerful US action leaves the regime intact but with its policies moderated.\\nIn Iran\\'s case, this would mean the Islamic Republic survived, which won\\'t satisfy large numbers of Iranians, but is forced to curtail its support for violent militias across the Middle East, cease or curtail its domestic nuclear and ballistic missile programmes as well as easing up on its suppression of protests.\\nAgain, this is at the more unlikely end of the scale.\\nThe Islamic Republic leadership has remained defiant and resistant to change for 47 years. It appears incapable of changing course now. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, now well into his 80s, is especially resistant to change or compromise.\\nMany think this is the most likely possible outcome.\\nWhile the regime is clearly unpopular with many, and each successive wave of protests over the years weakens it further, there remains a huge and pervasive security deep state with a vested interest in the status quo. The IRGC, for example, is deeply involved in Iran\\'s economy.\\nThe principal reasons why the protests have so far failed to overthrow the regime is because there have been no significant defections to their side, while those in control are prepared to use unlimited force and brutality to remain in power.\\nIn the confusion of the aftermath of any US strikes it is conceivable that Iran ends up being ruled by a strong, military government composed largely of IRGC figures.\\nThis is highly likely.\\nIran vowed last month to retaliate against any US attack, saying that \"its finger is on the trigger\" and Ayatollah Khamenei promised to deliver \"a slap in the face\" to US forces if attacked.\\nIran is clearly no match for the might of the US Navy and Air Force but it could still lash out with its arsenal of ballistic missiles and drones, many concealed in caves, underground or in remote mountainsides.\\nThere are US bases and facilities dotted along the Arabian side of the Gulf, notably in Bahrain and Qatar, but Iran could also, if it chose, target some of the critical infrastructure of any nation it considered was complicit in a US attack, such as Jordan or Israel.\\nThe devastating missile and drone attack on Saudi Aramco\\'s petrochemical facilities in 2019, attributed to an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq, showed the Saudis just how vulnerable they were to Iranian missiles.\\nIran\\'s Gulf Arab neighbours, all US allies, are understandably extremely jittery right now that any US military action is going to end up rebounding on them.\\nLast month, Saudi Arabia and the UAE said that they would not allow the US to use their airspace for any attack. That may not necessarily spare them from Iranian retaliation.\\nThis has long loomed as a potential threat to global shipping and oil supplies ever since the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88 when Iran did indeed mine the shipping lanes and Royal Navy minesweepers helped clear them.\\nThe narrow Strait of Hormuz between Iran and Oman is a critical chokepoint. Around 20% of the world\\'s Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) exports and between 20-25% of oil and oil byproducts pass through this strait each year.\\nAs talks over a US-Iran deal took place in Geneva earlier this week, Iran closed the Strait for a few hours to conduct live fire drills - the first time it\\'s been closed since the 1980s, and a symbolic show of force.\\nOn Thursday, it reportedly carried out military drills alongside Russian sailors in the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean.\\nAnd it\\'s also conducted exercises in rapidly deploying sea mines. If it did so again then it would inevitably impact world trade and oil prices. The biggest losers in this scenario would be Iran itself, as it relies on oil exports for revenue, and its principle customers in Asia, notably China.\\nA US Navy Captain onboard a warship in the Gulf once told me that one of the threats from Iran he worries about most is a \"swarm attack\".\\nThis is where Iran launches so many high explosive drones and fast torpedo boats at a single or multiple targets that even the US Navy\\'s formidable close-in defences are unable to eliminate all of them in time.\\nThe IRGC Navy has long replaced the conventional Iranian Navy in the Gulf, some of whose commanders were even trained at Dartmouth during the time of the Shah.\\nIran\\'s naval crews have focussed much of their training on unconventional or \"asymmetric\" warfare, looking at ways to overcome or bypass the technical advantages enjoyed by their primary adversary, the US Navy\\'s Fifth Fleet.\\nThe sinking of a US warship, accompanied by the possible capture of survivors among its crew, would be a massive humiliation for the US.\\nWhile this scenario is thought unlikely, the billion-dollar destroyer the USS Cole was crippled by an Al-Qaeda suicide attack in Aden harbour in 2000, killing 17 US sailors.\\nBefore that, in 1987 an Iraqi jet pilot mistakenly fired two Exocet missiles at a US warship, the USS Stark, in the Gulf killing 37 sailors.\\nThe US is set to have two carrier strike groups in the region when the USS Gerald R Ford - which is currently transiting the Mediterranean - arrives in the coming weeks.\\nThis is a very real danger and is one of the major concerns of neighbours like Qatar and Saudi Arabia.\\nAs well as the possibility of a civil war, such as experienced by Syria, Yemen and Libya, there is also the risk that in the chaos and confusion, ethnic tensions could spill over into armed conflict as Kurds, Baluchis, Azerbaijanis and other minorities look to safeguard their own people amid a nationwide power vacuum.\\nMuch of the Middle East would certainly be glad to see the back of the Islamic Republic, none more so than Israel which has already dealt heavy blows to Iran\\'s proxies across the region and which fears an existential threat from Iran\\'s suspected nuclear programme.\\nBut nobody wants to see the largest Middle East nation by population - around 93 million - descend into chaos, sparking a humanitarian and refugee crisis.\\nThe greatest danger now is that President Trump, having amassed this powerful force close to Iran\\'s borders, decides he must act or lose face, and a war begins with no clear end-state and with unpredictable and potentially damaging repercussions.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Several countries which have signed up to Donald Trump\\'s Board of Peace have contributed more than $7bn (£5.2bn) towards a Gaza \"relief package\", the US president has said.\\nTrump made the announcement during the first meeting of the organisation that many of US\\'s Western allies have refused to join, fearing the body originally meant to help end the war between Israel and Hamas may be intended to replace the UN.\\nThe second phase of a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan includes the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza.\\nIt \"looks like\" Hamas would disarm, Trump told participants. However, there are few signs of the Palestinian group disarming. Gazans say it is extending its control over the Strip.\\nSpeaking as the Board of Peace convened on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had \"agreed with our ally the US there will be no reconstruction of Gaza before the demilitarisation of Gaza\".\\nThe war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\\nIsrael responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 72,000 people have been killed, according to the territory\\'s Hamas-run health ministry.\\nThe enclave\\'s economy is in ruins, with its buildings and infrastructure largely destroyed. The UN estimates the cost of damage at $70bn.\\nCountries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany have refused to join the Board of Peace that came into being last month.\\nIn an effort to address concerns that the organisation was meant as a way of sidelining the UN, Trump told the board\\'s first meeting in Washington that \"we\\'re going to be working with the United Nations very closely, we\\'re going to bring them back\".\\nGaza, the US president said, was \"no longer a hotbed of radicalism and terror\".\\n\"And to end that, we have today, and I\\'m pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7bn toward the relief package\".\\n\"Every dollar spent is an investment in stability,\" he said, adding that the UN would contribute $2bn for humanitarian assistance, while football body Fifa would raise $75m for soccer-related projects in the Strip.\\nNickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician who has been given the title of high representative for Gaza as part of the board, said the process of recruiting a new transitional Palestinian police force had begun and \"just in the first few hours we have 2,000 people who have applied\".\\nBut both Israel and the US have insisted that the force is not drawn from the existing Hamas-controlled police without stringent vetting, nor do they want it simply made up of the security forces of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.\\nThat means starting from scratch, and the task is daunting.\\nMladenov has previously said the Palestinian police force must be the primary security agency in Gaza, assisted by the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), and not vice-versa.\\nAccording to the US plan, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.\\nBut Mladenov said there is little evidence such a force could yet oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian factions.\\nMeanwhile, there was no indication at the meeting that Hamas was prepared to hand over its weapons, despite Trump\\'s combination of optimism and threat on this point.\\nSo far, Hamas has publicly appeared to make handing over weapons contingent on - at least - Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\\nProgress on this issue is critical because none of Trump\\'s proposals for reconstruction and governance can take place without a security force on the ground that has broad backing of the Palestinian population, given its role includes assuming a monopoly of force within Gaza.\\nThe Washington meeting itself was characteristic of Trump\\'s approach to Israeli-Palestinian peace-making over his two terms - involving a future for Palestinians seen often through the lens of real-estate development and wealthy investor funding.\\nMeanwhile Israel\\'s leadership has been wary about some of Trump\\'s efforts, particularly the invitations to his board for Turkey and Qatar, whom Israel does not want to see take a prominent role in decisions on the future of Gaza.\\nTrump and his team have defended his unconventional approach saying it amounts to \"new thinking\" to try to solve the conflict.\\nHowever, Mladenov has warned that without rapid progress, Gaza will remain split into two territories, one under continuing Israeli occupation and the other under Hamas control - and also split from the West Bank, making a future independent state unviable and failing to secure either Palestinians or Israelis.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'When a US-imposed ceasefire halted the Gaza War last October, Hamas\\'s war for survival against Israel switched into a battle for control at home.\\nThe war had left the group\\'s disciplined military units shattered into guerrilla forces, and most of its leaders killed; Gaza\\'s buildings and infrastructure were largely destroyed, its population displaced, and its economic life in ruins. More than 72,000 Gazans were killed by Israeli attacks during the conflict, the Hamas-run health ministry says.\\nFour months on, Gazans say Hamas is again extending its control over security, tax revenue, and government services, raising questions about its long-term strategy, and whether it is prepared to give up its weapons and authority, as now required under the second stage of Donald Trump\\'s peace plan.\\n\"Hamas regained control of more than 90% of the areas where it is present,\" said Mohammed Diab, an activist in Gaza.\\n\"Its police and security agencies have returned, and are now present in the streets, controlling crime and pursuing those it labels as collaborators and people with opinions. Citizens must go to the Hamas authorities for identity cards or health procedures, and it is also reasserting control over the judiciary and courts.\"\\nAt markets across Gaza, stallholders describe regular police patrols – and a renewed iron grip on official fees and taxes.\\n\"The markets are quiet, but the municipality keeps pursuing us for rent,\" one stallholder said. All those we spoke to there about Hamas control in Gaza asked that we hide their identity.\\n\"Every single day they come to us aggressively, with the same demands and the same determination, saying if we don\\'t pay they\\'ll throw us and our goods into the street. They\\'re asking for 700 shekels ($225; £167) – none of us can afford that.\"\\nThe stallholder, who spoke to our colleague in Gaza City, said he and his family of 12 had been displaced from Shujaiya to the east of the city, where he used to run a shop. Shujaiya today is a flat wasteland of rubble.\\n\"Every day, the municipality comes,\" said another man selling cigarettes nearby. \"Let them count the stock and the sales, cigarette by cigarette, and tell me: should I pay them, or feed my children?\"\\nSince the ceasefire, food and some other basic goods are flowing into Gaza more freely. The few key traders with a licence to bring them in from Israel say Hamas have reimposed strict control over taxing the imports.\\nOne trader, who agreed to share details anonymously, told us force was used against those who refused to pay.\\n\"The taxes imposed by Hamas depend on the type and quantity of goods, but prices start at 20,000 shekels and above,\" he said. \"If a trader refuses to pay, force is used and in some cases he is kidnapped or threatened. No one can avoid paying taxes on goods.\"\\nHe told us that traders used a code-word for Hamas when discussing tax payments, so that Israel wouldn\\'t learn that money was being siphoned off to the group.\\n\"Hamas now has a database of all the traders who import goods into the Gaza Strip,\" said the activist Mohammed Diab. \"The trader pays in cash, not through bank transfers, so that the flow of funds cannot be traced. It is gradually restoring the system that was in place in the past, but away from the spotlight so it can\\'t be monitored.\"\\nA Hamas spokesman, Hazem Qassem, said the Gaza Strip was in a state of emergency and that \"exceptional measures\" were required.\\n\"Some traders maintain links with the [Israeli] occupation and attempt to generate excessive profits, so administrative bodies sometimes need to act firmly with traders who refuse to cooperate or meet required obligations,\" he said. \"This is purely a governmental matter and has no relation to Hamas.\"\\nGaza\\'s government has been run by Hamas since 2007. Money is crucial to the group\\'s grip on power: to pay salaries – and, the Israeli army alleges, for its ultimate goal of rebuilding its war machine.\\n\"Hamas looks at the ceasefire as a time to regroup, to fight against us,\" said Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). \"This is why it\\'s crucial to see them disarmed because they\\'ve made it clear that if they have weapons, they will use them sometime in the future.\"\\nThe Israeli army says there are daily attacks against its forces by Hamas. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire began.\\nHamas, in turn, points to repeated Israeli attacks, which Gaza\\'s Health Ministry says have killed 603 Palestinians.\\nThe IDF recently released grainy footage of several figures running through Gaza\\'s debris, who it identified as \"armed terrorists\" approaching troops in the area of Gaza temporarily controlled by Israel under Trump\\'s peace plan.\\nAsked whether two years of intense military conflict had failed to achieve the destruction of Hamas\\'s military capabilities - a key Israeli war goal – Lt Col Shoshani said the group had been heavily diminished, but was now trying to rebuild.\\n\"This war is not done until Hamas is disarmed,\" he said. \"There is an agreement now in place [and] we expect that to happen. If not, there are a lot of tools on the table to make sure that does happen.\"\\nTrump\\'s new Board of Peace, comprising the heads of state from many countries with a stake in Gaza\\'s future, will hold its first meeting in Washington on Thursday.\\nThe next stage of Trump\\'s plan for Gaza – including its reconstruction – hinges on Hamas disarmament, but negotiators are still inching through the detail of what the handover of weapons would mean in practice – who would Hamas hand weapons over to, which weapons would they hand over, and how would that be verified.\\n\"I believe we are capable of addressing the issue of weapons in a way that removes the Occupation\\'s pretext to renew the war and is also compatible with President Trump\\'s plan,\" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told the BBC.\\nBut Hamas, ideologically committed to fighting Israel, has a deeply-rooted and well-armed membership across the Gaza Strip. Verifying its full disarmament will be difficult, and some in the group have reportedly demanded they be allowed to keep personal weapons to defend themselves against enemies at home.\\nWhen the fighting with Israel stopped in October, Hamas immediately turned its guns on rival clans who had begun to take advantage of the chaos to extend their power in Gaza City, Rafah and elsewhere.\\nFootage of the crackdown, including summary executions of blindfolded rivals in the streets, was released to the public.\\nIsrael\\'s leaders have rejected the idea of Hamas keeping personal arms, and have applied pressure on the group to disarm by threatening a return to war.\\nIn the meantime, an International Stabilisation Force to take over security in Gaza remains in limbo, and the new Palestinian technocratic council meant to take over the running of Gaza\\'s civilian affairs is waiting in Egypt.\\nEarlier this month Hamas said it was ready to \"transfer authority and governance in all fields\" to the new technocratic council.\\nBut the Gaza activist, Mohammed Diab, said there were few signs that Hamas was preparing to hand over power.\\n\"On the contrary,\" he said, \"we heard last week that Hamas carried out large-scale appointments to vacant positions in the government sector, and announced them on social media and official platforms.\"\\nHazem Qassem denied any new government recruitment, saying that any appointments would have been technical, low-level positions that did not interfere with the handover of power.\\nCritics have questioned whether they are an attempt to retain influence inside any future Gaza administration.\\nThe recent transfer of medical cases out of Gaza through the newly-reopened Rafah Crossing also signalled the intention of Hamas to remain in control, despite the new process being designed without the group\\'s involvement.\\nOne of those present at an evacuation point run by international aid organisations near Nasser Hospital reported that Hamas ministry officials had shown up on the second day of evacuations to help supervise.\\nThis is now the make-or-break moment for Trump\\'s plan, which has so far kept on track by relentlessly pushing forward, past hiccups and delays.\\nDespite repeated threats of a return to renewed fighting if Hamas does not fully disarm, some in Israel believe the most effective pressure on Hamas leadership might actually come from moving forward with the plan without them.\\nGround has already been cleared in Israeli-held areas around Rafah, ahead of a reported US plan to build new housing facilities for some 200,000 Gazans, with the promise of food, water and medical support to tempt people across the yellow line from Hamas-controlled areas.\\nCrossing into the large swathe of Israeli-held territory around Gaza\\'s perimeter is seen by many in Gaza as siding with the enemy, and very few have so far made the journey.\\nBut Gaza\\'s population is a key source of Hamas\\'s revenue and control. After two years fighting Israel for control of the land, the battle for Gaza\\'s people might just be starting.\\nAdditional reporting by Rebecca Hartmann and Gaza colleagues\\n'},\n",

When I said Alawite, they began insulting the sect,\" she added.\\nRamia is one of dozens of women reported kidnapped since the fall of the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.\\nThe Syrian Feminist Lobby (SFL), an advocacy group for women\\'s rights, says it has recorded reports - from families, media and other sources - of more than 80 women who have gone missing. It says it has confirmed 26 of those cases to be kidnappings.\\nNearly all those reported missing are members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam that makes up about 10% of Syria\\'s population and to which the ousted president belongs.\\n\\nTwo Alawite women and the families of three others have shared details of abduction and assault with the BBC. All their names have been changed for reasons of privacy and safety.\\nAll of them said the interim government\\'s General Security Service - which is responsible for policing - had failed to investigate fully. One says its officers mocked her when she reported her ordeal.\\nThe interior ministry\\'s spokesman said in November that it had investigated 42 alleged kidnappings, and found all but one were \"false\". When contacted by the BBC, it said it had no further comment. However, a security source told the BBC that kidnappings had occurred, including some involving members of the security service, who he said had been dismissed.\\nThe kidnappings and disappearances recorded by the SFL span a period from February 2025 to early December. This is both before and after March, when more than 1,400 people, mostly Alawite civilians, were killed in sectarian violence in the western coastal regions. Forces loyal to the Sunni Islamist-led government were accused of a wave of revenge killings following a deadly ambush by Assad supporters.\\nMany members of the Assad regime\\'s elite were Alawites, but other members of the sect faced repression for opposing the former president.\\nRamia spoke quietly as she described being forced to wear a full body covering and niqab - a veil which leaves just the eye area exposed. She said she was locked in an underground room furnished with a bed and a dresser, on which lay toiletries and a condom.\\nHeld for two days, she tried to escape once and attempted suicide twice, she said.\\nHer captor did not speak Arabic fluently and had \"Asian features\", she said, adding that he removed her niqab and took photos.\\nA woman living in the same building, who said she was the captor\\'s wife, explained the photo \"was to determine her price for sale\", Ramia said.\\nShe said the woman told her \"many\" others had been kidnapped before her, and that some had been raped and released, while others had been \"sold\".\\nThe BBC could not verify any cases of money being exchanged for kidnapped women, but activists have reported cases where victims said they were threatened with being sold or forced into marriage.\\nNesma, a mother in her 30s, told the BBC she was taken from her village, also in Latakia province, and driven away in a van with curtained windows.\\nHer voice shook over the phone as she described being held for seven days in a room with high windows that appeared to be in an industrial facility, and interrogated by three men about the residents of her village and any links to the former regime.\\nShe said her captors were all masked and spoke in the Syrian Arabic dialect. She says they told her \"Alawite women were created to be sabaya\" - an archaic Arabic term meaning \"female captives\" and used by some Islamist extremists to refer to women treated as sex slaves.\\nHer captors raped her multiple times, she said: \"All I could think about was death - that I would die and leave my child without a mother.\"\\nLeen, another teenager, endured beatings, threats at gunpoint and daily sexual assault, her mother Hasna told the BBC.\\nHer captor kept his face covered, spoke poor Arabic and boasted about taking part in killings of Alawites during March\\'s violence, Hasna said.\\n\"He used to call our girls sabaya, because \\'they do not believe in God\\',\" Hasna says - some Sunni extremists consider Alawites to be heretics.\\nThe BBC also spoke to Ali, who said his wife Noor was kidnapped and held for several weeks, and a mother, Somaya, who said her teenage daughter was sexually assaulted \"for 10 consecutive days\".\\nNesma told the BBC that security officers treated her \"mockingly and disrespectfully\" when she went to tell them she had been kidnapped: \"They said to me \\'you should say you were on a picnic\\'.\"\\nRamia said officers initially seemed engaged with her case, but stopped taking her calls once they identified her captor. The family received threats by phone that they \"would pay a price if we talked\", she said. They decided to flee the country.\\nAli told the BBC: \"They arrested the kidnapper, but we don\\'t know what happened next.\" He said he was afraid the kidnapper may be released and \"will come after us\".\\nLeen\\'s mother said her daughter was interviewed \"with interest and sympathy\" several times by security officers, but that no results from investigations were shared, even after months. Somaya says she reported what happened, but received no updates.\\nIn November, Syria\\'s interior ministry, which oversees the General Security Service, held a press conference on its findings on 42 reported kidnappings.\\nSpokesperson Nour al-Din al-Baba said only one case was a \"genuine kidnapping\". He said the others were explained as \"voluntary elopement,\" \"staying with relatives or friends,\" \"fleeing domestic violence,\" \"false claims on social media\" or \"involvement in prostitution and extortion\", while four were \"criminal offences for which arrests were made\".\\nThe ministry dealt with such reports with \"utmost seriousness and responsibility\", he stressed.\\nLater in November, the BBC contacted the ministry for its response to the accounts we have gathered. It said it had no further comment.\\nA security source from a coastal area, speaking to the BBC on condition of anonymity, claimed: \"There are undisciplined actions by some elements who carry out temporary kidnappings for the purpose of financial extortion, or due to recklessness, or personal motives inherited from the time of the previous regime.\"\\nHe said this included members of the General Security Service. \"Some officers adopt the idea of kidnapping as a means of revenge,\" he said. \"Some cases have been uncovered, and the officers involved were immediately dismissed.\"\\nFour of the women and families who spoke to the BBC said they did not know who the kidnappers were. One did, and said it was not someone from the security services. Two said they were released after public pressure, the others said they did not know why they were freed.\\nIn July, Amnesty International said it had received credible reports of abductions and kidnappings of at least 36 Alawite women and girls, aged between three and 40, and had documented eight cases in detail.\\nIn \"almost all\" the cases it documented, families \"received no meaningful updates and no credible sense of progress on investigations,\" deputy regional director Kristine Beckerle told the BBC.\\nYamen Hussein, a Syrian human rights activist and writer based in Germany who has followed the issue, said survivors\\' accounts showed the kidnappings had an ideological basis \"built on the notion of violating the defeated side\", and aiming to \"spread fear among Alawite women\".\\nHowever, a \"general climate of impunity\" had also encouraged groups with no ideological motive to carry out kidnappings, he added.\\nAccording to the Syrian Feminist Lobby, a small number of Druze and Sunni women were reported kidnapped, but were released later. It says 16 women - all of them Alawite - are still missing.\\nFor the families the BBC spoke to, fear persists - both of retribution for speaking out and of social stigma associated with sexual assault.\\nLeen lives in constant anxiety, fearing knocks at the door, her mother said. Nesma\\'s marriage has collapsed. \"I would scream in my sleep,\" says Ramia. She says she is seeing a therapist but still struggles to sleep and \"can\\'t find comfort\".\\nAli told the BBC he and Noor were too afraid to seek justice, while Somaya said her daughter had returned to school, but \"nobody around me knows anything about what happened\".\\n\"We should not deny what happened to us but also we should not expose ourselves to danger,\" she said.\\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by the issues raised in this story, details of organisations offering information and support are available at BBC ActionLine.\\nThis is part of the Global Women series from the BBC World Service, sharing untold and important stories from around the globe\\n'},\n",

Other foreign governments have also refused to repatriate their citizens.\\nReuters news agency quoted a co-director of Roj camp as saying that the 34 Australians had been handed over to members of their families who had travelled to Syria for their release, and had boarded minibuses to travel to Damascus with a military escort.\\nAustralian media reported that the group were intending to continue their journey to Beirut, where they hoped to be issued passports.\\nThe Australian government has repeatedly said it would not repatriate people from Syria and said those who returned who had committed crimes would be \"met with the full force of the law\".\\nBut it has previously taken the position that it is obliged to issue passports to citizens who present themselves at an Australian embassy.\\nRoj is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities - mainly women and children - who have been held there since IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria in 2019.\\nAmong them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.\\nSpeaking to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the camp\\'s director, Hakmiyeh Ibrahim said: \"My message is not only to Australia but to all countries: take your citizens, take these children and women\".\\nShe added that children were growing up surrounded by \"dangerous ideas and ideologies\" in the camp.\\n\"We brought families of ISIS-affiliated women and children here in 2017 and now it\\'s 2026,\" she said. \"The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.\"\\nThe Australian government said in a statement: \"Our security agencies have been monitoring - and continue to monitor - the situation in Syria to ensure they are prepared for any Australians seeking to return to Australia\".\\n\"People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law.\\n\"The safety of Australians and the protection of Australia\\'s national interests remain the overriding priority.\"\\nIn 2022, another group of Australians, consisting of four women and 13 children, were released from the Roj detention camp and brought back to Sydney, prompting a backlash from some in Australia.\\nLast month the UK home secretary said she would \"robustly defend\" the decision to remove Shamima Begum\\'s citizenship, according to a government source.\\nThe European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called for an investigation, but the government source said the decision had already been upheld by UK courts.\\nMs Begum was 15 when she travelled from east London to the Middle East, to a territory held by the Islamic State group, where she married a fighter.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'The continued build-up of US military in the Gulf region now points less to signalling and more to preparation.\\nThe arrival of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group near Iranian waters is already a significant move.\\nAnother aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, was last seen near the Strait of Gibraltar and has been heading east to support potential operations. Other assets have also been moved to the region, reinforcing the impression that Washington is assembling layered military options.\\nSuch deployments can serve as leverage in diplomacy. But taken together, they may also suggest that indirect talks between Tehran and Washington have reached a deadlock - one that could be followed by military action if neither side shifts positions.\\nThis raises a fundamental question: why do Iranian leaders, at least publicly, remain defiant in the face of the world\\'s most powerful military and its strongest regional ally in the Middle East?\\nThe answer lies in Washington\\'s stated conditions for talks.\\nFrom Tehran\\'s perspective, these demands amount not to negotiation but to capitulation.\\nThey include ending uranium enrichment, reducing the range of ballistic missiles so they no longer threaten Israel, halting support for armed groups across the region, and, as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated, changing the Islamic Republic\\'s treatment of its own citizens.\\nFor the Iranian leadership, these are not secondary policies. They form the core of what it sees as its security architecture.\\nIn the absence of powerful international allies, Tehran has spent decades building what it calls the \"Axis of Resistance\".\\nIt is a network of allied armed groups designed to keep confrontation away from Iran\\'s borders and shift pressure closer to Israel.\\n\\nTehran\\'s ballistic missile programme has served as a substitute for an ageing air force and limited access to advanced military technology.\\nThe nuclear programme, while officially described as peaceful, is widely seen as carrying deterrent value.\\nEven without weaponisation, mastery of the enrichment cycle creates what strategists call \"threshold capability\". It involves infrastructure that would require only a political decision to move toward military use. That latent capacity itself functions as leverage.\\nStripping away these elements would, in Tehran\\'s view, dismantle the foundations of its deterrence.\\nFrom the perspective of Iran\\'s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, accepting such terms could appear more dangerous than risking a limited war with the United States under President Donald Trump. A military confrontation, however costly, may be seen as survivable. Total strategic rollback may not.\\nYet the risks embedded in this calculation are profound, and not only for Iran.\\nAny US campaign could target senior leadership in its opening phase. If Khamenei is killed, it would not only end a more-than three-decade rule but could destabilise succession at a moment of vulnerability.\\nStrikes on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other security institutions could also weaken the apparatus that recently reasserted control after one of the deadliest and violent crackdowns in the Islamic Republic\\'s history.\\nProtesters who filled the streets in recent weeks - and withdrew only under overwhelming force - remain deeply disaffected. A sudden blow to the state\\'s coercive machinery could shift the domestic balance in unpredictable ways.\\nTehran may assume that Washington\\'s objectives would be limited to degrading nuclear and missile capabilities. But wars rarely unfold according to initial assumptions. Miscalculation over targets, duration or political fallout could quickly expand the conflict.\\nEconomic pressures add another layer of risk. Iran\\'s economy, already strained by sanctions, inflation and declining purchasing power, would struggle to absorb further shocks. Disruption to oil exports or damage to infrastructure would compound public anger that has been suppressed rather than resolved.\\nIn this context, defiance serves multiple purposes. It signals resolve externally and projects strength internally. But it also narrows space for compromise.\\nWashington\\'s risks are no less real.\\nOn paper, the US military has the capacity to fulfil the commander-in-chief\\'s objectives if tensions escalate. But wars are not fought on paper. They are shaped by miscalculation, escalation and unintended consequences.\\nThe recent 12-day war with Israel exposed vulnerabilities in Iran\\'s command structure and military infrastructure. It also offered lessons in adaptation, how to absorb strikes, recalibrate and respond under pressure.\\nA broader confrontation could produce outcomes neither side intends. A weakened central authority in Tehran would not automatically translate into stability or alignment with Western interests. Power vacuums can generate new, fragmented or radicalised centres of influence, complicating the regional balance in ways that are undesirable for Washington and its allies.\\nAyatollah Khamenei now faces few favourable options. Accepting Washington\\'s conditions risks hollowing out the regime\\'s deterrent strategy. Rejecting them increases the likelihood of confrontation at a time of internal fragility.\\nBetween what he may see as the \"worst\" option; strategic surrender, and the \"best of the worst\", a limited but containable war, Tehran appears, at least publicly, to be leaning toward the latter.\\n'},\n",

While the exact death toll remains unclear, the level of brutality and the deployment of lethal weaponry evidenced in pictures, witness accounts and reports by human rights groups and the media show thousands have been killed across the country.\\nThe crackdown on protests - which began over the economy but rapidly escalated - employed a level of violence unprecedented in modern Iranian history.\\n\"This is the largest mass killing in contemporary Iranian history and one of the largest in the world,\" Payam Akhavan, an Iranian Canadian former UN prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, in The Hague, told BBC News Persian.\\nThe Iranian government has blamed the killings on \"rioters and terrorists\".\\nBut BBC News Persian analysis shows security forces used a number of different weapons on protesters, including:\\nmachine guns\\nsniper rifles\\nassault rifles\\nshotguns\\nhandguns\\npellet-firing paintball guns\\ntear gas\\nmachetes\\nknives\\nbatons\\nlarge wooden clubs\\ngreen laser sights and pointers (for blinding and targeting)\\nFootage from cities such as Tehran, Isfahan, Yazdanshahr, and Shahsavar, verified by BBC News Persian, shows both heavy - such as the DShK - and medium - such as the PK - machine guns mounted on military pickup trucks.\\nThe security forces reportedly used these for crowd control and to impose a state of siege.\\nThe Vahid Online Telegram channel shared two photographs of a black pickup truck with a machine gun mounted in the back in Tehran\\'s Sadeghiyeh Square on the night of 8 January.\\nBBC News Persian cross-referenced these with photos, published by Iran\\'s semi-official Fars News Agency, of a 2025 military parade, showing nearly identical Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) pickups equipped with the same weapon. Weapons expert Amael Kotlarski, of Janes defence-intelligence company, has identified it as the DShKM model, produced under licence in Iran.\\nA video of the 9 January protests in Yazdanshahr, published by the Iran International television network, clearly shows protesters coming under sustained machine-gun fire. The gun\\'s massive muzzle fire is visible at the 46-second mark.\\nA representative of Thames Valley Guns, a UK-based company specialising in the expert analysis of military firearms, also told BBC News Persian vehicles equipped with DShK machine guns could be seen in the videos of the protests.\\nIn one verified video, someone displays two spent cartridge casings from a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle and one large spent shell, explaining security forces had fired them at protesters in Tehran\\'s Behesht Square.\\nThames Valley Guns confirmed the large black projectile was a 20mm automatic cannon round designed to be used against military hardware. And rifling marks on its driving band confirm it had been fired.\\n\"Ammunition of this nature is intended to defeat structures, vehicles and hardened targets, including lightly armoured personnel carriers,\" the representative said.\\n\"They are not engineered for use against personnel, though the consequences of such a strike on a human would be catastrophic.\"\\nWitnesses have told BBC News Persian sniper rifles were widely used during the January protests and this is confirmed by the verified footage.\\nOne of the videos verified by BBC News Persian, of the 9 January protests in the north-eastern city of Mashhad, shows two figures in black tactical uniforms of the type worn by several branches of the security forces, including the IRGC, on a hotel rooftop. And one of them has a Dragunov sniper rifle (SVD) leaning against a wall next to him.\\nIn an interview with Iranian state television, a forensic expert confirmed snipers had killed protesters. On 8 January, a relative of Ebrahim Pourahmadian, from Saqqez, in the western province of Kurdistan, who was in Tehran, working as the caretaker of a building, told BBC News Persian a sniper had shot him in the head, right in front of his child.\\nAnd photographs obtained by BBC News News Persian of Pourahmadian\\'s body confirm a single precision gunshot wound, in the middle of his forehead.\\nThe Thames Valley Guns representative explained the profound psychological impact of a well positioned sniper. \"For untrained civilians, the effect is even more severe,\" the representative said. \"Most people have no understanding of how to respond to a distant, unseen threat — and the resulting fear certainly triggers mass panic.\"\\nThe Kalashnikov assault rifle is the standard-issue weapon for all military and law-enforcement branches in Iran. And BBC News Persian has analysed numerous videos showing members of both the police and the IRGC using using AK-47 Kalashnikovs and the Iranian-produced KL variants.\\nOne, from the northern city of Amol, on 9 January, shows a security officer aiming and firing a Kalashnikov directly at protesters. And after analysing exclusive images obtained by BBC News Persian of spent casings recovered from the streets, Kotlarski confirmed they were 7.62x39mm rounds - the specific calibre for Kalashnikov-type rifles.\\nBBC News Persian\\'s investigation confirms the extensive use of shotguns.\\nVerified footage from the western city of Lordegan, on 1 January, and Abadan, also in the west, on 7 January, shows police officers with shotguns deployed on streets during protests. And Kotlarski identified several models, including the Iranian-made Maher shotgun in both standard and short-barrelled configurations.\\nAs we saw during the crackdown on the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom protests, the widespread use of shotguns in January resulted in the killing of many protesters and left hundreds, if not thousands, more with permanent eye injuries.\\nBetween 9 and 10 January, about 1,000 patients needing emergency surgery for ruptured eyeballs caused by metal pellets arrived at a single eye hospital alone, its head, Dr Ghasem Fakhraei, told the semi-official Iranian Students\\' News Agency.\\nAnd BBC News Persian has obtained CT scans and medical records of several wounded protesters from Mashhad, one of which clearly shows a metal pellet embedded in the eye tissue.\\nIn two videos from Kermanshah, on 8 January, plainclothes security forces agents are seen wielding at least two types of pistols, which, analysts suggest, resemble the Beretta Model 50 or CZ 75.\\nNumerous protesters have told BBC News Persian they were attacked with knives and machetes. Photographs obtained by BBC News Persian of the bodies also reveal machete as well as bullet wounds\\nCCTV footage from Tehran clearly shows plainclothes agents attacking protesters seeking refuge in a block of flats with machetes.\\nAnother video from the capital, on 8 January, shows a plainclothes officer hitting a female protester in the head with a machete. Several other security personnel in military uniforms are also visible.\\nVideos and interviews carried out by BBC News Persianwith the survivors show people being beaten with batons. BBC News Persian verified that one protester, Saghar Seifollahi Fars, was killed in this way and another, Ali Taherkhani, who was first shot, died not because of bullet wounds but from being beaten afterwards by batons and gun butts.\\n'},\n",

But on the nights of 7 and 8 January, she said, it was impossible to remain uninvolved.\\n\"If you left your house, you saw it,\" she said. The BBC has changed her name to protect her and her husband\\'s identities.\\nOne evening, after eating in a restaurant, they stepped outside to find the city transformed: Crowds filled the streets and in some areas, security forces appeared to have lost control.\\n\"It felt like people had occupied Tehran,\" she said.\\nProtests erupted across Iran just before the new year, driven by anger over economic hardship and a collapsing currency, but quickly escalated into calls for an end to the Islamic Republic. Days later, security forces responded with deadly force.\\nThe true death toll is difficult to verify, due to an internet blackout in Iran and the lack of independent reporting. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it confirmed more than 6,000 protesters dead, while Norway-based Iran Human Rights said the final toll could exceed 25,000. Iranian authorities said at least 3,117 people were killed, but claimed most were members of security forces or bystanders, blaming the deaths on \"rioters.\"\\nUS President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced support for Iranian protesters. On Friday, US and Iranian officials held talks, though expectations remain low. Onboard Air Force One later in the day, Trump said the talks were \"very good\", and that Iran \"looks like it wants to make a deal very badly\".\\nMojdeh\\'s voice faltered as she described her homeland during the protests: people running, shouting, beaten - scenes that stayed with her long after they managed to leave Iran.\\nHer husband was shocked for another reason: Among friends and family in Iran, the idea of US military involvement was not considered an attack, he said. It was \"help\".\\nThe couple, living safely in the US, understand the desperation, but remain sceptical that such action could deliver what protesters ultimately want - not just regime change, but dignity, economic security and freedom.\\nFrom a distance, they worry about the cost of mistaking destruction for salvation.\\nWeeks after the deadly crackdowns on anti-government protests and the near-total internet blackout, Iranians inside and outside the country still wrestle with whether the US should intervene.\\nShirin, an Iranian-American living in California, said she still hopes for foreign intervention.\\n\"If the international community truly wants to stop the violence and prevent further global instability, action is required,\" said Shirin, 52, who asked that her surname not be published, fearing for family in Iran.\\n\"When the head of the snake is not cut off, the venom spreads — beyond borders, beyond regions, beyond generations.\"\\nBut some Iranians worry that intervention could hurt their loved ones still living under the regime.\\nRoozbeh Farahanipour, once imprisoned in Iran for his student activism and now a restaurant owner in Los Angeles, told the BBC he\\'s \"constantly worried\" about US intervention.\\n\"I don\\'t know how many have been killed, how many are injured, or who is missing. I don\\'t know how to reach mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, wives, husbands, or children to offer condolences and express solidarity,\" he said.\\nThere should be global help, he said, but he remembers the risks and history of US intervention. Ultimately, regime change should come from within, he said.\\n\"Today, the greatest power relies in unity, discipline, determination, and mass public mobilisation — building overwhelming crowds and actively calling on the remaining bases of the regime to defect and join the people\\'s movement. That internal collapse is far more decisive than any outside force,\" said Farahanipour.\\nAli, 43, was born in Iran and has lived in the US for 21 years. For much of his adult life, he supported reform within Iran\\'s political system and voted mostly for moderate US presidential candidates. Around 2014, he said, he gave up.\\n\"We\\'ve seen this before,\" Ali said — protests, promises, crackdowns — pointing back to 2009 and earlier uprisings in Iran. He asked that his last name not be shared.\\nEach time, he said, people were killed and little changed. In his view, the regime cannot be reformed — and without outside pressure, it cannot be defeated.\\nHe is not calling for a full-scale invasion, but for targeted strikes aimed at state infrastructure and key leaders rather than civilians. He argued that attacking a regime at the request of its people is different from attacking a country outright.\\nMany of those he knows in Iran now want some form of US intervention - not because they trust American motives, but because they see no other way.\\nHemad Nazari, an Iranian activist and photographer who left the country in 2015 and now lives in Denmark, echoes that belief.\\n\"How are we going to negotiate with this regime?\" said Nazari, 36.\\nForeign intervention could change the balance, he said. \"The best time [to intervene] was a month ago. The second-best time is now.\"\\nNazari, who is not affiliated with any organisation or political group, created a network to share firsthand accounts from Iran, particularly during protests and internet blackouts. During blackouts, people in Iran messaged him through alternative channels, like Starlink. Nazari then shares their stories on his own social media platforms, including on X where he has over 21,000 followers.\\nBecause Nazari\\'s network, started in 2019, has grown so large, he said he cannot return to Iran, fearing arrest. He\\'s received more than 500 direct messages just in the last few weeks, he said.\\nThe people he speaks to in Iran feel intervention is the only option, said Nazari. \"They say, \\'we went to the streets. We got killed. There is no other way.\\'\"\\nMany believe, he added, that even though civilians could die, without intervention, nothing will change.\\nEven as protests have quieted, repression continues in other forms.\\nIran Human Rights (IHRNGO), a nonpartisan human rights organisation, estimates that at least 40,000 people have been arrested since the protests began. The group said it has \"serious concern\" about the conditions of the missing or detained, including some denied access to lawyers and others held in unknown locations.\\nBoth IHRNGO and the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) claim they\\'ve heard reports that security forces are raiding medical centres and arresting staff who helped wounded protesters. But, HRANA notes that the head of Iran\\'s Medical Council Organization claimed \"no physician has been arrested for treating protesters\".\\nThe internet blackout has only partially eased, but many services remain unreliable or blocked.\\nFor Iranians at home and abroad, the debate over US involvement is no longer theoretical. It is shaped by grief, fear and exhaustion — and by a growing sense that time may be running out.\\nIt\\'s been difficult to watch the events of the last month from so far away, said Shirin.\\n\"It\\'s painful - as an Iranian, but also as a human being,\" she said. \"And it\\'s not even about our family - it\\'s 90 million people we\\'re worried about.\"\\n'},\n",

William will also be aware of the role of women and how they are treated in the country - while it has given women more freedom in recent years (in 2018 they were allowed to drive for the first time in decades), there are still enormous limitations compared with men.\\nAnd, importantly, William will have also been briefed on the reputation and history of MBS.\\nWill he bring up these topics in his discussions with the crown prince?\\nKensington Palace will not comment on plans for private conversations, but it is hard to imagine, taking into account the diplomatic sensitivities, that William will not touch on some difficult subjects during their private audience.\\nHe will be guided by the Foreign Office in London and the British Embassy in Saudi Arabia which will help him navigate any discussions with an eye on positive outcomes for the UK.\\nThe visit comes after a challenging seven days for the Royal Family, as the Epstein files continue to bring further embarrassment.\\nThe latest release has heaped further damage on the British royals, and sped up the move of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from his Royal Lodge mansion, where he lived for more than 20 years, to the Sandringham Estate.\\nIt is far from the ideal backdrop for a big international trip, but sources say Saudi Arabia is the number one request of the UK government, which wants to strengthen ties with MBS.\\nTo do so, it is using a member of the Royal Family who it feels can make an impact.\\n\"He is a diplomatic secret weapon – a formidable tool for the government to deploy,\" a source explained.\\nPrince William, who has talked about his own vision of a modern monarchy, is going to a country in transition.\\n\"Saudi Arabia has been opening up massively over the past decade,\" said Dr Neil Quilliam from the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, the international think tank.\\n\"This younger generation of policy makers are much more transactional than their forefathers, there is greater competition for Saudi investment in the UK,\" he explained.\\n\"The Saudis really like and appreciate being recognised and deploying Prince William sends a signal that says we really value you.\"\\nBut the images we\\'ll see this week of William with MBS will be hard to stomach for many.\\nA 2021 US intelligence report found that the Saudi crown prince approved the murder of exiled Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.\\nThe report, released by the Biden administration, said MBS approved a plan to either \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi.\\nSaudi Arabia rejected the report, calling it \"negative, false and unacceptable\" and MBS has denied any role in the murder.\\nAmid the moves to modernisation, what hasn\\'t changed is the Saudi authorities\\' attitude to its critics - both within the kingdom and abroad.\\nIn January, a judge in a UK court ruled that Saudi Arabia should pay Ghanem al-Masarir damages of more than £3m.\\nThe London based YouTuber and satirist had used his online voice to attack the Saudi regime. He told the court that he\\'d been followed, assaulted and had his phone bugged by agents acting for the kingdom, and that as a result he suffered psychological damage.\\nThe judges agreed with him.\\nDespite his experience, al-Masarir is not against Prince William\\'s visit, but urges the UK\\'s future king not to hold back.\\n\"I understand why he is going - to strengthen Saudi-UK relations. I have no problem with him going… Prince William has a privileged place and opportunity to speak to Mohammed bin Salman,\" al- Masarir said.\\n\"But to see them up there shaking hands - it is not real,\" he continues. \"Prince William will be standing next to a guy, who we know the CIA has said ordered the killing of Khoshaggi… it\\'s something you cannot comprehend\".\\nThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi and public opinion of Saudi\\'s human rights record does not appear to have limited the courting of MBS by world leaders - William joins an illustrious list of visitors.\\nA look back through the recent guests says a lot about the influence of Saudi Arabia – US President Donald Trump, France\\'s Emmanuel Macron, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, Ukraine\\'s Volodymyr Zelensky, and the UK\\'s own Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\\nEven Joe Biden, who once pledged to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights violations, then travelled to Jeddah, amid a storm of criticism, to meet the crown prince in 2022.\\nIt is the dilemma of being in the room even when some aspects of that country\\'s leadership don\\'t hold with your beliefs.\\nThis is what the British Royal Family has traditionally excelled at - the view that if you build relationships and strong ties, you then open the door for the government to more easily address the problematic and sensitive subjects. That is the soft power of monarchy.\\nThis is also a trip that brings together two royal families.\\nWilliam\\'s father, King Charles, has visited Saudi often, both publicly and privately, and maintains a warm relationship with the current generation of Saudi royals.\\n\"King Charles loves the desert and he spends a lot of time there in Saudi Arabia, painting and looking at the wildlife and likes the beauty,\" a former British senior diplomat to Saudi Arabia told me.\\n\"There is a special link between the two royal families… there is affection between the two Kingdoms and a lot of shared history.\"\\nThis will be another stage in what those who work with Prince William call his development as a global statesman.\\nHis job will be to smooth the way, to solidify relationships in a region of huge strategic importance to the UK.\\nAdditional reporting by Myranda Mowafi.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Two Gazan women who passed through the newly reopened Rafah crossing with Egypt on Monday have told the BBC that a local Palestinian militia linked to Israel carried out checks at an Israeli military checkpoint inside the Gaza Strip.\\nLamia Rabia, who was travelling with her children, said they were escorted by Israeli forces from the border to a nearby checkpoint where members of the Abu Shabab militia, also known as the Popular Forces, searched them and their belongings.\\n\"There was a woman from the Abu Shabab group who conducted the searches on the women,\" she told the BBC.\\n\"They didn\\'t speak with us, they only searched us and then we went to the Israelis, who questioned us.\\n\"The Israelis and the Abu Shabab group were together at the same point.\"\\nThe BBC asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) about these claims and whether they were coordinating with a local militia group in this way - they said they were unable to comment.\\nIsrael\\'s Shin Bet internal security agency has also been approached for comment, but the BBC has not received a response so far.\\nThe Abu Shabab militia is an anti-Hamas group that receives support and weapons from Israel, and operates in the Rafah area under Israeli military control.\\nGhassan al-Dheini, head of the militia, was quoted in Israeli media on Monday as saying his unit would play \"an important security role regarding entry and exit through the Rafah crossing\".\\nAsked how they could be sure the checks were carried out by Abu Shabab, one of the women the BBC spoke to said they had introduced themselves.\\nThe BBC has not been able to reach the militia leaders to confirm their involvement directly.\\nOne of the women, who the BBC is not naming in order to protect her identity, said that the group told her they would help her travel to Europe if she co-operated.\\nShe also said she was mistreated by the militia, alleging that she was beaten and strip-searched along with three other women, and that they had been handcuffed and verbally abused.\\nRabia said her experience of the process had been easy with no negative effects.\\nThe European Union, which has monitors at the crossing to check people who are leaving, is reportedly considering whether to escort new arrivals to the Israeli checkpoint, after reports of harsh treatment there.\\nBoth the women the BBC spoke to also said that EU officials working with Palestinians inside the Rafah crossing had confiscated a wide variety of their belongings.\\n\"They took perfumes, accessories, make-up, cigarettes, headphones - everything, they didn\\'t leave anything with us,\" one woman told the BBC.\\n\"The Europeans took from us anything that was liquid, like a cough syrup,\" said Rabia. \"They also took from us perfumes, and make-up, as well as phones and power banks. Any toy with a remote-control was taken.\"\\nRabia said there was also a limit on the amount of money each person could carry into Gaza, set at $600 (£438).\\nAnouar El Anouni, EU Spokesman for Foreign Affairs, said EU Border Assistance Mission to Rafah personnel were present at the crossing only to monitor the Palestinian-run operations there, and were not confiscating any items.\\n\"The list of items that are authorised to enter into Gaza is part of the overall agreement process between the Israelis, Egyptians, and the Palestinians,\" she said, adding any unauthorised items would be confiscated by Palestinian officials.\\nFifty patients were due to return to Gaza through Rafah on Monday after completing treatment in Egypt. They arrived at the Egyptian side of the crossing in the early hours of the morning, with their accompanying relatives.\\nBut only 12 people made it across, despite all passenger names being screened by both Egyptian and Israeli security in advance.\\nA Palestinian employee working on the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing said that the patients and their companions arrived from Egypt, and that Palestinian staff and European monitors completed security checks, passport checks and stamping procedures.\\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media, he said the travellers then waited for several hours inside the crossing compound, before Israeli authorities called forward only 12 people - nine women and three children - escorting them to an Israeli inspection point.\\nThe remaining passengers were ordered to return to Egypt, without explanation.\\nEight of them were the relatives of Awad Abu Talha. He had waited for his cousins all day and evening as they progressed slowly through the crossing. Some had made it through to the Palestinian side, before all were sent back to Egypt, because of a technical problem.\\nOn Tuesday afternoon, his family finally managed to cross into Gaza.\\nConfusion and obscurity has surrounded the reopening of the Rafah crossing.\\nThe Israeli government organisation responsible for civilian liaison in Gaza (Cogat) has not responded to repeated requests to confirm the number of people who crossed in and out of Rafah on Monday.\\nThe World Health Organization said that five patients and seven companions were transferred out of Gaza for medical care on Monday, adding that it was a drop in the ocean of the 18,500 Gazans needing medical evacuations.\\n\"It\\'s a start of a process,\" said its spokesperson, Christian Lindmeier. \"We\\'re hoping this is increasing and turning into a process where many more of those who need medical evacuations can actually leave.\"\\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza said the number of evacuations had risen slightly on Tuesday, with 16 patients and 40 companions leaving the territory.\\nIts spokesman, Raed al-Nims, accused Israel of delaying procedures, and called on the international community to put pressure on Israel to increase the flow of patients.\\nThe new travel mechanism through the Rafah crossing has also become a real test of Hamas control in Gaza, highlighting the difficulty of excluding the group from the territory\\'s affairs.\\nAnd the new procedures at Rafah - which bypass Hamas - are showing signs of weakening under pressure from the militant group to reassert control.\\nOn Monday, evacuees assembled in Gaza at a medical point 4km (2.5 miles) from Nasser Hospital, in Khan Younis. The hospital itself is under the authority of Gaza\\'s Hamas-controlled health ministry.\\nOn Tuesday, Palestinian officials and local journalists said members of the health ministry had unexpectedly appeared at the medical point, along with representatives from Hamas\\'s media office and interior ministry, and that they had begun intervening directly in preparations for the second day of evacuations.\\nThese developments have also exposed the limited role currently played by the new National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which has played no part in the evacuation process despite being designated as Gaza\\'s new temporary administrators under US President Donald Trump\\'s plan.\\nThe reopening of Rafah signals the start of a new and difficult phase of that plan, hinging on the disarmament of Hamas, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and the authority and control of a new administration.\\nThe disagreements, fractures and confusion around Rafah are a warning of the tougher challenges that lie ahead.\\nAdditional reporting by Orsi Szoboszlay\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Hamas is holding an election for a new interim leader, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the armed group\\'s affairs has told the BBC.\\nVoting is taking place across Gaza, the occupied West Bank and among Hamas\\'s members elsewhere.\\nThe outcome may signal which direction the movement intends to take - particularly as the US and other mediators discuss post-war governance of Gaza, reconstruction efforts and the future status of armed groups there.\\nThe elections come after most of Hamas\\'s senior leadership were killed in Israeli strikes following the group\\'s 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage.\\nPeople in Gaza have already cast their votes in secret, according to the source, but it is unclear whether the process has concluded elsewhere. When announced, the new leader will hold office for a year.\\nHamas governs the Gaza Strip and in recent years has had growing support in the West Bank, though its activities there are heavily constrained by the Israeli military and Palestinian Authority security forces.\\nA US-backed ceasefire in Gaza came into effect in October, and negotiations continue over the deal\\'s later phases.\\nUnder the proposed terms of the US plan, Hamas would have no role in the future governance of the territory. Governance would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, once it has undergone reforms.\\nYahya Sinwar, the overall head of Hamas, was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza in October 2024, and its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an Israeli attack in Iran in July that year. Hamas\\'s military chief Mohammed Deif was also killed that July, in an Israeli air strike on Gaza.\\nThe position of overall head of Hamas has remained vacant since the deaths of Haniyeh and Sinwar, with the movement being led by an interim committee headed by Qatar-based Mohammad Darwish after the latter was killed.\\nUnder the movement\\'s rules, the head of Hamas is chosen by an electoral college of around 86 members drawn from the General Shura Council, Hamas\\'s top decision-making body representing Gaza, the West Bank, Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and officials based abroad.\\nAccording to the official, the race is primarily between:\\nKhalil al-Hayya, who leads Hamas in Gaza and is widely seen as aligned with Sinwar and Haniyeh\\nKhaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas abroad and one of the movement\\'s veteran figures, who previously served as its overall leader for nearly two decades\\nMeshaal is currently thought to reside in Doha, Qatar.\\nOther internal discussions have included additional names, but no formal shortlist has been announced.\\nThe war that followed Hamas\\'s 7 October attack has had a deep impact on the movement\\'s internal politics. Israeli strikes have killed senior Hamas figures and significantly diminished the group\\'s military and political structures, weakening the influence of its Gaza-based leadership.\\nMore than 72,000 people have been killed in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says, though it does not distinguish between civilians and fighters.\\nFor years, Hamas has been shaped by a persistent internal rivalry between two broad currents.\\nOne, often described as aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, and represented by Meshaal and parts of the external leadership, is viewed by observers as more pragmatic and less ideologically rigid.\\nThe other was seen as closer to Iran, a vital Hamas ally that supplies financial backing and weaponry, and was represented most prominently by Sinwar and leaders inside Gaza.\\nIn 2017, when Haniyeh became head of the political bureau and Sinwar assumed leadership inside Gaza, decision-making shifted heavily towards the territory.\\nThe recent war, however, appears to have reopened space for figures from the movement\\'s so-called \"old guard\", traditionally linked to Meshaal.\\nUnder Hamas\\'s internal regulations, its political leadership is composed of 18 members: six representing Gaza, six representing the West Bank and prisoners, and six representing Hamas abroad.\\nFigures associated with the \"old guard\" appear to be regaining more prominence after years of Gaza-dominated decision making, according to officials familiar with the discussions.\\nWith Gaza devastated by years of conflict and its political landscape in flux, the selection of a new leader is seen as a critical step in determining how Hamas navigates mounting internal and external pressures in the year ahead.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Iran has been fortifying an underground complex near one of its nuclear facilities, according to analysis of new satellite images.\\nThis activity comes at a time of heightened tensions as talks between Iranian and US officials continue, with President Donald Trump threatening fresh military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal on its nuclear programme.\\nThe photos, first analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based think tank, show tunnel entrances being strengthened at Mount Kolang Gaz La - also known as Pickaxe Mountain.\\nExperts say this facility may be designed to protect Iran\\'s uranium enrichment activities or key equipment, but its exact purpose - and whether it is operational - remains unclear.\\nIran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.\\nHowever, Trump said Iran was as little as a month away from having a nuclear weapon in June 2025, when he ordered strikes on three underground nuclear sites where centrifuges were being used to produce highly enriched uranium during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year.\\nTrump said the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran\\'s enrichment capacity, but that Iranian officials \"were thinking about starting a new site\".\\nPickaxe Mountain was not one of the locations attacked in US and Israeli air strikes in June 2025, but the Natanz nuclear facility, located about 2km (1.24 miles) north, was hit.\\nA satellite image from 10 February shows what appears to be fresh concrete laid on top of one of the Pickaxe Mountain entrance areas.\\nA boom pump used to deliver concrete can be seen at the location, analysts from both ISIS and UK-based intelligence analysis firm Maiar agreed.\\nAt another tunnel entrance, rock and soil has been pushed back and flattened. There\\'s also a new concrete-reinforced structure nearby.\\nExperts at ISIS suggest these changes are intended to strengthen the tunnel entrances and give additional protection against a potential air strike.\\nISIS says the ongoing presence of heavy construction machinery and material indicates the facility is not likely to be ready for operations yet.\\n\"In the past, Iran has tied the construction to rebuilding an advanced centrifuge assembly plant, but the size of the facility, as well as the protection provided by the tall mountain, raised immediate concern whether additional sensitive activities are planned, such as uranium enrichment,\" they said.\\nSatellite images also show repair work and defensive strengthening has been taking place at the nearby Natanz nuclear site and at the Isfahan nuclear complex, 125km (77 miles) to the north, in recent weeks.\\nAt Isfahan, all entrances to its tunnel complex now appear to be sealed off with earth, satellite images reviewed by ISIS reveal.\\nBackfilling the tunnel entrances like this would \"help dampen\" any air strike, ISIS says, as well as help to defend against a land-based assault to seize or destroy any highly enriched uranium that may be housed inside.\\nAlso at Isfahan nuclear site, a new roof has been constructed. The building, attacked in an Israeli strike last year, is thought have been used in the manufacture of centrifuges.\\nAbove-ground work is also visible at Natanz nuclear facility at a location damaged in air strikes by both Israel and the US last June. Between early December and January a roof has been built over a damaged anti-drone cage at an enrichment plant.\\nISIS has assessed the roof was added to block the view of anyone trying to observe what Iran was doing beneath it.\\nProf Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University in the US, says Iran is \"operating under the assumption that the attacks are going to happen and they need to protect the facilities as much as they can\".\\n\"[The] Iranian nuclear programme hasn\\'t been destroyed,\" he added. \"Clearly once you have the knowledge and capacity and technology to reconstruct the programme, you can always rebuild everything.\"\\nRafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC a new nuclear deal between Iran and the US was possible and was urgently needed.\\n\"My sense, talking to all those involved, is that we have a window of opportunity, but windows of opportunity have a tendency to shut themselves quite abruptly and brusquely, so I think the we need to seize the moment,\" he said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference.\\nHe also said he believed Iran\\'s estimated 400kg of highly enriched uranium - which is a short, technical step away from weapons grade - remained in the underground tunnels and chambers where the US dropped bunker-busting bombs last June.\\nGraphics by Tom Shiel\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'When clocks struck nine across Tehran on Tuesday, the night skies filled with sound in celebration of the 47th year of the Iranian revolution.\\nWe listened from our hotel balcony as chants of \"God is greatest\" rose from rooftops and roared from windows. Fireworks flared in a kaleidoscope of brilliant colours.\\nBut this year, in this annual explosion of light and sound, there was a discordant note.\\nWe heard \"death to the dictator\" shouted too from somewhere in the darkness of the city, from the safety of spaces indoors.\\nIt was a dramatic echo of the extraordinary wave of protests, which swept some streets and squares of Tehran, and towns and cities across this country last month. They were met with unprecedented lethal force and a huge loss of life unseen in previous uprisings.\\nIt\\'s our first trip to Iran since the protests, as the authorities slowly lift their near total internet blackout, described as one of the longest digital shutdowns in history, and gradually allow a small number of international media to return.\\nThe mood in the capital is in stark contrast to our visit last June, at the end of the 12-day war with Israel, which also drew in America\\'s attacks on Iran\\'s nuclear sites.\\nThat deadly conflagration had left many residents, including those who fled Tehran for safer cities, shaken by the blistering attacks and cemented their attachment to their country.\\nNow, this sprawling metropolis set against the stunning, snowy Mount Damavand is decked out in flags and bunting to mark what\\'s known as the \"ten days of dawn\".\\nIn 1979, this period ushered in an historic revolution that ousted the shah, totally transformed Iran, and created a radical \"axis of resistance\" among its allies across the region which has long been condemned and confronted by its enemies.\\nThis year, the days are overshadowed by discontent and defiance over everything from the soaring prices of everyday goods hitting people\\'s pockets, to calls which sounded on streets last month for an end to clerical rule.\\nThese internal pressures, compounded by US President Donald Trump\\'s warning of more military strikes if diplomacy fails, now pose an unparalleled challenge to Iran\\'s ageing theocracy.\\nOn Wednesday, on the last day of these anniversary events, the streets of the capital and other major cities were flooded with the government\\'s most loyal foot soldiers - a political reply to the protests.\\nThere was a festival air on this public holiday as families marched and meandered in a warm winter\\'s sun.\\nChildren and adults waved Iranian flags and photographs of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, chanting their signature slogans of \"death to America\" and \"death to Israel\".\\n\"To me and to all Iranians, the revolution means a revival of life; new life was blown into our society and country, and I believe even to the Islamic world, and the whole world,\" exclaimed a beaming young woman who, like many women participating in this rally, was clothed in a long black veil.\\nWhen I asked her about the protests, she replied: \"There were people protesting who were dissatisfied with the economic situation, and their protest was legitimate.\" But, she added: \"It is clear that those who rioted, and brought about chaos, had intentions which originated from beyond our borders.\"\\nIran\\'s President Masoud Pezeshkian, speaking from a raised stage in Tehran\\'s iconic Azadi (Freedom) Square before a massive crowd seething with emotion, reflected that view too.\\nHe blamed \"malicious propaganda\" perpetuated by Iran\\'s enemies - usually code words for America and Israel - for inflaming the unrest he referred to as riots.\\nBut this senior official regarded as a reformist, who has tried to strike a conciliatory note since the start of the protests, also apologised for the government\\'s shortcomings. \"We are ready to listen to the voice of the people,\" he emphasised.\\nHe said they were making \"every possible effort\" to fix the problems - for him, that\\'s a reference to the currency collapse and cost of living crisis that sparked a shopkeepers\\' strike on 28 December which spiralled into something much bigger.\\nIn Iran\\'s clerical system, real authority lies higher up with the 86-year-old supreme leader. He and the head of the judiciary have vowed there will be no leniency for people branded as terrorists and troublemakers.\\nThe day before, on our first day in Tehran, we stopped by Enghelab (Revolution) Square on a drizzly grey day to try to get a sense of the mood in this city.\\nSoaring murals, brightly painted, of smiling crowds dominate building facades around this busy roundabout.\\nBut a dark pall seemed to hang over this space.\\nSome Iranians, hurrying about their day, demurred from speaking. One woman told us it was too \"dangerous\" to talk to a journalist at this time.\\nBut many more, when asked a very open question, \"what\\'s the main worry on your mind?\", paused only briefly before pouring out their anger and pain.\\nEmotion was still raw, palpable, after all that\\'s happened here.\\nRaha immediately burst into tears. \"It has been a month now since I haven\\'t eaten or slept properly. Look at me, I am young, only 32, why should I be so ravished and depressed?\" she cried.\\n\"I swear to God they keep saying that it was rioters. But people were not armed. What was their sin?\" she demanded.\\nBespectacled, 20-year old Dori, who like some women no longer wears the mandatory headscarf, reflected how \"last month was terrible\".\\n\"After the internet connections were restored, we saw a lot of horrible videos and photos of people under attack; they made us cry,\" she explained.\\nFor 62-year-old Akhtar in a rose-pink headscarf, who spoke with fierce emphasis, there were two worries. \"So many young people were killed,\" she lamented first. Then she expressed the agony we hear from so many Iranians over the growing hardship in their day-to-day lives.\\n\"The price of cooking oil has quadrupled; meat and chicken are the same. And unemployment is so high,\" she exclaimed.\\nMany of the people we spoke to, when asked about their message to the leaders now, replied like 20-year-old Amir. \"I think they should hear our voices.\"\\nHis 19-year-old friend Amir, standing beside him, was visibly upset. \"I just want our basic needs and freedoms.\"\\nBut even relieving the economic distress, magnified by water and electricity shortages, is entangled in decades of crippling international sanctions, suspicion over Iran\\'s nuclear ambitions, as well as chronic corruption and mismanagement.\\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran now stands at a crossroads, confronting its most consequential tests since its own uprising almost half a century ago.\\nThe BBC\\'s chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet is reporting from Tehran on condition that none of her material is used on the BBC\\'s Persian Service. These restrictions apply to all international media organisations operating in Iran.\\n'},\n",

Up to now, settlers could only buy homes from registered companies on land controlled by Israel\\'s government.\\nIsraeli ministers presented the change as \"a step that will increase transparency and facilitate land redemption\". Israel\\'s foreign ministry later said it corrected a \"racist distortion\" that \"discriminated against Jews, Americans, Europeans, and anyone who is not Arab regarding real estate purchases in Judea and Samaria\".\\nThe cabinet also decided to repeal a legal requirement for a transaction permit to complete any purchase of real estate, thereby reducing oversight meant to prevent fraud.\\nPalestinians said they feared the changes would lead to more pressure on individuals to sell, as well as acts of forgery and deceit.\\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA), governing parts of the West Bank - called the measures \"dangerous\" and an \"open Israeli attempt to legalise settlement expansion, land confiscation and the demolition of Palestinian properties, even in areas under Palestinian sovereignty\".\\nHe called for the US and UN Security Council to intervene immediately.\\nThe Israeli NGO Peace Now said the cabinet\\'s decision risked toppling the PA and involved cancelling agreements and imposing de facto annexation. It accused the Israeli government of \"breaking every possible barrier on the path to massive land theft in the West Bank\".\\nThe UK said it \"strongly condemned\" the move and called on Israel to reverse the decision, saying \"any unilateral attempt to alter the geographic or demographic make-up of Palestine is wholly unacceptable and would be inconsistent with international law\".\\nThe foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar described the announcement as \"accelerating attempts at its illegal annexation and the displacement of the Palestinian people\".\\nTheir statement \"warned against the continued expansionist Israeli policies and illegal measures pursued by the Israeli government in the occupied West Bank, which fuel violence and conflict in the region\".\\nWith rights to the land at the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, land sales to settlers are a murky business often involving middlemen. They are considered as treason by the PA and are therefore technically punishable by death, although convicted individuals are typically given jail terms.\\nOther controversial steps announced by Smotrich, who has ministerial responsibility for settlement policies, and the Defence Minister, Israel Katz, include transferring building licensing at an important religious site and sensitive areas nearby in the volatile city of Hebron solely to Israeli authorities.\\nThe Cave of the Patriarchs - also known as the Ibrahimi Mosque - is revered by Jews, Muslims and Christians as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\\'s burial place. It is the second holiest site in Judaism and the fourth in Islam.\\nIsraeli bodies would also be given oversight and enforcement powers for environmental and archaeological matters in PA-administered areas.\\nAs well, a committee would be revived to allow the State of Israel to make \"proactive\" land purchases in the West Bank billed as \"a step designed to secure land reserves for settlement for generations to come\".\\nIn the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords, a breakthrough peace agreement, the newly created PA was given full control over Palestinian urban areas - about 20% of the territory - known as Area A.\\nIn Area B, a similar percentage, the PA had only administrative control, while Israel kept its hold on security.\\nIsrael retained full security and administrative control of 60% of the West Bank, where settlements are located, known as Area C.\\nMore than 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank and Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War. Those lands are wanted by Palestinians for their hoped-for independent state along with the Gaza Strip.\\nThe Trump administration has ruled out Israeli annexation of the West Bank but has not sought to check Israel\\'s accelerated settlement construction.\\nResponding to the latest move, a White House official reiterated the US\\' opposition to annexation, saying: \"A stable West Bank keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration\\'s goal to achieve peace in the region\".\\nSmotrich, a settler who heads a pro-settler party, has vowed to double the settler population in the West Bank.\\nIn December, Israel\\'s cabinet approved a proposal for 19 new settlements. Israel is also preparing to start construction of a contentious settlement project near Jerusalem, known as E1, which would effectively sever the northern and southern West Bank.\\nAccording to the UN, a record number of more than 37,000 Palestinians were displaced in 2025 alone - a year that it says also saw record-high levels of Israeli settler violence.\\nNetanyahu\\'s governing coalition includes many pro-settler members who want Israel to annex the West Bank, to which they claim religious and historic ties.\\nThe prime minister, who faces an election later this year, has declared he would never countenance the creation of a Palestinian state, which he said would be a security threat for his country.\\nIn 2024, the International Court of Justice - the UN\\'s highest court - issued a non-binding advisory opinion that Israel\\'s occupation of Palestinian territories was illegal and should end.\\n'},\n",

The United Nations says 90% of Syrians live below the poverty line.\\nIn early January, Kabawat rushed to the northern city of Aleppo to visit shelters harbouring thousands of people after fighting flared between government forces and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who have long dominated north-eastern Syria.\\nLast summer, she tried to bring aid into a southern city populated mostly by Druze after it was torn by deadly violence between Druze, Bedouin and Syrian government forces.\\nAnd she reached out to the family of an Alawite woman, from the same minority Shia sect as the Assad family, who accused armed men in military fatigues of rape.\\nThere are some complaints Kabawat could do more to help mend the fractures between Syria\\'s different communities.\\nAsked if the government made mistakes in its response to the sectarian violence, she replies: \"Mistakes happen in transition, in post-conflict; no-one is happy about it, including the president.\"\\nBut she stresses an inquiry was set up, and now \"many of those who committed those crimes are in prison\".\\nUnderstanding how to build trust, and peace, has defined much of her working life. Educated at universities in Syria, Lebanon, Canada and the United States, Kabawat is a lawyer and negotiator who played a leading role in the exiled Syrian opposition during the civil war.\\nIn her own arsenal, she sees her sharpest tool as dialogue.\\n\"It\\'s taking time for people to say \\'we trust you\\' after 50 years of dictatorship,\" she explains, emphasising that trust is needed \"people to people\" as well as between government and the population.\\nWe travel with her to the provincial capital of Idlib in the north-west, the former rebel stronghold of Sharaa\\'s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham forces.\\nShe worked here during the civil war, with Tastakel, a women-led organisation she founded. Its name translates roughly from Arabic as \"becoming independent\" - which also sums up her philosophy on building this new Syria.\\nIn a packed, brightly-lit hall, young and old women, and some men, from across Syria, are gathered to celebrate the end of the old order, and to strategise about strengthening the role of women at all levels of decision-making.\\nFor Kabawat, it is about taking responsibility.\\nIn recent indirect elections for the new transitional parliament, or People\\'s Assembly, not a single woman was elected from Idlib. Overall, only 4% of seats went to female candidates.\\n\"You should have been united and thought in a politically intelligent way to ensure we got one or two women elected,\" she scolds the women.\\nYou could feel the energy coursing through the room of well-spoken women, some wearing tightly wrapped headscarves, others in head-to-toe veils, and some -including Kabawat - bare-headed.\\nThis has always been the female face of Syria, a society often described as a mosaic of many traditions. Initial concerns that stricter Islamist rules would be imposed by Sharaa and his supporters, who adhere to a strict interpretation of Sunni Islam, have not materialised in the main, but worries still linger for some.\\nSharaa himself, a former al-Qaeda commander-turned-Islamist rebel leader, has shucked his military fatigues for a tailored Western-style suit and now positions himself as a pragmatist.\\nKabawat says that on that first day, when he announced his government in March last year, the president assured her more women would be appointed. \"He said: \\'It\\'s coming, we are in transition,\\'\" she adds.\\nAny suggestion she is a token woman in his ranks meets a firm rebuke.\\n\"I am not here for window dressing,\" she declares. \"I don\\'t feel that I am a Christian or a woman when I do my job. I feel like I am a citizen of Syria... The minute I start feeling like I\\'m a minority or I\\'m a woman, I will lose my legitimacy.\"\\nAt the conference in Idlib, there\\'s a sudden sign of a changing society. Kabawat is ambushed by an enthusiastic crowd of young women talking excitedly over each other - former students from her Tastakel classes.\\n\"We\\'re implementing the mission she taught us and we are trying to acquire more expertise so we are ready,\" says one of them, Siwar.\\nKabawat exclaims in approval as another, Ghufran, wags her finger for emphasis: \"We either occupy a space where we hold all the decision-making power, or we don\\'t want to be in that space at all.\"\\nEven in deeply conservative Idlib, women of an earlier generation played leadership roles in civil society during the war.\\nSoftly-spoken and exuding confidence, Ahlam al-Rasheed is now the director of social affairs in the provincial government.\\nNearly a decade ago, in 2017, she earned a place on the BBC\\'s 100 Women list with her work promoting women\\'s rights.\\nDuring the civil war, women \"led across several sectors, including in politics, relief, education and health\", she says. Many were - and still are - the main breadwinners in their families.\\nWe travel to a bleak tented camp on barren land on the edge of the city, where we see the reality of what Rasheed says is the biggest challenge facing Syrian women now.\\nThis camp, and countless others dotting the country, house millions of Syrians whose homes still lie in utter ruin.\\nKabawat briefly greets the robed and suited men standing in line to receive her. Then she makes a beeline for a gaggle of giggling children and expectant women, most in flowing black cloaks. The jaunty wool cap pulled over her honey-brown hair may be her nod to both the cold winter weather and more conservative ways.\\nInside a tented mosque, she sits on the floor listening to a litany of woes from women, many of them widows, living in grinding poverty and pain, without assistance.\\nAgain, Kabawat throws it back to them, asking who would like to be taught to make handicrafts to be sold internationally. A sea of hands rise.\\nThen, she is on her way, leading a \"choo-choo train\" formed by a line of delighted children, sprinkling humour, happiness and even a little hope, but not the real aid they so desperately need.\\nLater I ask her what she said to the man who lamented that he had worked so hard in the opposition but was still living in a tent.\\n\"Of course, they\\'re right,\" she reflects. \"I feel their pain.\" She highlights the urgent need for \"a united effort from the international community\".\\nI point out that donors say the government also has to move more quickly to establish a new legal system, as well as transparency.\\n\"Of course, they\\'re not right,\" she shoots back. \"We inherited a country which was completely destroyed and we\\'re working on laws to renew and adapt a new country - so it\\'s taking time.\"\\nHer tone is even more emphatic when I ask about reports that Sharaa\\'s inner circle is now creating a shadow government by taking away ministers\\' power to appoint their own deputies.\\n\"I won\\'t be here the minute I see that I can\\'t appoint my own deputy and don\\'t have the freedom to make my own strategy,\" she declares. \"Nobody controls me.\"\\nSharaa \"cannot rely on one side\", she adds. \"If he\\'s not going to be inclusive and bring many people together in the government… we can\\'t survive.\"\\nPost-Assad Syria has received hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from many countries.\\nAn American push - with President Donald Trump\\'s personal backing - has helped lift crippling sanctions.\\nBut the World Bank estimates that Syria will need at least $200bn (£145bn), just to rebuild its shattered landscape. And some donors are hesitating because of volatility in the country and wider region, exacerbated by Israel\\'s repeated attacks on its neighbour.\\nIsrael says it is acting against perceived threats posed by Syria\\'s armed groups.\\nAs we sit in Kabawat\\'s graceful living room, among framed family photographs and sprays of Syria\\'s new flag, her can-do composure breaks for a moment.\\n\"I see the suffering of the people... and feel responsible for their pain,\" she admits, wiping a tear. She says when she feels she does not have the resources to help people, that is the one time she asks herself \"why did I do this?\"\\nThen there\\'s a rustle outside the door. Another delegation is waiting to see her.\\n\"Khalas [enough], enough of tears,\" she vows. \"It\\'s another day and it\\'s back to work.\"\\nViewers in the UK can also watch the interview on Global Eye at 19:00 on Monday 2 February on BBC Two or on iPlayer\\nThis is part of the Global Women series from the BBC World Service, sharing untold and important stories from around the globe\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Israel has only twice used the death penalty against a convicted prisoner. The last time was more than sixty years ago, to hang the notorious Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann.\\nBut in the wake of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, Israel\\'s deadliest ever day, there is a political push to pass a highly controversial new capital punishment law, targeting Palestinians convicted by Israeli courts of fatal terrorist attacks.\\n\"It\\'s another brick in the wall of our defence,\" the far-right chair of the parliamentary national security committee, Zvika Fogel tells me. \"To bring in the death penalty is the most moral, the most Jewish and the most decent thing.\"\\nBut human rights groups see the bill as \"one of the most extreme legislative proposals\" in the history of Israel. They argue it is unethical, and because it is designed to apply only to Palestinians, they say it will bring about \"racialized capital punishment.\"\\nThere have been heated hearings in Israel\\'s parliament involving rabbis, doctors, lawyers and security officials. Families whose loved ones were killed in the brutal assault on southern Israel more than two years ago, and in the fighting in the devastating war in Gaza that followed, have turned out to speak against and in favour of the legislation.\\n\"In my view, only 10 or 20 per cent of the law is intended for justice, and the remaining percentage is deterrence and prevention,\" says bereaved mother, Dr Valentina Gusak, who backs the bill.\\nAddressing the national security committee, she displayed a photo of her 21-year-old daughter, Margarita who hoped to study medicine like both of her parents. She was killed with her boyfriend, Simon Vigdergaus as they fled the Nova music festival in 2023.\\n\"It\\'s preventive treatment – that\\'s what it\\'s called in medicine,\" says Dr Gusak about reintroducing capital punishment who believes it could have saved her daughter\\'s life. \"It\\'s a vaccine against the next murder, and we must ensure the future of our children.\"\\nThe death penalty does exist for certain crimes in Israel, but on the rare occasions when military courts previously handed down death sentences to convicted terrorists or enemy fighters, all were mitigated to life sentences following appeals.\\nThe Eichmann case was exceptional. The SS Lieutenant Colonel was an architect of the Holocaust. In 1960, he was snatched from Argentina by Israeli secret service agents before being put on a lengthy public trial before a special court in Jerusalem.\\nPrior to that, a military captain, Meir Tobianski, was executed for treason following a makeshift court martial in June 1948, shortly after the Israeli state was established. He was posthumously exonerated.\\nOpponents of capital punishment have rejected it on religious, ethical and legal grounds arguing it goes against Jewish law, violates the right to life and brings a risk of executing innocent people. But Israeli human rights groups also argue that the proposed new law will deepen discrimination by targeting only Palestinians convicted of terrorism and not Jewish Israelis.\\n\"The fact that we\\'re even re-discussing bringing this back into the legal system in Israel is itself a low point,\" says Tal Steiner, executive director of the Israeli NGO, HaMoked.\\n\"Beyond that our objection is that the law is racially designed, meant to apply only to Palestinians, never to Jews, only to people who kill Israeli citizens, never for example to Israeli citizens who kill Palestinians. The motivation is clear.\"\\nThe stated purpose of the draft legislation is to protect Israel, \"its citizens and its residents\", while \"increasing deterrence against the enemy\" and reducing the incentive \"to carry out kidnappings or take hostages in order to negotiate the release of terrorists\" as well as \"providing retribution\" for criminal acts.\\nMandatory death sentences would apply in Israeli military courts which exclusively try Palestinians from the occupied West Bank. After a compulsory appeal against the verdict, those convicted of deadly terrorist attacks would be hanged within 90 days.\\nThe bill would also allow the death penalty to be used within the same swift time frame in regular Israeli courts, but it would not be mandatory.\\nThere have been past proposals to introduce capital punishment for what are seen as terrorist actions, but the security establishment was previously among the main opponents of such a move, asserting that it increased tensions and was not an effective deterrent.\\nAlready, a high number of Palestinians who carry out deadly attacks on Israelis are shot dead in the process by the security forces or armed civilians.\\nWhen I meet Zvika Fogel from the far-right Jewish Power party which has put forward the new death penalty bill, he insists that the current heads of Israel\\'s security services are behind its efforts. He dismisses the idea that the law is unfair.\\n\"Let\\'s be accurate, my bill talks about terrorists and about an act of terrorism, there\\'s no discrimination here. The definition is very clear,\" he says. \"It\\'s true that I don\\'t think there\\'s such a thing as a Jewish terrorist or a Jewish act of terrorism. It\\'s a legal definition. I didn\\'t go any other way.\"\\nJewish Power put forward the new death penalty bill early in 2023. Following the 7 October attacks, the legislation was put on hold because security officials advised it could jeopardise efforts to bring back the 251 hostages – living and dead – who had been seized and were being held in Gaza by Palestinian armed groups.\\nLast year, the head of Jewish Power, the national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir was one of the few ministers to vote against the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal which saw the last remaining hostages returned in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees – about 250 of whom were serving life or lengthy sentences, many for killing Israelis. He said he was opposed to all hostage agreements.\\nJewish Power then threatened to leave the government if the death penalty legislation was not put to a vote. Last November, when it passed the first of three readings needed to become law by 39-16, in the 120-seat parliament or Knesset, Ben Gvir gave out sweets.\\nHis party insists capital punishment will reduce the incentive for future hostage taking and prevent contentious prisoner swaps. Its members of parliament have taken to wearing a golden noose-shaped lapel pin.\\n\"There won\\'t be any [more] prisoners released,\" says Zvika Fogel. \"For a prisoner who committed murder, there\\'ll be a death penalty so there won\\'t be a prisoner to make a deal on. It will prevent hostages being taken to be used as bargaining chips.\"\\nIn parliament, Limor Son Har-Melech, another member of Jewish Power who sponsors the bill has related her personal story. In 2003, she and her husband - who lived in a West Bank settlement - were attacked by Palestinian gunmen while in their car. Her husband was killed and she was injured, leading her to give birth by an emergency caesarean section.\\nSon Har-Melech explains that one of her husband\\'s killers went on to be released in a previous exchange deal to bring home an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza. She says he went on to command a deadly attack on another Israeli and take part in the 7 October attacks, before he was killed during the Gaza war.\\nSome 1,200 people were killed in the shocking assault on southern Israel just over two years ago. It triggered the deadliest ever war in Gaza, where more than 71,600 Palestinians have been killed according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.\\nMany see that the public mood in Israel has shifted in favour of more draconian punishments. But Arab-Israeli parliamentarian, Aida Touma-Suleiman, who represents the opposition Hadash party, says legislators should be careful how they respond.\\n\"He is feeding into the revenge and the anger that is existing among society,\" she says of Ben Gvir. \"But you cannot run legislation and courts by instincts of revenge.\"\\nTouma-Suleiman opposes the death penalty on principle and argues the bill also goes against international law and past treaties signed by Israel. If the legislation passes two more parliamentary votes and becomes law, she believes Supreme Court judges will strike it down.\\nHowever, she points out that this will prove a political point for Jewish Power in an election year. As part of the government, it has been taking steps to try to reduce the power of the courts.\\n\"It\\'s a win-win situation for Ben Gvir and his party to promote such a law. Because if this law actually passes, it\\'s for their constituency,\" Touma-Suleiman tells me. \"If he managed to pass it then I\\'m sure the Supreme Court will ask the Knesset to cancel the law, and he can start to say with the rest of the right-wing: \\'You see they want to run the country when we are the ones who are elected!\\'\"\\nIn social media videos shot in Israeli jails, Ben Gvir has posed with bound and blindfolded prisoners who are said to be members of the Hamas Nukhba force which carried out the 7 October attacks. He boasts that they receive the \"minimum of minimum conditions.\"\\nAccording to a recent article by the Israeli news site, Walla, a record high number of 110 Palestinian security detainees have died under the minister\\'s policies in the past two and a half years.\\nThe UN Committee against Torture said late last year that it was deeply concerned about reports indicating \"a de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture and ill treatment\" of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. It said such allegations had \"gravely intensified\" after the 2023 attacks. Israel has denied the claims.\\nWhile the final text of the death penalty law is being drawn up, another parliamentary committee is working on a separate bill to set up a dedicated military tribunal for the Nukhba prisoners.\\nThey are expected to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity much as Eichmann did six decades ago.

       "  'Article': 'With hundreds of millions of views, YouTuber Ghanem al-Masarir was flying high.\\nFrom his flat in Wembley, the loud-mouthed and sometimes offensive comedian was making waves as a critic of the Saudi Arabian royal family. But as well as fans, he\\'d made some powerful enemies.\\nThe first thing al-Masarir noticed was that his phones were behaving weirdly. They had become very slow, with the batteries running out quickly.\\nThen he noticed seeing the same faces appear in different parts of London. People who seemed to be Saudi regime supporters began stopping him in the street, harassing and filming him. But how did they know where he was all the time?\\nAl-Masarir feared his phone was being used to spy on him. Cyber experts would later confirm he\\'d become the latest victim to be spied on with the infamous Pegasus hacking tool.\\n\"It was something that I couldn\\'t comprehend. They can see your location. They can turn on the camera. They can turn on the microphone, listen to you,\" al-Masarir tells the BBC. \"They got your data, all pictures, everything. You feel you\\'ve been violated.\"\\nOn Monday, after six years of legal battles, the High Court in London ruled Saudi Arabia was responsible, and ordered the kingdom to pay al-Masarir more than £3m ($4.1m) in compensation.\\nAl-Masarir\\'s iPhones had been hacked in 2018 after he clicked on links in three text messages seemingly sent from news outlets as special membership offers.\\nIt led to him being stalked, harassed and in August of that year, beaten up in central London.\\nThe court heard two strangers had approached al-Masarir and shouted at him, demanding to know who he was to talk about the Saudi royal family, before punching him in the face and then continuing to attack him.\\nPassers-by intervened and the two men retreated, calling the YouTuber a \"slave of Qatar\" and saying they were going to \"teach him a lesson\".\\nThe High Court judge described the physical attack as premeditated and noted that one of the assailants was wearing an earpiece.\\n\"There is a compelling basis\" that the assault and the hack \"was directed or authorised by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or agents acting on its behalf,\" Mr Justice Saini said in his written judgement.\\n\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had a clear interest in and motivation to shut down the claimant\\'s public criticism of the Saudi government,\" the judge ruled.\\nAfter the assault, the harassment continued. In 2019, a child approached al-Masarir at a Kensington café and sang a song praising King Salman, the Saudi monarch.\\nThis incident was filmed and posted on social media, began trending with its own hashtag, and was even broadcast on state-owned television in Saudi Arabia.\\nOn the same day, a man walked up to al-Masarir as he was leaving a west London restaurant and told him, \"Your days are numbered\", before walking off.\\nAl-Masarir was born in Saudi Arabia but has lived in Britain for more than 20 years, originally coming to study in Portsmouth.\\nHe is now a British citizen and lives in Wembley, but no longer ventures far from home - going into central London is still frightening for him after he was attacked.\\nThe 45-year-old rose to fame in the Arabic-speaking world for his satirical YouTube videos criticising Saudi rulers, in particular the crown prince and de facto ruler Mohamed bin Salman.\\nAl-Masarir\\'s humorous takes - and sometimes personal and offensive attacks on the Saudi government - often went viral, generating more than 345 million views.\\nIn his most watched clip - which has 16 million views - he criticised the authorities for being angry about a viral video of girls dancing in Saudi Arabia. Mysteriously, the sound has been removed on YouTube and al-Masarir has no idea how or when the video was edited.\\nSince al-Masarir was hacked and attacked he has lost his confidence and become depressed and fearful. The once funny and outspoken personality agreed to talk to the BBC - but was reserved and didn\\'t want to fully show his face.\\nHe hasn\\'t posted a video for three years and says in spite of his legal victory, the Saudi government has succeeded in silencing him.\\n\"No amount of money can repay the harm this has done to me,\" he says. \"The hack has really changed me. I am not the same Ghanem I used to be.\"\\n\\nIt was spyware experts from the University of Toronto\\'s Citizen Lab who confirmed al-Masarir had been hacked with Pegasus spyware. They sent an analyst to London and deemed it highly likely the hack had been orchestrated by Saudi Arabia.\\nPegasus is a powerful and controversial hacking tool made by Israeli company NSO Group. NSO Group insists it only sells its spyware to governments to help track terrorists and criminals.\\nBut Citizen Lab has discovered it on phones belonging to politicians, journalists and dissidents - including al-Masarir.\\nWhen al-Masarir first tried to bring a claim against Saudi Arabia, the kingdom argued it was protected from legal action under the State Immunity Act 1978.\\nBut in 2022 the court ruled Saudi Arabia did not have immunity. Since, then the country has not been represented in any further proceedings.\\n\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has failed to serve a defence or to respond to this application and has breached multiple further orders. It appears unlikely to participate in the claim,\" the High Court judge concluded.\\nThe total damages awarded are £3,025,662.83 but it\\'s not clear if Saudi Arabia will pay.\\nThe BBC contacted the Saudi embassy in London but has not had a reply.\\nAl-Masarir says he is determined to enforce the judgement and is willing to use international courts if necessary. But no amount of money will make up for how the hack has turned his life upside down, he says.\\n\"I feel depressed that they got away with something like this in London - in Great Britain.\"\\n'},\n",

After the Islamic State (IS) group seized around a third of Syria and Iraq in 2014, the US and the Kurds worked hand in glove to drive them out.\\nNot anymore.\\n\"History will hold them accountable,\" says the commander, who has a handle-bar moustache and wears a green fringed scarf around his neck. \"Morally it\\'s not right. But we will keep fighting until our last breath. We are not cry-babies.\"\\nTheir current fight is with the central government in Damascus which wants to extend its control across all of Syria, including the Kurdish autonomous region in the north-east.\\nIn the past two weeks government troops have pushed the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) out of resource-rich areas they have controlled for a decade – since defeating IS.\\nAs conflict has flared, the White House has strongly backed Syria\\'s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former Jihadi. That\\'s a slap in the face for the Kurds. The SDF lost 11,000 fighters battling the jihadis of IS.\\nCommander Azad compares the president to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the late founder of IS. \"They are the same thing. After Jolani took over, Syria will always be a war zone,\" he says, referring to the president by his fighting name, Abu Mohammed Al Jolani.\\nHaving fought US troops in Iraq, Al Sharaa set up an al-Qaeda offshoot in Syria, which was in fact fiercely opposed to IS, though the groups had similar roots. He later broke with al-Qaeda, then in December 2024 swept to power in Damascus, ousting Bashar al Assad.\\nIn the eyes of the Kurds, Al Sharaa is still a Jihadi, but now in a suit.\\nCommander Azad stiffly climbs the stairs to an open rooftop with a commanding view of flat countryside.\\nBelow us sheep graze in the fields and clothing flaps on a washing line in a back garden.

I hope there will be no war, but if it comes, \\'Let it be welcome,\\'\" he says, quoting Che Guevara, Cuba\\'s revolutionary hero.\\nA fragile ceasefire between the two sides was due expire on 7 February. A deal has just been announced to extend the truce and begin the integration of Kurdish forces into the Syrian army. A previous deal on integration, signed last March, failed.\\n\"We don\\'t want war, but if we are forced down that path we will fight back,\" says Siyamend Ali, of the People\\'s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia that is the backbone of the SDF.\\n\"Every neighbourhood will turn into a hell for them,\" he added.\\nAli has already seen too many losses in the fight against IS. His fallen friends number in the hundreds.\\n\"There were friends I studied with in school and university, and friends I played with. They were from my family and from neighbouring families,\" says Ali, in a low and weary voice. \"They rose to martyrdom. Now I walk in their footsteps.\"\\nWe met at another frontline position - where mounds of dark soil formed fresh defences. If all-out war comes, it will be a losing battle for the Kurds. But there are implications far beyond this corner of Syria.\\nSince the defeat of IS in Syria in 2019, this area has been a holding ground for the remnants of the group\\'s so-called \"caliphate\". Kurdish-run prisons hold about 8,000 suspected IS fighters, and around 34,000 of their wives and families are detained in camps. Will the gates remain locked if this region becomes a battleground?\\nThe Syrian government has taken control of one camp, al-Hol, in eastern Hassakeh.\\nWhen we visited last October - with an armed escort - we got a hostile reception from veiled women, clad head to toe in black. One ran a finger across her neck, as if slitting a throat.\\nThe other main camp, called Roj remains in Kurdish hands. It\\'s home to more than 2,000 foreign women and children, who have been convicted of nothing.\\nRows of blue and white tents offer little protection from biting winter cold. Children play on a carpet of mud, ringed by fences, walls and watch towers. Roj is a prison in all but name.\\nWe returned there this week to find the camp manager Hekmiya Ibrahim increasingly worried. She is slight but determined, a powerhouse in a headscarf. The detainees have been emboldened by the changes beyond the wire, she says.\\n\"When news reached them [of the government take-over of al-Hol] everyone immediately came out of their tents, chanting \\'Allahu Akbar\\' [God is greatest]. The sound of their chanting echoed throughout the camp.\"\\nTaking her phone from her pocket she shows me pictures of the black and white IS flag, newly daubed on one of the walls of the camp. And she recounts threats made to staff. \"Statements were directed at us such as \\'We will return\\', \\'You are infidels\\', and \\'ISIS will end you,\\'\" she tells us.\\nShe warns that some in the camp – even the young – pose a threat to the world.\\n\"There was an incident last October involving twin brothers from Turkmenistan,\" she says. \"One killed the other and later said he would do it again if his brother came back to life.\"\\nThe reason – the slain brother was not radical enough.\\nBut in the camp\\'s cheerless food market we met women who pointed out that their children are guilty of nothing and pleaded for them to have a normal life. We spoke to two women from North Africa, who did not want to be identified.\\n\"I want to leave this place,\" one woman said, \"so my daughter can study and live her life. She has the right to an education, to visit a park, to get medical care. If she\\'s ill, God forbid, she should be able to go to hospital like any other child, without soldiers going with us.\"\\nWhen challenged about the fact that they themselves came to join IS, her friend jumped in. \"Firstly, I didn\\'t join the organisation,\" she said. \"My husband forced me to come here. He died, and my children and I are paying the price. Our children think the entire world is a camp behind a fence.\"\\nForty Britons remain trapped behind that fence – 25 children among them. We came across one of them – a polite boy speaking good English who we cannot identify. He shook hands with one of my BBC\\'s colleagues, and asked, \"How are you?\"\\nOne woman from the UK told us she wanted to go home but was afraid to be interviewed as camp guards were hovering. Two other British women refused to speak, including Shamima Begum, who left London as a schoolgirl to join IS. Camp staff told us Begum was \"hiding in her tent\".\\nRecalling her decision to come to IS territory, a Bosnian woman broke down and wept. \"I feel so bad because I came here with my husband, and I destroyed my life,\" she said. \"I can\\'t explain myself how I was stupid enough to come here. It was a mistake.\"\\nShe says her husband was not radical when they met in college but changed over time. By then they already had a child. Her second child was born in Syria.\\n\"We are really worried because we hear stories that there might be a war,\" she told us. \"We really hope they will fix this issue peacefully and that finally we can go back to our countries.\"\\nAs the sands shift in Syria countries that have been willing to leave their citizens in Kurdish camps indefinitely may have to think again – the UK included.\\nAdditional reporting by Wietske Burema, Goktay Koraltan and Bizhar Shareef\\n'},\n",

His fiancée Sapir Cohen, mother and grandmother were also kidnapped and taken to Gaza. The women were released after more than 50 days as hostages. He was freed a year ago, after 498 days in captivity.\\nIn his first international interview, Troufanov, on a visit to London, told BBC News that with the return on Monday of Ran Gvili\\'s body meaning all the hostages were back \"it felt wonderful. We waited so long for this to happen.\\n\"I was carrying this burden ever since I came back. It was like a weight on my shoulders that kept me from coming back to my life. Although we were released, we didn\\'t really come out of Gaza because our friends and brothers were still there.\"\\nBut the moment was bittersweet for him as Monday was also the birthday of his father Vitaly. Troufanov only discovered his father had been murdered on 7 October on the day he was released in February 2025 and realised his dad wasn\\'t there to meet him.\\nTroufanov and Cohen had been visiting his family on Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza when Palestinian gunmen stormed their homes. Cohen rolled herself up in blanket and hid under the bed but they were both captured. Troufanov was punched and also stabbed in the shoulder.\\n\"I saw the terrorist with so much anger and hate in his face, holding his knife trying to stab me even more.\"\\nAs the attackers tried to take Troufanov off the kibbutz he managed to momentarily escape but when he gave up running they still shot him twice in each leg.\\n\"I just felt the rush of pain going through my brain and I fell to the ground then one of the terrorists hit me with the rifle from the back of my head and split it open.\"\\nWhen he arrived to Gaza, he says he was then beaten by civilians and thought \"this is the moment you\\'re going to die\".\\nWhile in Gaza, Troufanov received almost no medical treatment. He was taken once to a family home and once to a hospital where his broken leg was wrapped first with a wooden broom and then with part of a metal grill.\\nUnlike many other hostages, he was held almost entirely in isolation. For only two of the 498 days in captivity did Troufanov see another hostage.\\nAt the start he was held above ground, for more than six weeks locked in a cage and given barely enough food to survive. Here, he says he experienced sexual harassment where one guard repeatedly tried to encourage him to do a sexual act on himself. He also says a hidden camera filmed him when he was allowed a shower once a week.\\n\"I noticed it and I took the shower trying to avoid my private parts towards this angle, but I had to do it because I needed to shower.\"\\nTaken underground to the tunnels, Troufanov says he was left for months alone, his captors only bringing food then leaving him in a silent, cramped, humid space so dark he couldn\\'t see his hand in front of his face.\\n\"I remember feeling that I am buried underneath the ground while I am still alive. I was losing it. I was having a hard time to find hope in this place. Many times I lost hope completely. I said to myself: \\'This is the last place you will see alive.\\'\"\\nIt is the first time since 2014 that there are no Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Two hundred and fifty-one people were taken captive during the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.\\nIsrael responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025, at least 492 Palestinians have been killed, the health ministry says, as well as four Israeli soldiers.\\nNow all the hostages, those alive and those who were killed, have returned to Israel the second phase of US President Donald Trump\\'s plan to end the war in Gaza can commence. The key Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is set to open on an ongoing basis for the first time since May 2024, as required under the plan.\\nIt also envisages the full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups; a technocratic Palestinian government; and the reconstruction of Gaza.\\nSasha Troufanov believes that these measures aren\\'t enough to ensure an attack like the one on 7 October won\\'t happen again.\\n\"Rebuilding Gaza, after what happened in the war, is understandable. But first of all we need to make sure that the people of Gaza will stop trying to hurt Israel. The terrorists were telling me: \\'We will do this again and again.\\'\\n\"Rebuilding Gaza and opening the Rafah crossing is in vain as it will never solve the real problem. We need to find a way to make this hatred and encouragement of terrorist activity stop.\"\\nThe former hostage now has to rehabilitate mentally and physically. He is currently on crutches after surgery on his leg but hopes to dance at his wedding to Sapir Cohen in a few weeks. \"It\\'s a victory: overcoming hate and fear and saying to ourselves: \\'We will build life together and we will continue.\\'\"\\n'},\n",

It warned the final toll could be several times higher, with a further 17,091 reported deaths currently being reviewed.\\nInternet rights observers say the unrest may have given the authorities an opportunity to accelerate long-planned efforts to tighten control over the internet - measures which would likely have faced far stronger resistance under normal circumstances.\\nAccording to sources cited by Shargh, internet access in Iran has effectively been divided into multiple levels - ranging from a complete shutdown to normal access - with current connectivity still far from a full restoration.\\nAccording to sources cited by the newspaper, foreign messaging apps, including WhatsApp, will remain restricted. There are some local communication platforms accessible inside the country, although observers have raised security and privacy concerns about their use.\\nHowever, in recent days some users have reported being able to connect intermittently to the outside world, using services such as Google Meet, Telegram, Facebook Messenger or FaceTime to contact family members.\\nRashidi said this may be because selectively granting access to certain parts of the internet can have the side effect of letting tools such as a virtual private network (VPN) function - even if briefly.\\nVPNs are ways to securely connect devices online, which can be used to view content blocked because of your location.\\n\"As long as there is any ability to transmit even a single bit of data, it is possible to find ways to use VPNs,\" Rashidi said.\\nBut he said the evidence so far suggests the authorities are determined to prevent VPNs from operating and to keep control over who can connect.\\nAfter nearly three weeks of internet disruption, Iran\\'s Minister of Communications Sattar Hashemi said on 26 January the daily losses caused by the shutdown amount to nearly five trillion tomans ($35m; £25m).\\nAmid mounting economic pressure, authorities appear to have introduced tightly controlled forms of internet access for some businesses, which analysts say may be part of a plan to manage connectivity more selectively.\\nBusiness figures told the BBC in some cities, members of the Chamber of Commerce are granted just 20 to 30 minutes of unfiltered internet access per day.\\nEven then, they claim this is only under supervision and after completing multiple stages of identity verification.\\nOne member of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the access was \"fully rationed and strictly time-limited\".\\nThey added if work was not completed within the allotted time, the entire verification process had to be repeated.\\nThe same source said some businesspeople had also been required to sign commitments not to send files related to the protests.\\nThey called the system \"effectively paralysing and humiliating\" given the number of people involved, and said it had generated widespread dissatisfaction among traders.\\nInternet freedom observers at FilterWatch have previously warned the authorities are rapidly putting in place new systems and rules aimed at cutting Iran off from the international internet.\\nAnd Madory said, looking at web traffic data, the patterns suggest a full restoration of internet access in Iran may never occur.\\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world\\'s top tech stories and trends.

We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital\\'s entrance.\\nHundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream.\\nProtesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran\\'s heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.\\nWe have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.\\nIn the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at.

One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.\\nFor most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX\\'s Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).\\nMore videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country\\'s economy has struggled during the blackout.\\nAdditional reporting BBC Persian.\\n'},\n",

And who will make up the international force delivering security for the future?\\nThis is the first time since 2014 there are no Israeli hostages, alive or dead, being held in Gaza - a reminder of the deep roots of this conflict and how difficult it could still be to shape a lasting peace.\\nReacting to the return of Gvili\\'s body, Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Just recovered the last Hostage body in GAZA. Thus, got back ALL 20 of the living Hostages, and ALL of the Dead! AMAZING JOB!\"\\nThe president said \"most thought of it as an impossible thing to do\" and congratulated his \"great team of Champions\".\\nHamas was meant to return all hostages, alive and dead, within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect. The process took far longer, but eventually 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 27 dead Israeli and foreign hostages were handed over, leaving only Gvili missing.\\nThe policeman was one of 251 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed.

These include locally based journalists working for the BBC.\\nDuring the deadliest ever war in Gaza, the foreign media have only been allowed to enter the territory on limited, restricted visits, accompanied by the Israeli military. Some of my BBC colleagues have taken part in these so-called military embeds.\\nAlmost all on-the-ground reporting and filming has been done by Palestinian journalists who were already in Gaza and have themselves been living through harsh conditions.\\nSince the departure of our long-time BBC staff members during the war, we have relied on a small team of trusted freelancers to help us with our work.\\nThe FPA has been pressing the Israeli government for journalists to be allowed to enter Gaza since early in the war. In 2024, it issued a petition, after which the Supreme Court granted the government several extensions to submit its response.\\nFinally, the court set 4 January as a final deadline for the authorities. In its submission, the government maintained that the ban should remain in place on security grounds.\\n\"Now we have a ceasefire, we\\'re saying it\\'s rather difficult to understand these security arguments,\" FPA chairperson and Deutsche Welle Jerusalem correspondent Tania Kraemer told me at the Supreme Court.\\n\"We want to go into Gaza. It\\'s our job to be there to talk to people. And that\\'s what we do the best - to be there doing first-hand reporting.\"\\nThe FPA has stressed that its demand for independent access does not detract from the work of Palestinian colleagues based in Gaza.\\n\"They have been displaced, they have taken risks, many journalists have been killed - we all know the numbers,\" Kraemer added.\\n\"We are saying they should not have to bear this burden alone and that we should be able to basically report alongside them.\"\\nIn previous times of war, the FPA has succeeded in pressing the Israeli government to allow access for journalists. This happened in early 2009, after some media teams had already managed to enter the strip from Egypt via the Rafah crossing.\\nDuring the six-week conflict between Israel and Hamas in 2014, I was among the journalists who signed a legal waiver so that the Israeli military would allow me to enter the Palestinian territory at a time of active hostilities.\\nAt that time, the BBC routinely shared the location of its office in Gaza City and hotels where we stayed with the Israeli military. We kept its press desk informed as we moved around in our armoured car and the FPA was able to co-ordinate buses to bring us in and out of the territory via Israel\\'s Erez crossing.\\nSuch efforts reduced - but did not totally prevent - dangerous encounters with Israeli troops and Hamas fighters.\\nAccording to media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders, more than 220 Palestinian journalists have been killed since the start of the Gaza war, including at least 68 killed while working.\\nThe Israeli military says it only targets members of armed Palestinian groups and military sites.\\nA week ago, an Israeli strike south of Gaza City killed three freelance journalists who worked with international news agencies while they were filming: Mohammed Qashta, Anas Ghneim and Abdul Raouf Shaat.\\nThe military said it attacked \"several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas... in a manner that posed a threat\" to its forces and that the incident was under examination.\\nBoth Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists, another NGO, have filed briefs with the Israeli court to grant media access immediately. They have argued that keeping journalists out of Gaza sets a \"dangerous precedent\".\\n'},\n",

People were chanting \\'Death to the dictator\\' and \\'Long live the shah\\'.\" The \"dictator\" was Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran\\'s late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.\\nIsfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency.\\nFirst, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said. Then they formed a line and fired birdshot.\\n\"I saw people getting shot and falling down, and I saw blood on the street.\"\\nParnia said she ran away down alleyways and was suddenly pulled into an apartment block by a woman. Inside, she said, were many injured protesters.\\n\"I saw the lobby floor covered in blood, and I saw a girl whose leg was full of pellets.\"\\nVideos verified by the BBC from that night show large numbers of people in the streets in Isfahan. Some streets were blocked by traffic sign poles and large metal sheets, in an apparent effort by protesters to protect themselves from gunfire.\\nFootage also showed protesters breaking through the gates of the building of the national broadcaster Irib, which was later set on fire.\\nOn Friday morning, 9 January, Khamenei said Iran would not back down from dealing with what he called \"destructive elements\", a day after US President Donald Trump had threatened to hit Iran \"very hard\" if authorities started killing people.\\nFollowing Khamenei\\'s speech, the powerful Revolutionary Guards sent a text message to people across Iran, telling them to avoid gatherings on streets in areas of unrest. The messages also warned against co-operating with what it described as \"terrorist mercenaries\" - an act it said would constitute treason.\\nDespite the risks, Parnia went out to protest again on Friday evening.\\n\"The protesters were hopeful,\" she said. \"You could see fear on everyone\\'s faces. We were afraid to pass in front of the security forces and come closer together,\" she said.\\n\"We thought even if we get killed, it would be a reason for Trump to act faster.\"\\nFootage obtained by the BBC from the previous day shows large crowds on main streets in Parnia\\'s neighbourhood. But she said on the Friday it was different.\\n\"Protesters were in small groups gathered in alleyways. Every time that someone tried to gather in the larger street, we could hear live fire sound followed by screams and shouts.\"\\nBecause of the internet blackouts, and protesters avoiding taking their phones with them, the BBC has not yet obtained footage from Friday night.\\nParnia also described a scene of \"total chaos\" at a local clinic that was treating wounded protesters.\\n\"No phone lines were working. Nobody could call their families, and many refused to go to hospitals, fearing they could be arrested there,\" she said.\\n\"All the nurses could do was clean the wounds and send them home. The next day you could still smell the tear gasses in the air. Security forces were present and there were checkpoints across the city.\"\\nParnia left Isfahan that same day and travelled to the capital, Tehran, to catch a flight back to London.\\n\"I arrived in Tehran at 6pm. All the shops were closed and many people gathered in the streets. At 8pm everyone started to chant and I could hear gunshots,\" she said.\\n\"The airport was so busy. Many foreign airlines were cancelled and people were frustrated. Luckily, I found an Iranian flight to leave.\"\\nSince her return to the UK, Parnia has been in touch with her friends in Isfahan.\\nShe said she learned from a source that doctors at Feiz eye hospital in Isfahan had carried out around 300 surgical procedures to remove the eyes of patients with birdshot-related facial injuries.\\n\"Every time you go out into the streets, you see random people with eye patches,\" Parnia\\'s friends told her.\\nAccording to several health workers who spoke to the BBC, hospitals are monitored and controlled by security forces, and people with gunshot wounds in Isfahan are being arrested.\\n\"Many of the injured are developing infections. Some doctors are referring them to surgeons who can treat them in private clinics,\" Parnia\\'s cited her friends as saying.\\nWhile Iranian authorities have said around 3,000 people were killed during the protests, US-based human rights group HRANA has so far confirmed more than 4,600 deaths, with another 9,700 cases still under review. According to the group, at least 7,300 people have also sustained serious injuries. Many believe the true figures may be even higher.\\nParnia said she was now preparing to join Iranian opposition protests in the UK, saying she wants to be a voice for the silenced protesters.\\nShe also expressed anger at international media reports suggesting that Iranians and the country\\'s political opposition was not united.\\n\"Iranians have shown what they want in the streets and paid a high price for it.\"\\n'},\n",

UAE forces pulled out of Yemen in early January and Yemeni government forces and groups allied to them have retaken large swathes of the south from separatists backed by the UAE.\\nThis includes the port of Mukalla, where we landed in a Saudi military plane and were taken to visit the former UAE military bases in the Al-Dhaba Oil Export Area.\\nIt has been almost impossible for international journalists to get visas to report from Yemen in recent years, but the government invited reporters to view the two sites, accompanied by Yemen\\'s Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani.\\nWhat we saw was consistent with accounts we have gathered independently, both in our previous reporting and also interviews conducted in Yemen, separately from the government-run site visit.\\nAt one site, there were about 10 shipping containers, their interiors painted black, with little ventilation.\\nMessages on the walls appeared to mark the dates detainees said they were brought in, or to count the number of days they had been held.\\nSeveral were dated as recently as December 2025.\\nAt another military base, the BBC was shown eight cells built from brick and cement, including several measuring about one metre square and two metres tall, which Eryani said were used for solitary confinement.\\nHuman rights groups have documented testimony describing such facilities for years.\\nYemeni lawyer Huda al-Sarari has been gathering accounts.\\nThe BBC independently attended a meeting she organised, where about 70 people were present who said they had been held in Mukalla, as well as the families of another 30 who they said their relatives were still in detention.\\nSeveral former detainees told us that each shipping container could hold up to 60 men at a time.\\nThey said prisoners were blindfolded, bound at the wrists and forced to remain sitting upright at all hours.\\n\"There was no space to lie down,\" one former prisoner told the BBC. \"If someone collapsed, the others had to hold him up.\"\\nThe man also told the BBC he was beaten for three days after his arrest, with interrogators demanding he confess to being a member of al-Qaeda - an accusation he denies.\\n\"They told me if I didn\\'t admit it, I would be sent to \\'Guantanamo\\',\" he said, referring to the US military detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.\\n\"I didn\\'t even know what they meant by Guantanamo until they took me to their prison. Then I understood.\"\\nHe said he was held there for a year and a half, beaten daily and abused.\\n\"They didn\\'t even feed us properly,\" he said. \"If you wanted the toilet, they took you once. Sometimes you were so desperate you did it on yourself.\"\\nHe says his captors included Emirati soldiers as well as Yemeni fighters: \"All types of torture - when we were interrogated it was the worst. They even sexually abused us and said they would bring in the \\'doctor\\'.\\n\"This so-called doctor was Emirati. He beat us and told the Yemeni soldiers to beat us too. I tried to kill myself multiple times to make it end.\"\\nThe UAE was leading a counter-terror campaign in southern Yemen, but human rights groups say thousands of people were detained in crackdowns on political activists and critics.\\nA mother told us her son was detained as a teenager and has been held for nine years.\\n\"My son was an athlete,\" she said. \"He had just come back from competing abroad. That day he went to the gym and never came back.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t hear from him for seven months,\" she said.\\n\"Then they let me see him for 10 minutes. I could see all the scars of the torture.\"\\nShe alleged that in the prison at the Emirati-run base, her teenage son was electrocuted, doused with ice-cold water and sexually abused multiple times.\\nShe says she attended a hearing in which her son\\'s accusers played a recording of him apparently confessing.\\n\"You can hear him being beaten in the background and told what to say,\" she said. \"My son is not a terrorist. You have robbed him of the best years of his life.\"\\nOver the past decade, human rights groups and media organisations - including the BBC and Associated Press - have documented allegations of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture in detention centres run by the UAE and its allies.\\nHuman Rights Watch said in 2017 it had gathered testimonies of detainees held without charge or judicial oversight in unofficial facilities, and subjected to beatings, electric shocks and other forms of ill treatment.\\nThe UAE denied these allegations when they were made.\\nThe BBC sent detailed allegations to the UAE government about the detention sites we visited and accounts of abuse, but received no response.\\nAll sides have been accused of human rights violations in the civil war, which has sparked a devastating humanitarian crisis in the country.\\nFamilies of detainees told the BBC they had repeatedly raised concerns with Yemeni authorities.\\nThey believe it would have been impossible for the UAE and its allies to run a detention network without the Yemeni government and its Saudi backers knowing about it.\\nThe information minister, Eryani, said: \"We weren\\'t able to access locations that were under UAE control until now.\\n\"When we liberated them we discovered these prisons… we had been told by many victims that they existed but we didn\\'t believe it was true.\"\\nHis government\\'s decision to give access to international media comes as the rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE is widening.\\nTheir long-strained relationship deteriorated in December when UAE-backed southern separatists, the Southern Transition Council (STC), seized territory controlled by government forces in two western provinces.\\nSaudi Arabia then carried out a strike on what it said was a shipment of weapons from the UAE to the STC in Mukalla, and backed a demand from Yemen\\'s presidential council for Emirati forces to leave the country immediately.\\nThe UAE withdrew and within days government forces and their allies retook control of the western provinces as well as all of the south.\\nHowever, remaining separatists threaten the government\\'s position in some places, including the southern port of Aden.\\nThe UAE denied that the shipment had contained weapons and also Saudi allegations that it was behind the STC\\'s recent military campaign.\\nOn 12 January 2026, the president of Yemen\\'s Presidential Leadership Council, which oversees the government, Rashad al-Alimi, ordered the closure of all \"illegal\" prisons in southern provinces previously controlled by the STC, demanding the immediate release of those \"held outside the framework of the law\".\\nEryani said some detainees had been discovered inside the facilities, but did not give numbers or further details.\\nSome relatives - including the mother of the athlete - told the BBC that detainees have since been transferred to prisons now nominally under government control.\\nYemeni authorities say transferring prisoners into the formal justice system is complex, while rights groups warn arbitrary detention may simply continue under different control.\\n\"The terrorists are out on the streets,\" the mother said.\\n\"Our sons are not terrorists.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'President Ahmed al-Sharaa has made significant advances in his efforts to unify a deeply fractured Syria, reclaiming large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under the control of a Kurdish-led militia alliance for more than a decade. What happens next will be a test for a government that has tried to assert its authority over the whole country.\\nThe gains by government forces in a lightning offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) marked the biggest change of control in Syria since Islamist-led rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending the 13-year civil war. Before this month\\'s push, nearly a third of Syria\\'s territory was controlled by the Kurds, who enjoyed American support after helping a US-led coalition defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in the last decade. There, they ran an enclave with its own government and institutions, with the SDF being its military arm.\\nThe offensive came amid stalled talks between Sharaa\\'s government and the SDF about the key issue of integrating its forces into the country\\'s institutions. A deal was signed last March, but a year-end deadline expired with little progress as the SDF remained reluctant to give up its autonomy. The militia alliance, analysts say, miscalculated in its negotiations with the government, seeming to believe it would have the backing of its longtime ally.\\nBut the US under President Donald Trump has strongly supported Sharaa, who has defended his vision of a united Syria under the control of Damascus. Trump hosted Sharaa, who was once branded a terrorist by the US for his former links to al-Qaeda, at the White House last year, and lifted devastating sanctions imposed on Syria in the Assad years. When Sharaa\\'s forces started their push, there was no apparent US objection.\\nOn Sunday, after suffering stunning territorial losses, the SDF agreed on a 14-point deal that reversed almost all concessions it had gained from the government in earlier negotiations. Crucially, its members are expected to join the Syrian army and interior ministry as individuals - and not as separate units, as it had demanded - while the control of oil and gas fields, important for Syria\\'s economic recovery, will be transferred to the government. SDF-run prisons and camps holding thousands of IS detainees and family members are also being brought under Damascus\\' control.\\nThe announcement came days after Sharaa issued a decree that was seen as an attempt to reach out to the Kurds, whose rights had been denied in the five-decade rule by the Assads: it designated Kurdish as a national language, granted Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declared the Nowruz - the Persian new year - a national holiday.\\nFighting, however, erupted again. So far, the areas reclaimed by government forces have been mainly Arab, where locals had resentments against the SDF. But the troops continued to move towards Kurdish-majority areas, raising the prospect of deadly clashes, and reportedly angering Washington. On Tuesday, Sharaa\\'s government suddenly announced a ceasefire, giving the SDF four days to present a detailed plan for the integration of areas under its control into the state. This halted the move of his army and prevented the escalation of the violence, for now.\\nSince coming to power after the fall of the Assad regime, Sharaa has repeatedly vowed to protect Syria\\'s minorities. But the country has seen deadly bouts of sectarian violence. Last year, government forces were accused of atrocities after being sent to the Mediterranean coast, which is the heartland of Assad\\'s Alawite sect, and the mainly Druze southern province of Suweida. Kurds fear the same could happen to them, despite renewed guarantees offered by Sharaa.\\nFor the Kurds, the losses are a fatal blow to the aspirations of preserving their autonomy, with the US position being seen as a betrayal. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy, said the \"original purpose\" of the partnership with the SDF, as the main anti-IS force in Syria, had \"largely expired\", and that the \"greatest opportunity for the Kurds in Syria\" lay in the transition under Sharaa, whose government is seen by Western countries as the best chance to guarantee Syria\\'s stability.\\nThe dramatic changes empower Sharaa but are likely to renew calls for him to decentralise authority, with critics saying key posts have been limited to his allies. It could also indicate what he may be planning to do in other areas of the country, including those held by the Druze, who demand autonomy.\\n'},\n",

One man\\'s face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment.\\nSome victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming.\\nMany photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims\\' last remaining possession.\\nBBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show.\\nSome Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.\\nWe checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims\\' families.\\nBBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.\\nThe few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests.\\nThe internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': '\"They\\'re shooting at me. Please come get me. I\\'m scared.\"\\nWhen filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania first heard the emergency phone call recording of Hind Rajab, a frightened six-year-old Palestinian girl begging for help while under siege in Gaza City in 2024, on social media, she says she immediately knew what she had to do.\\nHitting pause on the movie she was about to make, the Tunisian two-time Oscar-nominee called her producer and they agreed to shift focus to telling the story of the girl, who was killed - likely by Israeli fire, according to a number of media investigations - along with her aunt, uncle and cousins, and two paramedics sent to save her.\\n\"It haunted me,\" Ben Hania tells BBC News about the voice recording, which is the centrepiece of her Oscar-shortlisted docudrama, released in UK cinemas last Friday.\\n\"I was really angry, I was sad, I felt helpless, and I hate it when I feel helpless.\\n\"I asked myself this basic question, what can I do? I\\'m a filmmaker, so I can do movies.\"\\nShe adds: \"We started working on The Voice of Hind Rajab that way to not feel helpless, to not accept, to bear witness.\\n\"Because not doing it, for me, was being complicit in a way.\"\\nHind Rajab\\'s car was hit by suspected Israeli fire as she and her family tried to flee bombing during the two-year war in Gaza.\\nSeveral family members were killed, but Hind managed to answer a callback from the helpers at the Palestinian Red Crescent Society.\\nThe ambulance trying to reach her was also shelled, and Hind, her family, and the ambulance crew all died.\\nThe Israel Defence Force initially stated none of its troops had been in the area where Hind and the others were killed.\\nBut that suggestion was questioned following independent investigations by research agency Forensic Architecture, in colloboration with NGO (Non-Governmental Organisation) Earshot and journalists from Al Jazeera, which concluded that damage to both the car and the ambulance was consistent with Israeli tank fire.\\nThe IDF later said it had \"conducted raids on terror targets\" with forces operating in neighbourhoods in Gaza City, including Tel al Hawa, from where Hind had made her emergency call.\\nThe UN cited her case in a commission of inquiry accusing Israel of war crimes, which it denies.\\nAn IDF spokesperson told the BBC it is still being reviewed by Israel\\'s Fact-Finding Assessment Mechanism (FFAM).\\nBen Hania\\'s film sets out to tell the story - in Arabic and English - of what happened to Hind and her family, from the perspective of the Red Crescent volunteers at the Ramallah call centre in the occupied West Bank.\\nIt is \"based on true events\" and \"anchored in truth\", Ben Hania says.\\n\"At some point, with all this proof, I thought that we are done explaining\", she adds.\\n\"Cinema can do something better, which is provoking empathy.\"\\nThe feature mixes audio of the girl\\'s heart-rending real final phonecalls with the Red Crescent, with a visual dramatisation using actors to represent the volunteers.\\nThey try to keep her calm and conscious as it becomes clear she is surrounded by the dead bodies of her relatives.\\nCritics have praised the emotional impact of the performances, while noting the problems inherent with mixing documentary with drama.\\nVariety\\'s Guy Lodge said it was \"impossible not to be moved\" by the recording at the heart of the hybrid film, heard at an \"agonising distance\".\\nBut he felt \"the ethics and execution of the concept are questionable\".\\nIn a four-star review, The Telegraph\\'s Robbie Collin said the feature \"transcends shock value\" and presents viewers with \"an ethical dilemma\".\\n\"I dreaded watching this film,\" he wrote. \"Yet having now seen it, I find my mind changed, thanks largely to the philosophical diligence of Ben Hania\\'s approach.\"\\nThe director - who received the blessing of Hind\\'s mother, Wesam, before making the movie - says she did her best to \"respect the testimony\" of the volunteers and what they told her about that day.\\nShe did not reach out to the other side, because, she says: \"My movie is not an investigation.\\n\"The investigation was already done,\" she adds, with reference to aforementioned findings, as well as those made by other major news providers including the Washington Post and Sky News.\\nIncreasingly stressed scenes play out in the film between call centre worker Omar, played by Motaz Malhees, and his boss Mahdi, played by Amer Hlehel.\\nMahdi is seeking a safe route approved by the Israeli army - via intermediaries - for his paramedics to make the eight-minute journey to carry out the rescue attempt.\\nOmar becomes exasperated at his boss\\'s insistence on trying to negotiate with Israel.\\nActresses Saja Kilani and Clara Khoury, as fellow call centre workers Rana and Nisreen, respectively, complete the ensemble cast of actors of Palestinian origin.\\nWe watch them hear the sound of gunfire or an explosion in the background before the phone connection is lost entirely.\\n\"Even the actors, at some point, stop acting,\" says their director. \"They weren\\'t performing.\"\\nMalhees confirms this. He tells us he suffered panic attacks during filming and thought his heart was \"going to explode\" during one scene, which for him was \"like a real conversation with a child\".\\n\"It was a hard experience, but it\\'s worth everything to give.\"\\nHis director stresses she wanted to share with the audience what she had felt the first time she had heard the girl\\'s call for help. \"I thought that she was almost talking to me, to save her\".\\nShe told herself: \"I need to go back to this moment when it was possible to save her.\" Before \"the war, mainly, failed her\".\\nIn another four-star review, the Guardian\\'s Peter Bradshaw said there is \"a reckless, ruthless kind of provocative brilliance in what Ben Hania is doing\".\\nHe wrote: \"Is it in bad taste? Problematic? Well, in a world where directors busy themselves and us with made-up stories about made-up people, Ben Hania is at least grabbing one of the most relevant issues of our time with both hands and finding a way to thrust it under our noses.\"\\nThe main question for Ben Hania when making the film was always: \"How to make the voice of this little girl echo?\", she explains.\\n\"Because the world don\\'t want to hear it. It\\'s not a comfortable thing to face.\\n\"And for me, it was important to honour her voice and to make it resonate beyond borders.\"\\nWorried that it would be perceived as \"niche\", the filmmakers reached out to some famous Hollywood faces - including Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara - who signed up as executive producers.\\nPhoenix and Mara were in attendance when the film received a record 23-minute standing ovation following its September world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, where it also won the grand jury prize.\\n\"I was like, when will they will stop?\" recalls Ben Hania of the \"incredible reaction\".\\n\"And actually they stopped because the theatre asked us to leave, because there was another movie!\"\\n\"There was a moment of solidarity for real,\" adds Mahlees. \"You could feel that the people are there with you. You are not alone in this world.\"\\nTwo of Ben Hania\\'s previous films - 2024\\'s Four Daughters about teenage sisters who joined IS, and 2021\\'s The Man Who Sold His Skin, about a Syrian refugee who becomes a conceptual art object - were nominated for Academy Awards.\\nHer Golden Globe-nominated latest film is expected to get an Oscar nomination on Thursday, for best international feature, which the director hopes would help the whole world to remember the name Hind Rajab - as the process of trying to find a lasting peace in Gaza continues.\\n\"We don\\'t have stars, it\\'s not a feel-good movie,\" says Ben Hania.\\n\"I think it\\'s important to not look away, because this is not a story: this is history in the making.\"\\nThe Voice of Hind Rajab is out in UK cinemas now.\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Syria\\'s government has announced a new ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), after the militia alliance withdrew from a camp holding thousands of people with alleged links to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS).\\nThe SDF said its forces were \"compelled\" to leave al-Hol camp and redeploy to other cities in north-east Syria \"due to the international indifference toward the issue of [IS]\".\\nSyria\\'s interior ministry complained that it took place without co-ordination with the government or US-led coalition against IS.\\nLater, the presidency said it had reached an \"understanding\" with the SDF on the future of Hassakeh province, which has a large Kurdish population.\\nA statement said the SDF would be given four days to carry out consultations on a detailed plan for the peaceful integration of areas under its control into the state.\\nThe presidency also promised that government forces would not enter the cities of Hassakeh and Qamishli, or any Kurdish villages.\\nAt the same time, the SDF declared its \"full commitment to the ceasefire\" and said its forces would not initiate any military action unless they were attacked.\\nThe SDF also said it was ready to \"move forward with implementing\" the deal reached with the government on Sunday that was supposed to end almost two weeks of fighting.\\nThe agreement should see the Kurdish-run autonomous region in the country\\'s north-east and its key infrastructure brought under government control, as well as the integration of the tens of thousands of SDF fighters into the defence and interior ministries\\' forces.\\nIt represents a major blow for the SDF, which had been reluctant to give up the autonomy that it won for Syria\\'s Kurdish minority when helping US-led coalition forces defeat IS militarily during the country\\'s 13-year civil war.\\nInterim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify Syria since he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, but the country remains deeply divided and has been rocked by waves of deadly sectarian violence.\\nThe SDF announced its withdrawal from al-Hol camp as Syrian army and interior ministry forces advanced deep into Hassakeh province after taking control of Deir al-Zour and Raqqa.\\n\"Due to the international indifference toward the issue of the IS terrorist organisation and the failure of the international community to assume its responsibilities in addressing this serious matter, our forces were compelled to withdraw from al-Hol camp and redeploy in the vicinity of cities in northern Syria that are facing increasing risks and threats,\" it said.\\nIn a statement sent to Kurdish news agency Hawar, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi urged the US-led coalition - once his main ally - to \"bear its responsibilities in protecting facilities\".\\n\"We withdrew to predominantly Kurdish areas and protecting them is a red line,\" he added.\\nThe Syrian interior ministry said the SDF units had pulled out of al-Hol without any co-ordination in an \"attempt to pressure the government over the fight against terrorism\".\\nThe ministry added that it was \"taking all necessary measures in co-ordination and co-operation with the international coalition to maintain security and stability\".\\nThe defence ministry also said it was ready to assume control of the camp as well as all prisons holding suspected IS fighters in the region.\\nBefore the fighting with the government erupted earlier this month, the SDF was holding about 8,000 suspected IS fighters at prisons in north-eastern Syria.\\nAround 34,000 people linked to IS were also being detained at al-Hol and another camp, Roj, the UN reported last August. The population of the camps, of which 60% were children, comprised 6,700 Iraqis, 15,500 Syrians and 8,500 citizens of other countries, including the UK.\\nThe SDF, US and UN have long called for the repatriation of the foreign IS suspects and their families from north-eastern Syria, citing the political instability and dire conditions in the prisons and camps, but many countries have refused to take them.\\nEarlier, the government and SDF traded accusations over the escape of suspected IS fighters from an SDF-run prison in Shaddadi, in southern Hassakeh province.\\nThe interior ministry said on Monday night that its special forces and army soldiers had entered the town following \"the escape of around 120 [IS] terrorists\" from the prison. Search operations by the security forces resulted in the arrest of 81 of the fugitives, it added.\\nThe SDF said it had lost control of Shaddadi prison in the afternoon after \"Damascus-affiliated factions\" mounted a series of attacks and killed of dozens of its fighters, who it said had been attempting to \"prevent a serious security catastrophe\".\\nSDF spokesman Farhad Shami said around 1,500 IS members had escaped during the clashes, according to Reuters news agency.\\nThe SDF also accused government forces of attacking al-Aqtan prison, north of the city of Raqqa, which is holding IS members and leaders.\\nOn Tuesday, a statement said the prison\\'s buildings and facilities had been shelled and its water supply cut off. \"These practices constitute a blatant violation of humanitarian standards and pose a serious threat to the lives of the detainees,\" it warned.\\nHowever, the defence ministry denied that there had been clashes in the vicinity of the prison.\\nIt said the facility was \"fully secured\", with military police and internal security forces deployed around the facility and in contact with the administration to ensure supplies were provided.\\nThe US, which was once the SDF\\'s main ally in Syria, was monitoring developments in Syria with \"grave concern\", a White House official said.\\n\"We urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint, avoid actions that could further escalate tensions, and prioritize the protection of civilians across all minority groups,\" they added.\\nSpecial envoy Tom Barrack meanwhile explained that the rationale for the US-SDF partnership had \"largely expired\", and that his country was currently focused on ensuring the security of facilities holding IS prisoners and facilitating talks between the SDF and President Sharaa\\'s government on implementation of the ceasefire deal.\\n\"This moment offers a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation - long denied under Bashar al-Assad\\'s regime,\" he wrote on X.\\nAfter signing the deal with the SDF on Sunday, Sharaa said he hoped it would allow Syria to \"end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress\". However, Abdi said the fighting had been \"imposed on us\" and that he had accepted the deal \"to stop the bloodshed\".\\n'},\n",

Hundreds of staff have been laid off in recent weeks.\\nIsrael, though, is doubling down, saying the \"possession and evacuation\" of other Unrwa buildings will follow.\\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has already threatened to take Israel to the International Court of Justice over its laws targeting Unrwa and its assets.\\nThe demolition marks a significant widening of the rift.\\nCorrection 9 February 2026: This article originally said that the law banning Unrwa from operating in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem was passed last year. It was passed in October 2024, as we reported at the time, and the article has been amended accordingly.

       "  'Article': 'A Palestinian children\\'s football club in the occupied West Bank faces imminent demolition despite an international campaign to save it. Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players.\\nBut Israel insists it\\'s been built without the necessary permits.\\nIn this deeply divided land so much is contested; from the identities and faiths of the people who live here, to every inch of the ground they stand on.\\nRecently, that has come to include one small patch of artificial turf laid down under the shadow of the giant concrete wall that isolates Israel from much of the occupied West Bank.\\nIn the context of the 7 October attacks, the two-year war in Gaza and the fragility of the current ceasefire, there are without doubt far more pressing issues.\\nBut this is a story freighted with symbolism and one which has drawn outsized international attention because of its connection to that other world religion - football.\\nOn the day we visit, a group of Palestinian children are lining up to take penalty shots in the winter sunshine.\\nThe construction of the pitch began here on the edge of Bethlehem in 2020, and today it provides a place to practise for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp.\\nThe cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.\\nOn 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day\\'s training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal.\\nThe notice was followed soon by a demolition order.\\n\"We don\\'t have anywhere else to play,\" 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back.\\n\"We are building our dreams here,\" she said. \"If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.\"\\nI asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction.\\n\"I was upset,\" he told me. \"This is a field I really care for.\"\\nThe community has fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures, and receiving messages of international support.\\nThe club says that after representations from a lawyer it was recently given a seven-day reprieve.\\nBut that extension expired on Monday, leaving it with a difficult choice.\\nAs is common practice in such cases, the club owners must either demolish the pitch themselves or wait for the Israeli authorities to do it forcibly, after which they\\'ll be presented with the bill.\\nThe looming presence of the wall, which runs along the length of one of the touchlines, is just one of the many complex layers that underpin the Israeli occupation of the territory that Palestinians want as the basis for a future state.\\nMilitarily, Israel exerts control over the entirety of the West Bank.\\nBut administrative control – its day-to-day governance – is divided between a patchwork of Palestinian-run areas and Israeli-run ones.\\nThe maps on which those distinctions are based were drawn up as a key part of the Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).\\nThe West Bank was split into three categories of territory.\\nAreas A and B were pockets of land over which the Palestinian Authority was given civil control.\\nIn those marked as Area A, Palestinians were also given nominal security control.\\nArea C – more than 60% of the total – was to remain temporarily under full Israeli control.\\nThe idea was that it would eventually be gradually transferred to Palestinian self-rule as the negotiations continued.\\nWhile that never happened, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the peace process, the maps remain the basis for much of how the West Bank is governed today.\\nBethlehem itself is designated as Area A.\\nBut the maps show Israel exercising Area C civil authority over much of the surrounding countryside, right up the city\\'s edge.\\nIsrael began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis.\\nCritics claim that today, as it has grown in length, the wall has become a tool for punishing many thousands of ordinary Palestinians, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land.\\nBut what\\'s now in contention in Bethlehem is a tiny, narrow patch of ground on the Palestinian side of the wall.\\nFor the residents of the Aida camp looking for space to build a football field, it was just large enough to accommodate their needs.\\nBut for Israel it remains – and is marked on the maps – as part of Area C, even though the construction of the wall has left it marooned on the Bethlehem side.\\nSatellite photos show that the space was vacant in 2019 and then, year by year, the pitch can be seen beginning to take shape, fitting in snuggly right up against the wall.\\nThe demolition order argues that it was built without the necessary permissions on a plot of land over which Israel still asserts full civil control.\\nFor Palestinians, there is no small irony in the fact that they\\'re being denied the right to build a small football pitch on the boundary of their city, inside the wall that fences them in.\\nWhile turning down permission for their buildings and demolishing existing ones, Israel continues to approve the construction of vast new Israeli settlements across Area C, which are considered illegal under international law.\\nLast September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed an agreement to push ahead with a major and highly controversial settlement that will house 20,000 Israelis.\\nLocated between occupied East Jerusalem and the already existing settlement of Maale Adumim, if completed it would effectively cut the West Bank in half which, Palestinians say, will all but destroy their aspirations for nationhood.\\nThe Israeli government agrees.\\n\"There will be no Palestinian state,\" Netanyahu said at the signing ceremony. \"This place belongs to us.\"\\nSome of his ministers speak openly of the full annexation of the West Bank.\\nIn Bethlehem, the football club – which claims it did receive verbal permission in 2020 for the pitch – believes the threat of demolition is about far more than planning law.\\n\"The Israelis don\\'t want us to have any kind of hope, they don\\'t want us to have any opportunity,\" Mohammad Abu Srour, one of the board members of the Aida Youth Centre, told me.\\nThe idea, he suggested, was to make life deliberately hard.\\n\"The moment that we lose hope and opportunity we are going to leave. This is the only explanation for us.\"\\nWe approached the Israeli body that manages civilian affairs in the West Bank for comment.\\nAlthough the demolition order was issued on its behalf, we were referred instead to the Israeli military, which oversees its work.\\nThe IDF gave us the following statement.\\n\"Along the security fence, there is a confiscation order and a prohibition on construction; therefore, the construction in the area was carried out unlawfully,\" it said.\\nAs they wait to see what happens next, the children of Aida hope that the international attention might be enough to sway the authorities\\' minds.\\nBut for now, as the wider conflict grinds on, the future of one small football pitch is hanging in the balance.\\n'},\n",

It also reports that the number of arrests has reached 24,266 across 187 cities.\\nThe real number of people killed and detained is believed to be significantly higher, but the lack of access means the figures cannot be independently verified.\\nInternet monitoring project, FilterWatch, says that the latest shutdown spells the start of a more extreme \"digital isolation\" and increased surveillance on what is said, sent and viewed online.\\nAmir Rashidi, director of cyber security and digital rights at the Miaan Group, which runs FilterWatch, told the BBC he believes the authorities are moving towards a tiered system in which access to the global internet would no longer be automatic but subject to approval.\\nAccess would be granted through a registration and vetting process, he expects, adding that the technical infrastructure for such a system has been in place for years.\\nAccording to FilterWatch, the plans are not being spoken about publicly, with key decisions increasingly concentrated within security bodies rather than civilian ministries.\\nProtecting Iran from cyber attacks - of which there have been many high profile and disruptive cases in recent years - may be another motivation for the extreme moves.\\nHowever, analysts caution that the plans may not fully materialise or could be applied unevenly due to internal power dynamics and broader economic and technical pressures.\\nAmir Rashidi notes that risks to internet providers, alongside users\\' ability to adapt or migrate to alternative platforms, could further complicate implementation.\\nIf Iran goes ahead with the plans being reported on, it will be following similar systems in Russia and China.\\nChina has led the world on internet control not just with enormous state censorship over online discussion but also with what people are able to access abroad.\\nThe so-called Great Chinese Firewall blocks citizens from much of the global internet and all western apps like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube are not reachable without VPNs - but they are also becoming harder to use.\\nIn 2019, Russia began testing for a grand plan to create a similar system dubbed Ru-net.\\nBut unlike China, which built state control into the internet as the web spread decades ago, Russia is having to retrofit state control into complex systems.\\nRussia is going a step further than China and planning to switch itself off from the world wide web with a \"kill switch\", which will apparently be used at times of crisis.\\nThe system will allow internal internet traffic and keep the country moving online but without traffic going outside or in - a digital border in effect. But it has yet to be fully tested.\\nIf the reports are accurate, it seems that Iran is planning to a quasi combination of permanent Chinese and Russian internet control.\\n\"In Iran there seems to be a move to isolate everyone from any electronic access, unless approved by the government,\" said computer security expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University in the UK, after reviewing the reports of Iran\\'s plans.\\nHe believes the Iranian regime has probably moved ahead with its longer term plans, using the current blackout as a reason to make the technical switches and orders now, whilst everything is cut off.\\nAmir Rashidi says the question is no longer technical, but political - arguing that whether such systems are fully implemented now depends on political will.\\nStarlink and other internet-from-space services, known as Low Earth Orbit (LEO), have also complicated control for Iran during the protests.\\nLEO internet services allow users to get around all censorship and shutdowns by connecting via satellites.\\nThe government was able to jam and interfere with some Starlink users but it has been confirmed to the BBC that other terminals remain operational after the company updated its firmware to bypass government blocking efforts.\\nThe service, which is owned by Elon Musk, also waived subscription fees for Iranian users.\\nIn spite of the increasing tools being used by repressive regimes, Woodward is surprisingly optimistic about the future of internet.\\nHe cites advances in LEO and the fact that many phones can now use satellites even when the internet is down for things like SOS messages.\\nThere are also emerging apps that use mesh networks relying on Bluetooth, which can bring connectivity where there is none.\\n\"Its almost inevitable that internet access will be truly universal eventually but it\\'ll always be cat and mouse for repressive regimes\", Woodward says.\\n'},\n",

The other, called the \"Gaza Executive Board\", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).\\nThat committee is made up of supposedly technocratic, apolitical Palestinians, led by Dr Ali Shaath, a civil engineer by training who\\'s held ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority.\\nBut of the seven members of the founding Executive Board, six are Americans - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other members of Trump\\'s inner circle like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, who is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, but also a friend of the president and a fellow real estate developer.\\nAjay Banga, president of the World Bank, is something of an exception as an Indian-born US citizen. Sir Tony Blair, meanwhile, is a former UK Prime Minister, and his inclusion is likely to further fuel concerns about how the Board of Peace will operate.\\nOver the past few weeks, criticism of Sir Tony\\'s possible inclusion has come from figures like prominent politician Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, and newspaper reports quoting unnamed officials from Arab states in the region.\\nSir Tony\\'s central role in the Iraq war, coupled with Britain\\'s own colonial history in the Middle East, is deemed by his opponents to make him entirely unsuitable.\\nFrancesca Albanese, the United Nations\\' special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on social media last year: \"Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine.\"\\nEven Trump seemed to acknowledge the issue.\\n\"I\\'ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he\\'s an acceptable choice to everybody,\" the president said last October.\\nThere is significant overlap between the two senior boards, with Kushner, Witkoff and Sir Tony appearing on both.\\nBut the Gaza Executive Board does include the names of some senior political figures and diplomats from Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out.\"\\nHe told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them.\\n\"One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round,\" he told us. \"His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone. They\\'re terrified of going to hospital to have it removed.\"\\nIran\\'s regime has treated these protests as an existential threat. Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed.\\nBut several people here told us that demonstrations had continued, at least into this week. The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere.\\n\"Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran,\" he said. \"My friends were there.

The regional proxy groups they once used as defences against attack have been weakened by Israel\\'s war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and by the fall of the former Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad.\\nAnd the Israeli-US war with Iran last year has depleted its military capabilities, and left it vulnerable to attack.\\nHidden behind this mountainous border, Iran\\'s regime is re-imposing its control.\\nBut hidden behind that repressive control is the growing fear of the Islamic Republic, unable to meet its people\\'s most basic demands: protection from foreign attacks, and prosperity at home.\\nAdditional reporting by Samantha Granville and Maad Mohammed\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Israel has moved the blocks which are supposed to mark its post-ceasefire line of control deeper into Gaza in several places, sowing confusion among Palestinians.\\nSatellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that in at least three areas Israel placed blocks, before returning later and moving the positions further into the Strip.\\nUnder the terms of the US-brokered deal with Hamas, Israel agreed to withdraw troops beyond a line marked in yellow on Israeli military maps, which it has illustrated on the ground with concrete yellow blocks.\\nDefence Minister Israel Katz warned in October that anyone crossing the Yellow Line would be \"met with fire\".\\nSince these comments were made, there have been a series of deadly incidents around the line.\\nIn Beit Lahia, Jabalia and al-Tuffah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) placed blocks and later returned to move them deeper inside Gaza. In total, 16 positions were moved.\\nIn the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, satellite images show that IDF troops moved at least seven already placed blocks between 27 November and 25 December.\\nThe position of the markers were moved on average 295m (968ft) deeper inside the Strip.\\nAs well as the blocks that have been moved, BBC Verify mapped 205 other markers. More than half of those have been placed significantly deeper inside the Strip than the line marked on maps.\\nAn IDF spokesperson said it rejected \"all claims that the Yellow Line has been moved or its crossing by IDF troops\".\\n\"The IDF is operating to visually mark the Yellow Line in accordance with the conditions on the ground and the ongoing operational situational assessment,\" they added.\\nAnalysis of satellite images up to 11 January suggests some sections of the Yellow Line - which the head of Israel\\'s military described as a \"new border line\" - also remain unmarked on the ground more than three months since the ceasefire began.\\nThe latest satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that blocks have not been placed along roughly 10km (six miles) of territory - leaving some people in Gaza struggling to know where the beginning of what the IDF calls a \"dangerous combat zone\" is.\\nLast month, one 23-year-old man near Khan Younis - whom the BBC is not naming for his own safety - said Israeli troops suddenly moved blocks near him beyond the mapped line, leaving him \"trapped\".\\n\"We are now living inside the Yellow Line, [but] behind the yellow blocks, with no idea what our fate will be,\" he said. \"The atmosphere at night is terrifying. We hear shells exploding, soldiers advancing, gunfire, and drones buzzing overhead without pause. We are also being shot at directly.\"\\nProf Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King\\'s College London, has called the movement of the blocks a \"tool for territorial engineering\".\\n\"By keeping the legal line on the map and the physical blocks hundreds of metres apart, Israel preserves the ability to shift where Gazans may live, move and farm without ever formally announcing a change of border,\" he said.\\nBut Efraim Inbar - president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security - suggested that the mapped line may not account for natural barriers to the markers and that IDF engineers may be putting the blocks where they \"find it easier to place\".\\nSince Katz\\'s warning in October, troops have shot at people crossing the Yellow Line on at least 69 occasions, an analysis of IDF Telegram posts and statements to the BBC showed.\\nOn 19 December, the IDF conducted a strike on a school sheltering displaced people in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City - some 330m inside the Palestinian side of the line, according to the IDF maps - but just metres from a yellow block that was moved there.\\nEyewitnesses said it happened while a wedding was taking place right by the school building. Five people, including children, were killed in the blast, Gaza\\'s Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said.\\nAn IDF statement relating to that day said they fired at \"suspicious individuals\" west of the Yellow Line, adding that the incident remained under review and that it \"regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals\".\\nIn another deadly incident, 17-year-old Zaher Nasser Shamiya was killed near yellow blocks in Jabalia camp in northern Gaza. His father said IDF troops fired at him before running him over with a tank on 10 December.\\n\"The tank turned his body into pieces… it came into the safe area [west of the Yellow Line] and ran over him,\" he said. BBC Verify has approached the IDF for comment on the incident.\\nAnd in November, local media reported that two children - aged eight and 10 or 11 - were killed by Israeli forces. Their uncle said that the pair had been gathering firewood for their disabled father when they were killed.\\nAddressing the deaths, an IDF statement said it had eliminated two suspects who crossed the Yellow Line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached IDF troops. It did not offer details on how the pair were identified as suspects.\\nAn IDF spokesperson accused Hamas fighters of firing on troops six times \"beyond the Yellow Line\" over the past week, in a statement to BBC Verify.\\nWhile Israel agreed to withdraw its forces behind the Yellow Line under October\\'s ceasefire deal, videos and satellite images seen by BBC Verify have repeatedly shown IDF vehicles operating beyond the mapped Yellow Line.\\nIn verified clips, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen 400m past the mapped Yellow Line at the Bani Suhaila roundabout in Khan Younis, while a satellite image taken on 25 December appeared to show a tank, excavator and other IDF vehicles positioned about 260m beyond the Yellow Line in Beit Lahia.\\nIn some cases, the movements of blocks were followed by demolitions of nearby buildings by the IDF.\\nIn the eastern part of Gaza City, satellite images show that hundreds of buildings were levelled up to and even beyond the first position of the blocks, then the markers were moved and there was further destruction\\nIn the nearby area of Jabalia, Israeli troops demolished a series of school buildings that were around 150m inside the mapped line.\\nIn some instances where IDF demolitions have occurred, the debris has effectively hidden the markers from Palestinians on the ground.\\nAn IDF spokesperson said that troops were dismantling Hamas\\' tunnel network that it said runs under buildings on both sides of the Yellow Line, adding that the tunnels\\' destruction \"may cause the collapse of buildings on both sides of the line\".\\nOn Wednesday, the US said the second phase of the ceasefire deal is due to begin, under which Israel is expected to withdraw from additional parts of the Strip. But there was no mention of a timeline for the withdrawal, which is linked to the \"demilitarisation\" of Hamas under October\\'s ceasefire deal.\\nIn parts of the Strip, the markers have been placed shortly before work began on the construction of temporary Israeli fortifications such as roadblocks and defensive barriers beyond the mapped Yellow Line.\\nKrieg told BBC Verify that the movement of the blocks would eventually allow Israel to turn parts of Gaza into a \"sterilised belt\".\\n\"In practice, that means the status of land is less about what the ceasefire map says and more about where concrete blocks sit on a given day,\" he said.\\nAdditional reporting by Maha El Gaml.\\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\\n'},\n",

Days later, authorities informed his family his execution had been scheduled for Wednesday without giving any additional details, according to Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw.\\nIn an update on Wednesday evening, Hengaw said it had \"serious and ongoing concerns regarding Soltani\\'s right to life\" but that, according to information obtained through relatives, his execution was postponed.\\nOn Thursday, Iran\\'s judiciary denied reports the 26-year-old was sentenced to death. Instead, the judiciary said Soltani faced security-related charges carrying prison terms only.\\nThe internet blackout imposed by the government has also made obtaining information on his status - and others in potentially similar situations - difficult.\\nAwyar Shekhi of Hengaw told the BBC on Wednesday she feared there were \"many\" cases like Soltani\\'s, highlighting the scale and speed to which Iranian authorities were carrying out violent crackdowns compared to previous protests.\\nOn Tuesday, one of Soltani\\'s relatives told BBC Persian that a court had issued a death sentence \"in an extremely rapid process, within just two days\".\\nSoltani is a resident of Fardis, Karaj, where he owns a clothes shop. He was arrested \"at his private residence\", Hengaw said in a statement.\\nIranian authorities had reportedly failed to give Soltani\\'s family any more information about his case, citing only that he had been arrested in connection with a protest.\\nHis sister, who is a lawyer, had tried to pursue the case but authorities told her there was nothing to pursue, Shekhi told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme.\\n\"He is just someone who is against the current situation in Iran... now he\\'s received a death sentence for expressing his opinion.\"\\nShekhi said prisoners on death row in Iran were typically granted a final visit by their loved ones before their execution.\\nWhile the Iranian authorities had told the family they would allow a meeting with Soltani before his execution, he had not been allowed any contact with his family since his arrest, she added.\\nThere was a \"high chance\" other people in Iran were in a similar position to Soltani, but there was little information about them because of the internet shutdown, according to Shekhi.\\nPresident Donald Trump has said the US will take \"very strong action\" against Iran if it executes protesters - telling Iranians to \"KEEP PROTESTING\" in a post on his Truth Social platform. He also said he has cancelled all meetings with Iranian officials \"until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY\".\\nHe has since said that his administration had been told \"on good authority\" that \"the killing in Iran is stopping, and there\\'s no plan for executions\".\\nThe BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.\\nThe US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,417 protesters, as well as 12 children and 10 uninvolved civilians, despite the blackout. Nearly 150 people affiliated with the security forces or government had also been killed, the group said.\\nAt least 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, according to HRANA.\\nIran\\'s judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei has pledged swift legal action against what he called \"rioters\". According to Mohseni-Ejei, those who have \"committed terrorist acts should definitely be given priority for trial and punishment\".\\nAuthorities were also planning to hold open trials for some of the main figures involved in recent unrest, with proceedings accessible to the media, he said on Wednesday.\\nBut Iran\\'s handling of Soltani\\'s case \"constitutes a clear violation of international human rights law\", Hengaw\\'s statement said, adding: \"The rushed and non-transparent handling of this case has heightened concerns over the use of the death penalty as a tool to suppress public protests.\"\\n\"Erfan is the first protester to be sentenced to death, but he won\\'t be the last,\" the US State Department said on its Farsi-language X account.\\nThe protests, which have reportedly spread to more than 180 cities and towns in all 31 provinces, were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living.\\nThey quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\\nAt least 12 men have been executed in Iran over the past three years after being sentenced to death in connection with the 2022 \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" protests.\\nThat nationwide unrest was triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was accused by morality police of wearing \"improper\" hijab.\\nHuman rights groups say the last such execution happened on 6 September, when Mehran Bahramian was hanged in Isfahan.\\nThe Norway-based group, Iran Human Rights, reported at the time that the authorities had tortured Bahramian to obtain confessions and that he did not receive a fair trial.\\nHe was sentenced to death by a court in January 2024 on the charge of \"enmity against God\" for allegedly killing a member of the Revolutionary Guards at a protest in Semirom in December 2022, it said.\\n'},\n",

Maryam had been fatally shot - and they had no idea where the bullet had come from.\\nReza carried Maryam\\'s body for an hour and a half. Exhausted, he sat down in an alley. After a short time, the door of a nearby house opened. The people who lived there took them into their garage, brought a white sheet and wrapped Maryam\\'s body in it.\\nDays before Maryam headed out to the protests, she had told her children - aged seven and 14 – about what was happening in their country. \"Sometimes parents go to the protests and don\\'t come back,\" she said. \"My blood, and yours, is no more precious than anyone else\\'s.\"\\nReza and Maryam\\'s names have been changed for safety reasons.\\nMaryam is one of thousands of protesters who should have returned home but never did, as the authorities responded to the rapid spread of demonstrations across Iran with a deadly crackdown.\\nThe US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has been able to confirm the killing of at least 2,400 protesters, including 12 children, during the past three weeks.\\nIt is extremely difficult to determine the death toll, which is expected to rise in the coming days, because the country remains under a near-total internet blackout imposed by Iranian authorities on Thursday night.\\nHuman-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is unable to report on the ground.\\nIranian authorities have not provided a death toll but local media have reported 100 security personnel have been killed, and protesters - whom they have portrayed as \"rioters and terrorists\" - have set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities.\\nDemonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran\\'s clerical rulers.\\nSecurity forces soon launched a violent crackdown, with at least 34 protesters reported killed by 7 January, the 11th day of the unrest. However, it appears the bloodiest crackdown was last Thursday and Friday, when thousands of people took to the streets across the country and called for an end to the rule of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\\nBBC Persian has received dozens of accounts from inside Iran. Defiant despite potential repercussions, the witnesses said they wanted to ensure the rest of the world knew of the violence against the protesters.\\n\"Our neighbourhood smells of blood - they killed so many,\" one told BBC Persian. Another recalled security forces \"mostly shooting at heads and faces\".\\nThe protests have spread across all 31 provinces. And the information trickling in clearly shows the scale of the killings in smaller cities and towns is just as severe as in major cities.\\nIn Tonekabon, a town of 50,000 people in the north, Sorena Golgun was killed on Friday. The 18-year-old university student was \"shot in the heart\" running from an ambush by security forces, according to a family member.\\nLike Sorena, many of the other protesters killed were young and full of dreams. Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion-design student who hoped to study in Milan, was shot dead in Tehran on Thursday.\\nHer mother spent about six hours travelling from their home, in the western city of Kermanshah, to collect Robina\\'s body from Tehran. On her way back, she held her beloved daughter in her arms. But when she arrived, the security forces made her bury the body in a remote cemetery outside the city - with no other family or friends present.\\nNot all those killed were protesters. Navid Salehi, a 24-year-old nurse in Kermanshah, was shot multiple times leaving work on Thursday.\\nThe bodies of many protesters were sent to the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre, in Tehran.\\nThe scenes there were so distressing Sahanand, who did not want to give his real name, decided to travel almost 1,000km to a border area so he could send out video footage by using the mobile data networks of neighbouring countries. On Saturday, Sahanand had seen more than 2,000 bodies lying on the ground, he said.\\nAgain, the BBC has no means to confirm this. However, in two newly emerged videos from Kahrizak, BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in one piece of footage and at least 178 bodies in the other. The two videos probably show some of the same bodies, so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.\\nOne young woman, speaking to BBC Persian on condition of anonymity, described last week\\'s events as like \"a war\". The protesters remained \"more united than ever before\" but it was too much for her and this week she had fled the country - like many, gripped by fear the authorities will start a new wave of executions and prosecutions.\\n\"I\\'m really afraid of what might happen to those who are still in Iran,\" she added.\\nAdditional reporting by Farzad Seifikaran and Hasan Solhjou\\n'},\n",

The director of an organisation that helps Iranians get online also told BBC Persian that Starlink had been made free.\\nThe satellite technology, which belongs to Elon Musk\\'s SpaceX company, provides internet to tens of thousands of people in Iran, despite the fact it is illegal there. Since the internet was shut down, it has become one of the last, if not the last, remaining channels for Iranians to communicate with the outside world.\\nThe BBC has approached SpaceX to confirm it has waived the fee, but they are yet to respond.\\nUsing the service in Iran carries a punishment of up to two years in prison and authorities have reportedly been searching for Starlink dishes to stop people from connecting to the internet.\\n\"They\\'re going onto rooftops and checking the surrounding buildings,\" says Parsa - not his real name - who spoke to BBC Persian using a Starlink connection.\\n\"What people need to know is that the government is searching areas where a lot of footage has come out, so they need to be even more cautious,\" he says.\\nThe device operates like a mobile phone mast in space, using a constellation of satellites to communicate with small dishes on the ground with a built-in WiFi router.\\nBut the device is costly and beyond the means of many in Iran - so making it free may lead to its wider use.\\nWhy are there protests in Iran and what has Trump said about US action?\\nBowen: Authoritarian regimes die gradually then suddenly, but Iran is not there yet\\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera TV on Monday, Iran\\'s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet had been cut off \"after we confronted terrorist operations and realised orders were coming from outside the country\".\\nIran\\'s Fars news agency, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), claimed internet restrictions were imposed to stop foreign social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram being used \"to organise violence and unrest.\"\\nHuman rights groups have condemned the blanket blackout as an abuse of power and a spokesperson for the UN\\'s Human rights office told the BBC the shutdown \"impacts the works of those documenting human rights violations.\"\\nSo far, one human rights group has confirmed the killing of more than 2,400 protesters during the unrest, as well as almost 150 people affiliated with security forces, although these numbers are believed to be much higher.\\nIt is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country.\\nThe internet shutdown has also made it hard to gather and verify evidence of what is happening on the ground.\\n\"I think a lot of people are connected, but only a very small number are taking the risk of sending information out,\" explains Parsa.\\nAccording to human rights organisation Witness, at least 50,000 people are using Starlink to access the internet.\\nMahsa Alimardani, who works as its associate director for technology, threats and opportunities, says the Iranian authorities have tried \"aggressively jamming\" Starlink to stop people accessing the internet but it has not been successful. \"That\\'s why they are resorting to physical confiscations,\" she adds.\\nBut those who are taking the risk are going to great lengths. One man who spoke to BBC Persian said he travelled almost 1,000km (620 miles) to a border area so he could use mobile networks of neighbouring countries to send video he recorded.\\nThe scene he witnessed - of a huge number of bodies lying on the ground at a forensic medical centre in Tehran - was so distressing that he felt compelled to share it, he told the BBC.\\nThe Iranian government has a long track record of spying on its citizens, including digitally, to tighten its grip on society.\\nPhishing techniques have reportedly been used to hack phones and access people\\'s data and Iran\\'s access to the internet is largely restricted to a domestic service that mimics a private intranet.\\nAccess to foreign social media platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram is blocked, meaning Iranians have to use virtual private networks (VPNs) in order to access them.\\nBut despite this, Instagram is one of the most popular platforms in Iran, with an estimated 50 million users.\\nThough some news is being shared online, experts say the Iranian government aims to control the narrative by limiting what information gets out.\\nAna Diamond, research associate at the Oxford Disinformation and Extremism Lab, says the government is weaponising information by carefully curating it.\\n\"Such material is designed less to inform than to condition; to almost normalise casualties, especially as the Iranian government calls them rioters, eroding collective resistance, and preparing the public - both inside and outside of Iran - for escalations of violence that may be yet to come if the protests continue,\" Diamond says.\\nDespite the dangers, Starlink has become indispensable for many Iranians communicating what is happening inside the country to the rest of the world.\\n\"I\\'d rather not think about it [getting caught]. It can be very frightening,\" Parsa says.\\nOn Tuesday, Iranian intelligence forces said they had seized a large consignment of Starlink kits allegedly intended for \"espionage and sabotage operations\" inside the country.\\nHowever, BBC Persian has confirmed through multiple sources in Iran that the kits are used by many people wanting to communicate without censorship.\\nParsa cautions that getting caught using the device is not the only danger.\\nIf Iranians want to send videos that are shared or intercepted online, he says, \"they need to understand that if they record them from home or from the place where the device is kept, their risk increases, and the government can identify the location\".\\nAdditional reporting by Hadi Nili, BBC Tech correspondent\\n'},\n",

The near total internet blackout imposed by the government since last week has left more than 90 million Iranians almost completely cut off from the outside world.\\nThe number of people who have been killed in the protests is not fully known. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) places the estimate at more than 2,500. An Iranian official previously told Reuters 2,000 people have been killed but claimed \"terrorists\" were to blame.\\nBBC Verify and BBC Persian have previously reported on images emerging from this mortuary but we are not showing these new videos because the images are too graphic.\\nThe footage was posted on Tuesday by Vahid, a US-based Iranian social media influencer and activist, who said they were filmed on 10 January inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in south Tehran.\\nVahid said the videos were filmed by a man who had travelled nearly 1,000km to find internet access. The man told BBC Persian he used mobile networks from neighbouring countries to upload the footage. Vahid has been posting dozens of videos documenting events inside the country for the outside world to see.\\nTwo of the videos show rows of body bags on the floor as the man walks up and down a road that runs through the northern section of the vast mortuary complex. He later moves through a courtyard and inside a large warehouse, and walks in and out of adjacent rooms filled with more body bags. At one point he is heard describing the scene as \"the apocalypse\".\\nThe man filming is heard saying, \"Today is Saturday, a day after the call\". He is referring to the call made by Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah, for nationwide protests that took place last Thursday and Friday night.\\nTwo more clips contain a collection of photos taken from the mortuary showing several bodies wrapped in the zip-up bags, including one which appears burnt.\\nBBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in the five-minute video and at least 178 bodies in the 16-minute clip. The two videos likely show some of the same bodies so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.\\nThe videos contain at least nine separate clips edited together. The positions of shadows in the footage indicate these sections were likely filmed at different times throughout the day. We have matched identifiable features from the complex, including separate buildings, the red roof of a warehouse and fences with satellite images on Google.\\nThe man films as he moves around inside the centre, where more bodies are kept on stretchers as well as the floor. The footage shows some body bags fully zipped up while others are either half or entirely unzipped, revealing victims\\' faces and injuries. Some are completely uncovered. We can see blood-soaked towels and sheets scattered around the complex with streaks of blood on the floor.\\nA number of the bodies have visible wounds. Two bodies appear to be soaked in blood, and another is seen with a deep stomach wound.\\nSome body bags have papers attached to them or details written on the body bags in a white marker such as a name, national ID number, date of birth and death, and in some cases their father\\'s name. At least two men are described as unidentified on a sheet of paper attached to their bag, and at least one woman and one teenager are among the victims.\\nThe date of death on three of the male victims\\' body bags states 9 January. Another body bag shows a date of birth using the Iranian calendar. It says 1/1/1388, which corresponds to 21/3/2009, indicating that it belongs to a 16-year-old.\\nDuring one moment in the 16-minute clip the man points his phone at a building to his right and a voice can be heard saying: \"There are many [bodies] inside. It\\'s not possible to go inside… this is the women\\'s area\". Iranian mortuaries separate the bodies of men and women for religious reasons.\\nAt a different point we can see a body bag at the back of a hearse and a man nearby is heard telling a female official that it is his sister.\\nSeveral ambulances, hearses and vans are filmed around the grounds. Officials are seen inspecting the rows of bodies, taking swabs from the victims, and talking to potential loved ones.\\nIt is not clear why the bodies of those killed in anti-government protests may have been transferred to the centre, but eyewitness accounts provided to BBC Persian suggest hospitals have been overwhelmed with the number of casualties in the protests.\\nHRANA, which has been tracking the death toll since the unrest began, has reported that 2,403 protesters, 147 people affiliated with the government, nine civilians and 12 children have been killed so far.\\nCrowds of people, many who appear to be family members and friends, are seen walking in and out of the complex as they try to identify the bodies. Cries and wails are repeatedly heard throughout the videos as people mourn the loss of their loves ones.\\n\"Some of our best people have been killed,\" the man filming is heard saying.\\nIranian state TV has since reported that a \"substantial\" number of bodies had been taken to the mortuary. It claimed the majority of the victims were members of Iran\\'s security forces or passers-by who had nothing to do with the demonstrations.\\nMost international news organisation, including the BBC, are restricted from operating inside the country so we have to rely on verifying footage on social media.\\nAdditional reporting by Roja Assadi, Richard Irvine-Brown and Kumar Malhotra\\n'},\n",

The currency, the rial, reached a record low in December.\\nWhile the Iranian regime is under huge pressure, the evidence is that it's not about to die.\\nCrucially, the security forces remain loyal. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979 the Iranian authorities have spent time and money creating an elaborate and ruthless network of coercion and repression.\\nIn the last two weeks, the regime's forces obeyed orders to shoot their fellow citizens in the streets. The result is that the demonstrations of the last few weeks have ended - as far as we can tell in a country whose rulers continue to impose a communications black out.\\nAt the forefront of the suppression of protest is the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the most important single organisation in the country.\\nIt has the specific task of defending the ideology and system of government of the Islamic revolution of 1979, answering directly to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The IRGC is estimated to have something like 150,000 men under arms, operating as a parallel force to Iran's conventional armed military. It is also a major player in the Iranian economy.\\nA potent mix of power, money, corruption and ideology means it has every reason to defend the system.\\nThe IRGC has an auxiliary force, the Basij militia, a volunteer paramilitary organisation. It claims to have millions of members. Some western estimates put its active duty contingent in the hundreds of thousands, still a very substantial total. The Basij are at the sharp end of the regime's crackdowns against protesters.\\nI saw the IRGC and the Basij in action in Tehran in 2009, as they moved to suppress huge demonstrations that followed a disputed presidential election. Basij volunteers lined the streets armed with rubber truncheons and wooden clubs.\\nBehind them were uniformed men with automatic weapons. Motorcycle squads roared around Tehran's broad avenues, descending on groups trying to protest. In less than two weeks, protests that had choked the streets were reduced to small groups of students chanting slogans and setting fire to rubbish skips.\\nAt dusk, people went to their balconies and rooftops to chant God is greatest, as their parents had against the Shah, until that petered out too.\\nThe seeming resilience of the internal security forces does not mean that the supreme leader or his lieutenants can or will relax. US President Donald Trump is still threatening to take action. The millions of Iranians who want the fall of the regime must be seething with resentment and anger.\\nIn Tehran, the government and the supreme leader appear to be looking for ways to release some of the pressure they are facing. Bellicose official rhetoric is mixed with an offer to resume negotiations with the US.\\nIt is hard to see how the two sides can make a deal over Iran's nuclear plans and ballistic missile programme that have defeated earlier rounds of talks. But negotiations could buy time for Iran, especially if Trump can be convinced that a deal, however unlikely, is possible.\\nAs part of his pressure campaign, Trump says that he will slap a 25% tariff on the goods of any country that does business with Iran. Again, it is hard to see how that might work. China buys most of Iran's oil.\\nTrump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed a truce in their trade war last autumn, with a summit due to be held in Beijing in April. The summit will deal with the biggest issues facing the world's two superpowers. Would Trump want to jeopardise or disrupt the summit simply to keep up pressure on Iran?\\nIn Tehran the biggest priority for the ageing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is to preserve the Islamic Republic's system of rule. More eruptions of protest can expect a severe response.\\nAn advantage for the regime is lack of coherent leadership among protesters. The eldest son of the Shah deposed by the revolution almost half a century ago has been trying to be the leader they lack. His appeal seems to be limited by his family's history and his close links with Israel.\\nOne lesson that might worry the clerics and military men in Tehran comes from their erstwhile ally, former President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. He seemed to have won his war, and was being slowly rehabilitated by Saudi Arabia and the Arab League when he was faced at the end of 2024 with a well organised rebel offensive.\\nBoth Russia and Iran, his two most important allies were neither willing or perhaps able to save him. Within days, Assad and his family were flying into exile in Moscow.\\nAn authoritarian regime decays gradually, then suddenly. When Assad's Syria collapsed, it went very fast. Another example that might be studied in Tehran is the downfall in 2011 of President Ben Ali of Tunisia, when the army moved to protect protesters from the internal security forces.\\nThe fall of Ben Ali precipitated the resignation of Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He might have survived huge demonstrations had not the armed forces decided that to save their own position he had to go.\\nCould that happen in Iran? Perhaps. Not yet.\\nOpponents of the Islamic regime will hope for more pressure at home and abroad and the emergence of credible leadership, so that the process of decay will speed up, accelerating from gradual, to sudden.\\n\"},\n",

As a result, Iranians have been almost completely cut off from the outside world.\\nThe country restricts international news organisations from operating there, hampering efforts to independently verify the number of people who have died during the protests.\\nIranian authorities have accused foreign government of fomenting the unrest and have condemned \"terrorist actions\", state media reported.\\nBut Cooper said Iran\\'s leaders were \"peddling its manufactured narrative of foreign manipulation\".\\nShe added: \"The United Kingdom condemns in the strongest of terms the horrendous and brutal killing of Iranian protesters, and we demand that the Iranian authorities respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of their citizens.\"\\nCooper also said British officials were in contact with Iranian counterparts about UK nationals detained there.\\nShe confirmed a Foreign Office minister had met the family of Craig and Lindsay Foreman on Monday, a couple who were arrested and accused of espionage in Iran last January while on a motorcycle trip around the world.\\nLast year, a major report by Parliament\\'s intelligence and security committee found the UK faces a \"rising\" and unpredictable threat from Iran, and raised particular concern over \"sharp increase\" in physical threats against opponents of Iran\\'s regime in the UK.\\nAt the time, the Iranian embassy in London \"wholly rejected\" the report\\'s findings.\\nIn October, the UK, France and Germany activated a so-called \"snapback\" mechanism to reintroduce sweeping UN economic and military sanctions on Iran for failing to comply with restrictions on its nuclear industry.\\nCooper said the government had imposed over 220 sanctions on Iran since Labour came to power.\\nBut shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel called for more information about what new sanctions would be put in place, and asked why the Iranian ambassador was not summoned sooner.\\n'},\n",

Breaking the wall of silence between Iran and the rest of the world takes immense courage, given the risk of reprisals by the authorities.\\nOmid, in his early 40s and whose name we have changed for his safety, has been protesting on the streets of a small city in southern Iran over the past few days against worsening economic hardship.\\nHe said security forces had opened fire at unarmed protesters in his city with Kalashnikov-style assault rifles.\\n\"We are fighting a brutal regime with empty hands,\" he said.\\nThe BBC has received similar accounts of the crackdown by security forces following the widespread protests across the country last week.\\nSince then, internet access has been cut by the authorities, making reporting from Iran more difficult than ever. BBC Persian is banned from reporting inside Iran by the government.\\nOne of the largest nationwide anti-government protests took place on Thursday, the twelfth night of demonstrations. Many people appear to have joined the protests on Thursday and Friday after calls from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution.\\nThe following day, Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said: \"The Islamic Republic will not back down.\" It appears that the worst bloodshed occurred after that warning as security forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps take their orders from him.\\nIranian authorities accused the US and Israel of fomenting trouble and condemned \"terrorist actions\", state media reported.\\nA young woman from Tehran said last Thursday felt like \"the day of judgement\".\\n\"Even remote neighbourhoods of Tehran were packed with protesters - places you wouldn\\'t believe,\" she said.\\n\"But on Friday, security forces only killed and killed and killed.

Here, people only chant and get killed. It is a one-sided war.\"\\nEyewitnesses in Fardis, a city just to the west of Tehran, said that on Friday, members of the paramilitary Basij force under the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) suddenly attacked protesters after hours without a police presence on the streets.\\nThe forces, who were in uniform and riding motorcycles, fired live ammunition directly at protesters, according to the witnesses. Unmarked cars were also driven into alleys, with occupants shooting at residents who were not involved in the protests, they said.\\n\"Two or three people were killed in every alley,\" one witness alleged.\\nThose who have given accounts to BBC Persian say the reality inside Iran is hard for the outside world to imagine, and the death toll reported by international media so far only represents a fraction of their own estimates.\\nInternational news outlets are not allowed to work freely inside Iran and they are mostly relying on Iranian human rights groups who are active outside the country. On Monday the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 648 protesters in Iran had been killed, including nine people under the age of 18.\\nSome local sources and eyewitnesses report very high numbers of people killed across different cities, ranging from several hundreds to thousands.\\nThe BBC is currently unable to independently verify these figures and, so far, Iranian authorities have not provided official or transparent statistics on the number of deaths of protesters.\\nHowever, Iranian media has reported that 100 security personnel had been killed during the protests, saying that protesters - whom they refer to as \"rioters\" - set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities.\\nVideos verified by BBC Persian\\'s fact-checking team also show police vehicles and some government buildings being set alight in different locations during the protests.\\nTestimonies and video sent to BBC Persian are mainly from larger cities such as Tehran, nearby Karaj, Rasht in the north, Mashhad in the north-east, and Shiraz in the south. These areas have greater access to the internet via the Starlink satellite network.\\nInformation from small towns - where many early casualties occurred - is scarce as their access to Starlink is very limited.\\nBut the volume, consistency, and similarity of the accounts received from various cities point to the severity of the crackdown and the widespread use of lethal violence.\\nNurses and medics who spoke to the BBC said they had seen numerous dead bodies and injured protesters.\\nThey reported that hospitals in many cities had been overwhelmed and were unable to treat those with severe injuries, especially to the head and eyes. Some witnesses reported bodies \"stacked on top of each other\" and not handed over to families.\\nGraphic videos published on the activist-run Telegram channel Vahid Online on Sunday showed a large number of bodies at the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in Tehran, with many families either mourning or attempting to identify the corpses.\\nIn one of the videos apparently from Kahrizak, relatives are seen looking at the photos of unidentified bodies displayed on a screen.\\nMany bodies in black bags were visible in the facility and on the street outside, only some of which seem to have been identified.\\nOne video showed the inside of a warehouse containing several bodies, while another showed a truck being unloaded with people removing corpses from it.\\nA mortuary worker in a cemetery in Mashhad said that before sunrise on Friday morning between 180 and 200 bodies with severe head injuries were brought in and buried immediately.\\nA source in Rasht told BBC Persian that 70 bodies of protesters were transferred to a hospital mortuary in the city on Thursday. According to the source, security forces demanded \"payment for bullets\" before releasing bodies to families.\\nAt the same time, a medical staff member at a hospital in eastern Tehran told BBC Persian that on Thursday, around 40 bodies were brought there the same day. The hospital\\'s name has been withheld to protect the identity of the medic.\\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Sunday that he was \"shocked by reports of violence and excessive use of force by the Iranian authorities against protesters resulting in deaths and injuries in recent days\".\\n\"I want to emphasise that regardless of the death toll, the use of lethal force by security forces is concerning,\" Mai Sato, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, told BBC Persian.\\nWhat questions do you have about Trump\\'s first year since returning as President?

Many of them didn\\'t even make it to the hospital.\\n\"The number was so large that there wasn\\'t enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another.\\n\"After the morgue became full, they stacked them on top of one another in the prayer room,\" she said.\\nThe hospital worker said the dead or wounded were young people.\\n\"Couldn\\'t look at many of them, they were 20-25 years old.\"\\nA doctor who contacted the BBC via a Starlink satellite connection on Friday night said Tehran\\'s main eye specialist centre, Farabi Hospital, had gone into crisis mode with emergency services overwhelmed.\\nNon-urgent admissions and surgeries were suspended and staff called in to deal with emergency cases, he said.\\nIran\\'s security forces often use shotguns which fire cartridges filled with pellets during confrontations with protesters.\\nAnother doctor from the city of Kashan in central Iran told the BBC many injured protesters had been hit in the eyes, and that his colleagues in hospitals across the city reported receiving many wounded people during Friday night\\'s unrest.\\nThursday night produced similar accounts.\\nA doctor at a medical centre in Tehran told the BBC: \"The number of injured people and fatalities was very high. I saw one person who had been shot in the eye, with the bullet exiting from the back of his head.\\n\"Around midnight, the centre\\'s doors were closed. A group of people broke the door and threw a man who had been shot inside, then left. But it was too late - he had died before reaching hospital and could not be saved.\"\\nThe BBC also obtained a video and audio message from a medic at a hospital in the south-west city of Shiraz on Thursday, who said large numbers of injured were being brought in, and the hospital did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx.\\nWhat footage is emerging from Iran shows protesters in Tehran taking to the streets en masse on Friday night, burning vehicles, and a government building set alight in Karaj, near the capital.\\nThe Iranian army has since said it will join security forces in defending public property.\\nIt follows reports that Iranian security forces were spread thin as the unrest extended throughout the country.\\nIranian authorities issued a series of co-ordinated warnings to protesters on Friday, with the National Security Council saying \"decisive\" legal action would be taken against \"armed vandals\".\\nIranian police maintained that no one was killed in Tehran on Friday night, though they said 26 buildings were set on fire, causing extensive damage.\\nAn eyewitness who joined the protests on Thursday and Friday nights in Tehran told BBC Persian Television that Gen Z Iranians have been instrumental in encouraging their parents and older people to come out and join the protest marches, urging them not to be afraid.\\nEU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday that Europe backed Iranians\\' mass protests and condemned the \"violent repression\" against demonstrators.\\nUN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said on Friday the international body was very disturbed by the loss of life.\\n\"People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,\" he said.\\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz released a joint statement on Friday calling on Iranian authorities to \"allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal\".\\nIran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday, saying: \"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this.\"\\nIn later remarks broadcast on state television, Khamenei reiterated that his regime \"will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements\" who he said were \"trying to please the president of the US\".\\nMeanwhile, the son of Iran\\'s last shah, who was deposed by an Islamic revolution in 1979, described the protests as \"magnificent\" and urged Iranians to continue over the weekend.\\n\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres,\" Reza Pahlavi said in a social media video.\\nUS-based Pahlavi also said he was preparing to return to the country.\\nBut former UK ambassador to Iran Sir Simon Gass told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that \"we really shouldn\\'t get too ahead of ourselves\" when discussing regime change.\\nHe said the lack of organised opposition within Iran meant people did not have an alternative figure to coalesce around as things stood.\\nHowever, he noted the protests were \"a much wider movement\" than previous flare-ups, which were triggered by Iranians finding it \"almost impossible to make ends meet because of the disaster to the economy\".\\nOn Friday, President Trump reiterated his threat to Iran\\'s leadership that the US would \"hit them very hard\" if they \"start killing people\".\\nHe clarified that this did not mean \"boots on the ground\". Last year, the US conducted air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.\\nMeanwhile, the US state department said accusations by Iran\\'s foreign minister that Washington and Israel were fuelling the protests were a \"delusional attempt to deflect\" attention from the challenges the regime was facing.\\nTaghi Rahmani, an Iranian political activist who spent 14 years in prison and whose wife, Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, was re-arrested in December, said any lasting change must come from Iranians instead of foreign intervention.\\nThe protests have been the most widespread since a 2022 uprising sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups.\\nAdditional reporting by Soroush Negahdari, Mallory Moench and Aleks Phillips\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called anti-government protesters \"troublemakers\" who are trying \"to please the president of the US\".\\nIran also sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council blaming the US for turning the protests into what it called \"violent subversive acts and widespread vandalism\" in Iran. Trump, meanwhile, said Iran was \"in big trouble\".\\nThe protests, in their 13th day, erupted over the economy and have grown into the largest in years - leading to calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and some urging the restoration of the monarchy.\\nAt least 48 protesters and 14 security personnel have been killed, according to human rights groups.\\nAn internet blackout is in place.\\n\"We will be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday, adding that his administration was watching the situation in Iran carefully and that any US involvement does not mean \"boots on the ground\".\\n\"It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,\" he said.\\nThese remarks echo ones the US president made about the Iranian government on Thursday, where he pledged to \"hit them very hard\" if they \"start killing people\".\\nKhamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday.\\n\"Let everyone know that the Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this,\" the 86-year-old said.\\nLater, in remarks made to a gathering of supporters and broadcast on state television, Khamenei doubled down, saying Iran \"will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements\".\\nIran\\'s United Nations ambassador accused the US of \"interfering in Iran\\'s internal affairs through threats, incitement, and the deliberate encouragement of instability and violence,\" in a letter to the Security Council.\\nSince protests began on 28 December, in addition to the 48 protesters killed, more than 2,277 individuals have also been arrested, the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) said.\\nThe Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, had been killed.\\nBBC Persian has spoken to the families of 22 of them and confirmed their identities. The BBC and most other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran.\\nIn a joint statement, the leaders of the UK, Germany and France said they were \"deeply concerned about reports of violence by Iranian security forces, and strongly condemn the killing of protesters\".\\n\"The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal,\" French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.\\nUN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the United Nations was very disturbed by the loss of life. \"People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,\" he said.\\nMeanwhile the Iranian security and judicial authorities issued a series of coordinated warnings, hardening their rhetoric and echoing an earlier message of \"no leniency\" by Iran\\'s top security body, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).\\nIran\\'s National Security Council - responsible for domestic security and not to be confused with the SNSC - said \"decisive and necessary legal action will be taken\" against protesters, which it described as \"armed vandals\" and \"disruptors of peace and security\".\\nIn a brief statement, it warned against \"any form of attack on military, law-enforcement, or governmental facilities\". The intelligence arm of Iran\\'s Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said it would not tolerate what it described as \"terrorist acts\", asserting that it would continue its operations \"until the complete defeat of the enemy\\'s plan\".\\nReza Pahlavi, the son of Iran\\'s last shah who was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution, called on Trump on Friday to \"be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran\".\\nPahlavi, who lives close to Washington DC, had urged protesters to take to the streets on Thursday and Friday.\\nProtests have taken place across the country, with BBC Verify verifying videos from 67 locations.\\nOn Friday, protesters amassed after weekly prayers in the south-eastern city of Zahedan, videos verified by BBC Persian and BBC Verify show. In one of the videos, people can be heard chanting \"death to the dictator\", referencing Khamenei.\\nIn another, protesters gather near a local mosque, when several loud bangs can be heard.\\nAnother verified video from Thursday showed a fire at the office of the Young Journalists Club, a subsidiary of state broadcaster Irib, in the city of Isfahan. It is unclear what caused the fire and if anyone was injured.\\nPhotos received by the BBC from Thursday night also show cars overturned and set alight at Tehran\\'s Kaaj roundabout.\\nThe country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, with minor amounts of traffic returning on Friday, internet monitoring groups Cloudfare and Netblocks said. That means less information is emerging from Iran.\\nIHRNGO director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said in a statement that \"the extent of the government\\'s use of force against protesters has been increasing, and the risk of intensified violence and the widespread killing of protesters after the internet shutdown is very serious\".\\nNobel laureate Shirin Ebadi has warned of a possible \"massacre\" during the internet shutdown.\\nOne person who was able to send a message to the BBC said he was in Shiraz, in southern Iran. He reported a run on supermarkets by residents trying to stock up on food and other essentials, expecting worse days to come.\\n\\nThe shutdown of the internet has meant that cash machines are not working, and there is no way to pay for purchases in shops where debit cards cannot be used due to the lack of internet.\\nMahsa Alimardani, who works for the human rights NGO Witness, told the BBC in London that she had not been able to make contact with her family since Thursday evening.\\n\"It\\'s very anxiety-inducing, not having access to information, not knowing if your loved ones participated [in the protests] or if they\\'re okay,\" she said.\\nThe protests began nearly two weeks ago with shopkeepers in Tehran angry about the collapsing currency, before spreading to students and street demonstrations.\\nThe last major protests were in 2022, when demonstrations erupted after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.\\nMore than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.\\nAdditional reporting by Reha Kansara, Kasra Naji and Soroush Negahdari\\n'},\n",

       "  'Article': 'Tehran has witnessed its largest anti-government demonstrations in decades, as protests swept through dozens of districts across the capital and its wider metropolitan area of nearly 16 million people.\\nFor several hours there on Thursday night, security forces appeared unusually restrained. In areas where crowds were especially large, police and security units largely avoided direct confrontation, raising questions about whether the authorities were deliberately holding back.\\nThat restraint, however, appears selective and strategic rather than absolute. While Tehran has seen a comparatively cautious approach, reports from smaller cities and provinces around the country tell a far more violent story.\\nAccording to multiple Iranian human rights organisations, including the Germany-based Kurdish Iranian human rights group Hengaw and US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (Hrana), more than 40 people have been killed since the protests began nearly two weeks ago.\\nBBC Persian\\'s verification team has confirmed the identities of at least 21 victims through interviews with relatives, many of whom were killed in Lorestan and Kurdish-majority regions of Illam and Kermanshah provinces. Video evidence obtained by the BBC shows security forces firing directly at protesters. At least four security forces have also been killed.\\nIran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has issued a firm warning, declaring that the Islamic Republic \"will not back down in the face of vandals\". In a speech on Friday addressing the unrest, he framed the protests as foreign-inspired sabotage.\\nReferring to property damage in Tehran, he said demonstrators had destroyed their own buildings \"just to please the president of the United States\".\\nFollowing the seizure by the US of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, many within Iran\\'s leadership are increasingly concerned that the United States may be serious about its threats, particularly after a 12-day war with Israel last June, during which the US bombed Iran\\'s nuclear sites, and the weakening of Iranian-backed militant groups across the region.\\nIt is possible these developments could embolden Washington to strike Iran without fear of significant retaliation.\\nPresident Donald Trump has loomed large over the regime\\'s calculations. Since almost the start of the protests, Trump has issued repeated warnings to Tehran, stating that the US would respond forcefully if peaceful protesters were killed.\\nIn a recent US radio interview, Trump said Iran would \"get hit very hard\" if it repeated the mass killings seen during previous uprisings. He downplayed responsibility for deaths so far by attributing some to \"stampedes\", but stressed that Iranian authorities had been \"told very strongly\" where the red lines lay.\\nIt is not clear whether these warnings may be behind the regime\\'s response. In Tehran, where symbolically the costs are greatest, security forces appear to be exercising restraint to avoid images of mass bloodshed. Gunshots were reportedly heard late Thursday night in Tehran, but due to the near blackout of the internet it is difficult to verify exactly what is happening in the city.\\nOutside the capital, however, repression has been swift and lethal.\\nDuring the mass protests in Iran in 2022 following the death of the Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran, more than 500 people were killed, human rights groups say. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with its affiliated militias and anti-riot police, played a pivotal role in violently suppressing those protests.\\nHistorically, the Islamic Republic has relied on a layered security apparatus to suppress mass protests. Alongside riot police, the regime deploys the Basij militia - a volunteer paramilitary force under IRGC control - often operating in plain clothes.\\nIn more intense situations, command shifts from police to IRGC commanders, signalling that unrest is being treated as a national security threat rather than a civil disturbance. This escalation typically precedes harsher crackdowns, including mass arrests and lethal force.\\nIran\\'s President Masoud Pezeshkian has called for tolerance of what he described as \"legitimate protests,\" but his authority is limited. Ultimate control over security policy rests with the supreme leader, not the presidency.\\nThe current approach suggests the regime is buying time, attempting to exhaust protesters, limit casualties in visible areas, and avoid crossing thresholds that could provoke direct foreign retaliation.\\n'}]"

       "      <td>Sometimes the power of Christmas will make you do wild and wonderful things. You do not need to believe in the Holy Trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. The simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. One congregation in Ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on Christmas Eve. The pastor at Grand Lake United Methodist Church in Celina, Ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of Jesus.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many religious people the message of Jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. The sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. Jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time – but what would a generous act look like in our times? That was the focus of the sermon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! After the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. A bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this Christmas Eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did they do with this offering? Members of the congregation drove down to the local Waffle House to visit the ladies working the night shift. What a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies working at Waffle House clearly were not with their families. They had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. The congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. They donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at Waffle House.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn total that amounted to $3,500 being split amongst the staff. What a beautiful moment! What a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! Doing a good deed like this on Christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at Waffle House. Sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. It was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. It speaks volumes about the merits of the Church in our daily lives. This simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.</td>\n",

       "      <td>When a rare shark was caught, scientists were left blundering for answers. This shark has a unique feature. And it’s not that it can survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time. This shark’s unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth. If you’ve ever seen the hit science fiction movie “Alien,” this shark is that monster made manifest on earth. This shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite. It’s a deadly predator of the deep sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides its telescoping teeth, this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in 1986. In the three decades since it was first found, just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut during a routine survey in the Donghe Township in Taiwan, the country’s Fisheries Research Institute found five of these horrifying deep-sea sharks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team was notably horrified and described “the most obvious feature are the needle-shaped teeth, like snake-like fangs. This is also the origin of viper shark name.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s right. This beast is called the viper shark. And as you can tell by its name, it is ferocious with its prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals, little is known about them. But researchers think these creatures swim between 300-400 meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to 150 meters below at night. Could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of 350 meters below the surface of the sea. Four were already dead. But a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater. But it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat. It perished just a day later.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile viper sharks look like the Alien monster from the movie, they do not feed on humans. Their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes. One of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish. These creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glow-in-the-dark bodies. And when they swim close enough, the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of Shikoku Island in Japan in 1986. Bottom-trawler vessel Seiryo-Maru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the fish was a new discovery at the time, it’s scientific name honors the Seiryo-Maru captain, Hiromichi Kabeya. The shark’s scientific name was Trigonognathus kabeyai.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough not much about these fish are known, scientists classify them in as a dogfish shark. They have only been found in the deep parts of the Pacific Ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow would you react if this shark came up on the other end of your fishing line? Would you think you were having a nightmare?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Donald Trump has the unnerving ability to ability to create his own reality and convince millions of Americans that what he says it is true. The problem with the president lying is that he then believes his own lies. A new poll shows how that can get the country into deep trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new ABC News/Washington Post poll came out after the president’s physician gave him a physical and mental exam. The doctor gave Trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis poll was able to capture Americans’ opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around Trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. In addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear Trump tell the public that he was a “very stable genius” before they were interviewed. He said:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ABC/Washington Post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. That left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, there was the question of Trump’s mental stability. The poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. When asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was taken from January 15 through 18, 2018. The random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both English and Spanish. The margin of error was +/- 3.5 percentage points.\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatured Image via Getty Images/Drew Angerer</td>\n",

       "0  Sometimes the power of Christmas will make you do wild and wonderful things. You do not need to believe in the Holy Trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. The simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. One congregation in Ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on Christmas Eve. The pastor at Grand Lake United Methodist Church in Celina, Ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of Jesus.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many religious people the message of Jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. The sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. Jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time – but what would a generous act look like in our times? That was the focus of the sermon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! After the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. A bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this Christmas Eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat did they do with this offering? Members of the congregation drove down to the local Waffle House to visit the ladies working the night shift. What a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ladies working at Waffle House clearly were not with their families. They had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. The congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. They donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at Waffle House.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn total that amounted to $3,500 being split amongst the staff. What a beautiful moment! What a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! Doing a good deed like this on Christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at Waffle House. Sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. It was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. It speaks volumes about the merits of the Church in our daily lives. This simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "3  When a rare shark was caught, scientists were left blundering for answers. This shark has a unique feature. And it’s not that it can survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time. This shark’s unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth. If you’ve ever seen the hit science fiction movie “Alien,” this shark is that monster made manifest on earth. This shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite. It’s a deadly predator of the deep sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides its telescoping teeth, this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in 1986. In the three decades since it was first found, just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut during a routine survey in the Donghe Township in Taiwan, the country’s Fisheries Research Institute found five of these horrifying deep-sea sharks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team was notably horrified and described “the most obvious feature are the needle-shaped teeth, like snake-like fangs. This is also the origin of viper shark name.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s right. This beast is called the viper shark. And as you can tell by its name, it is ferocious with its prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals, little is known about them. But researchers think these creatures swim between 300-400 meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to 150 meters below at night. Could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of 350 meters below the surface of the sea. Four were already dead. But a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater. But it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat. It perished just a day later.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile viper sharks look like the Alien monster from the movie, they do not feed on humans. Their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes. One of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish. These creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glow-in-the-dark bodies. And when they swim close enough, the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of Shikoku Island in Japan in 1986. Bottom-trawler vessel Seiryo-Maru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the fish was a new discovery at the time, it’s scientific name honors the Seiryo-Maru captain, Hiromichi Kabeya. The shark’s scientific name was Trigonognathus kabeyai.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough not much about these fish are known, scientists classify them in as a dogfish shark. They have only been found in the deep parts of the Pacific Ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow would you react if this shark came up on the other end of your fishing line? Would you think you were having a nightmare?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "4  Donald Trump has the unnerving ability to ability to create his own reality and convince millions of Americans that what he says it is true. The problem with the president lying is that he then believes his own lies. A new poll shows how that can get the country into deep trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new ABC News/Washington Post poll came out after the president’s physician gave him a physical and mental exam. The doctor gave Trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis poll was able to capture Americans’ opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around Trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. In addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear Trump tell the public that he was a “very stable genius” before they were interviewed. He said:\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ABC/Washington Post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. That left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, there was the question of Trump’s mental stability. The poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. When asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ABC News/Washington Post poll was taken from January 15 through 18, 2018. The random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both English and Spanish.

      "0      sometimes the power of christmas will make you do wild and wonderful things. you do not need to believe in the holy trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. the simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. one congregation in ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on christmas eve. the pastor at grand lake united methodist church in celina, ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of jesus.\\nfor many religious people the message of jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. the sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time but what would a generous act look like in our times? that was the focus of the sermon.\\nthe potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! after the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. a bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this christmas eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.\\nwhat did they do with this offering? members of the congregation drove down to the local waffle house to visit the ladies working the night shift. what a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!\\nthe ladies working at waffle house clearly were not with their families. they had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. the congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. they donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at waffle house.\\nin total that amounted to $3,500 being split amongst the staff. what a beautiful moment! what a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! doing a good deed like this on christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at waffle house. sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.\\nperhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. it was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. it speaks volumes about the merits of the church in our daily lives. this simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.

      "3      when a rare shark was caught, scientists were left blundering for answers. this shark has a unique feature. and it's not that it can survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time. this shark's unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth. if you've ever seen the hit science fiction movie \"alien,\" this shark is that monster made manifest on earth. this shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite. it's a deadly predator of the deep sea.\\nbesides its telescoping teeth, this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in 1986. in the three decades since it was first found, just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found.\\nbut during a routine survey in the donghe township in taiwan, the country's fisheries research institute found five of these horrifying deep-sea sharks.\\nthe team was notably horrified and described \"the most obvious feature are the needle-shaped teeth, like snake-like fangs. this is also the origin of viper shark name.\"\\nthat's right. this beast is called the viper shark. and as you can tell by its name, it is ferocious with its prey.\\nalthough researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals, little is known about them. but researchers think these creatures swim between 300-400 meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to 150 meters below at night. could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light?\\nthe last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of 350 meters below the surface of the sea. four were already dead. but a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater. but it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat. it perished just a day later.\\nwhile viper sharks look like the alien monster from the movie, they do not feed on humans. their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes. one of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish. these creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glow-in-the-dark bodies. and when they swim close enough, the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole.\\nthe first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of shikoku island in japan in 1986. bottom-trawler vessel seiryo-maru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea.\\nbecause the fish was a new discovery at the time, it's scientific name honors the seiryo-maru captain, hiromichi kabeya. the shark's scientific name was trigonognathus kabeyai.\\nalthough not much about these fish are known, scientists classify them in as a dogfish shark. they have only been found in the deep parts of the pacific ocean.\\nhow would you react if this shark came up on the other end of your fishing line? would you think you were having a nightmare?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "4      donald trump has the unnerving ability to ability to create his own reality and convince millions of americans that what he says it is true. the problem with the president lying is that he then believes his own lies. a new poll shows how that can get the country into deep trouble.\\nthe new abc news/washington post poll came out after the president's physician gave him a physical and mental exam. the doctor gave trump a clean bill of health, added an inch to his height, and claimed he was fit to serve for seven more years.\\nthis poll was able to capture americans' opinions after a new book came out indicating that people around trump questioned his emotional stability and ability to hold office. in addition, the new poll gave the respondents the time to hear trump tell the public that he was a \"very stable genius\" before they were interviewed. he said:\\n'actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.'\\nthe abc/washington post poll discovered that 21 percent of the people it interviewed believed that the president was a genius. that left a full 73 percent who saw through that lie.\\nthen, there was the question of trump's mental stability. the poll found that there was a nearly even divide throughout the nation. when asked if the president was stable, 47 percent of those interviewed said he was not, but 48 percent believed he is stable.\\nthe abc news/washington post poll was taken from january 15 through 18, 2018. the random sample consisted of 1,005 adults interviewed by landline and cell phone in both english and spanish. the margin of error was +/- 3.5 percentage points.\\nfeatured image via getty images/drew angerer

      "245    prison for rahm, god's work and many others\\nheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!\\nby karl denninger, market ticker:\\nhow do you know when a nation is about to collapse?\\nit becomes so lawless that hiding the abuses is no longer necessary. they're undertaken in full daylight, boldly, by those in charge. and, usually, they start to involve victimizing kids not so much because it's easier (it's plenty easy to victimize adults when nobody goes to prison and you've turned every man into a eunuch on top of it) but because you start to run out of adults to vicimize so all that's left is kids.\\nthe poster child for this is of course zuckerberg and facebook, which the founding president of has admitted uses psychological trickery to addict people to the site, and now has chosen to abuse children. you'd think that when a business starts peddling the equivalent of drugs to kids that the cops would show up, haul everyone involved off in chains and destroy the company involved but you'd be wrong facebook's stock closed at $172 yesterday, for a market cap of $502 billion. every single penny of that should be forfeit right here, right now.\\noh, speaking of abusing children, if you're a sorta little guy you might get arrested for prostituting kids. maybe. it seems that being a state senator is not far enough up the power ladder to evade going to jail. i hope that guy has a nice supply of vasoline, as i have been told prison inmates just loooove those who like to screw kids. now about zucker****er; yeah, i know, it's not sex just totally buttraping the future of said kids by diddling their minds so it doesn't count. right?\\nit's just facebook you say, or some state senator? uh, no. how about google and youtube? oh by the way, as youtube \"allegedly\" tries to \"clean this up\" i can tell you with certainty that they are de-monetizing videos that absolutely are family-friendly. how do i know? they flagged one of my daughter's which featured wait for it a hike up a hill with her pussy cat. there was utterly nothing objectionable in any way, shape or form in that video, but since she was out of town and i noted the lack of ads i filed the protest for her. they turned it back on. instead of looking before killing it in the first place, of course, they just used a computer to do it, you see, because 30 seconds of actual looking would have disclosed.. a cat and a hike. it also would have meant google would have made a bit less money to actually employ people, and, well, we can't have that. jobs? forget about it.\\nthen there's chicago and goldman's latest fraud, and what a doozey that one is. the city, which incidentally is basically bankrupt and has insane pension liabilities, created a \"new\" corporation, assigned it alleged \"preference\" for sales tax revenues, and then had it issue bonds in order to game the ratings. the result? a \"aaa\" rated bond issue for a bankrupt municipality. may i remind you that if you tried this you'd be tossed in prison for 30 years for fraud and the entire set of transactions would be unwound because you cannot structure your finances to avoid paying creditors after the event that gives rise to the liability has happened. for example, you cannot get into a car accident where you're at fault and then put your assets in a trust to avoid losing them in the ensuing lawsuit.\\nyet that's exactly what chicago did with goldman's help to both set it up and run the bond offering. this is blatant and outrageous fraud upon every single previous creditor, and if you or i tried it not only would the transaction be unwound we'd be indicted on top of it. well? where are the handcuffs on rahm and why isn't goldman shut down right here and now as a criminal enterprise with mr. god's work being led off in cuffs?\\nthen you have the grand-daddy of all, which is quite-clearly outlined here not that if you've read my column you need another example. it deals with the medical scam. just a few miles south having your appendix removed is 1/10th of the cost of having it done here. the difference? blatant and lawless behavior that violates 100+ year old anti-trust law. this law is not just civil in nature either; it is a felony to even attempt to monopolize trade or commerce.\\nmay i remind you that this body of law (15 usc chapter 1, sections 1 and 2) do not require that prices go up, although in the case of medical care of all sorts they sure as hell have by a factor of 10 or more. the reason the law was written to not require pricing to increase is that it is extremely common for monopolists to cross-subsidize that is, screw someone else so you think you're getting a \"deal\". it's illegal irrespective of price rises (or not) for the precise reason that the people who wrote the law at the time were well-aware that it is trivial for large, powerful corporations to cost-shift and thus hide what they're doing, making it appear that you're getting a reasonable deal when in fact they're jacking people up the cornhole left, right and center.\\namazon anyone?\\nsteve forbes recently wrote on this but he has no sack either for he has refused to use the \"f\" word consistently and over decades. see, people don't want to use the \"f\" word (no, not ****, felony) because if the american public was to actually start reading said law, and realized that the first two sections consisted of all of a couple of paragraphs and nowhere is there a requirement that prices go up (never mind that they sure as hell have in the medical field) they might pick up pitchforks and torches and demand that people start going to prison right now \"or else.\"\\ni mean it's not like hospital administrators (who provide zero care to patients) have risen in count by over 3,000% while doctors have risen by something like 100% from 1970 to today, or medical costs have gone up 800% while wages have risen 16%. oh wait..\\npeople have told me that i'm being completely unrealistic when i point out that fixing this would cause medical costs to drop by 80% or more, making \"insurance\" completely unnecessary for 95% of all things medical and the cost of insurance for the remaining 5% about as expensive on an annual basis as one nice night out on the town. in other words with the exception of the truly destitute nobody would need any help at all from government or anywhere else.\\ndon't tell me that this outcome is impossible either; if you're older than 45 or so your parents did exactly that when you were a child. were you stoned when you were six or are you intentionally refusing to face facts? i remember the doctor's office exactly where the building was, the waiting room (divided into two sections; one for well kids there for routine things, the other for sick kids an attempt to avoid getting the well kids sick!), the front desk (where you paid, natch) and the little exam rooms. i also remember my very-much middle class mother writing a check for the modest cost incurred. there were no insurance cards and no angst about a visit to the doctor, if you really needed one. you called, you showed up, you had whatever you needed attended to taken care of, you wrote a check and left.\\nthat's because it didn't bankrupt you.\\nread more @ market-ticker.org\\nsource: https://www.sgtreport.com/articles/2017/12/6/prison-for-rahm-gods-work-and-many-others\n",
      "246    4 useful items for your tiny home\\nheadline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next!\\nwhile a tiny home is great because of its low price compared to a bigger property, the limitations on space mean you must make other adjustments with how you furnish it. a certain degree of creative thinking is needed to fit in the kind of useful things that will help make the place feel homely but also not cramped at the same time.\\nroyalty free photo\\nthere are also a few essentials that you'll find you won't want to go without regardless of space considerations. think about how much each item weighs because one of the points of a tiny home is going minimalist in the number and the weight of all your possessions.\\nlet's take a look at four useful items that your tiny home cannot easily do without.\\nwasher & dryer machine\\nwhile it's possible to do without the washer and dryer equipment, having to trek your dirty laundry down to the laundromat every week gets old real fast. if you don't have a car, you'll have to carry it over your shoulder or in a backpack which won't be too comfortable either. it's true that making the space for the washing in your tiny home isn't easy, but it's well worth it. to cut down on the floor space used, there are combination units you can buy to avoid having separate ones. pair the washer and dryer machine with a drying rack that works both inside or outside your home (weather dependent) and you're all set.\\nspace heater\\nit might be warm enough now, but when the temperature drops you will be glad you bought a space heater to warm up the place. these products are now more energy efficient than in the past with thermostats to turn them off when the home reaches an agreeable temperature. they are also not as expensive to run as you'd think because you're not having to heat multiple rooms; the warmth spreads around the home evenly as it radiates out.\\nsmall refrigerator\\nwhen it comes to the refrigerator, there are a good number of choices available. you can, of course, look for a tall refrigerator to take maximum advantage of the height of your home. however, these units do use considerable amounts of energy. a compact refrigerator that might even fit under a well-designed kitchen counter top is ideal because you can reach it without having to stretch up. alternatively, installing a refrigerator under the stairs or as part of a wall are other options if you're really trying to save space and don't care about the unit being in the kitchen area.\\ncomposting toilet facility\\nhaving a toilet is a must for most tiny home owners. you don't want to have to rely on local facilities in the dead of night when you get caught short. the composting version doesn't use water and is environmentally friendly. it's easy to empty on a regular basis and doesn't take up too much space either. there's also no black water tank, so it's more convenient that way too.\\nyour tiny home doesn't need too many items to feel comfy, but there are some that we'd think are essential to your overall enjoyment. you want to avoid adding too many extras in your tiny home as the point is to live small, but there are some things you just cannot do without.

Grey's Anatomy star Eric Dane dies at 53 after ALS diagnosis,2026-02-20T07:19:44.481Z," Jessica Murphy
","Eric Dane, the actor best known for his roles on Grey's Anatomy and Euphoria, has died less than a year after revealing he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was 53.
Dane starred as family patriarch Cal Jacobs on hit HBO teen drama show Euphoria. Before that, he was perhaps best known as Dr Mark Sloan, or 'Dr McSteamy', on medical drama Grey's Anatomy.
The California-born actor was diagnosed last year with ALS and spent the last few months raising awareness for the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).
""With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS,"" reads a statement from his family.
He was married to fellow actress and model Rebecca Gayheart, with whom he had two children.
The written statement said he spent his final days surrounded by friends and his devoted wife, and his two daughters, Billie and Georgia, ""who were the center of his world"".
""He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he's received,"" it said.
Dane also played Jason Dean in fantasy drama series Charmed, and Captain Tom Chandler in action drama show The Last Ship, while appearing in films such as Marley & Me, Valentine's Day and Burlesque.
ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare degenerative disease that causes progressive paralysis of the muscles.
It affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, causing patients to slowly lose their ability to speak, eat, walk and breathe independently.
Last summer, Dane told ABC network's Good Morning America that his diagnosis made him ""angry"".
""Because, you know, my father was taken from me when I was young,"" he told the programme.
""And now, you know, there's a very good chance I'm going to be taken from my girls while they're very young"".
His father died by suicide when Dane was seven years old.
The actor was born in San Francisco in 1972 and made his television debut in the Wonder Years in 1993.
Dane's Grey's Anatomy co-stars are leading tributes to the late actor.
Kim Raver - who plays doctor Teddy Altman in the series - said: ""During filming he'd get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you.""
Kevin McKidd, who plays trauma surgeon Owen Hunt, posted ""rest in peace buddy"" on Instagram.
Euphoria creator Sam Levinson told Variety: ""I'm heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend.""
""Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift,"" he said.

Correction 20 February 2026: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Kim Raver played Eric Dane's on-screen wife in Grey's Anatomy. Their characters had a short-lived romance but were not married.

New Mexico reopens criminal inquiry into Jeffrey Epstein's Zorro Ranch,2026-02-20T01:41:26.670Z," Nardine Saad
","The US state of New Mexico will reopen a criminal probe into a ranch once owned by Jeffrey Epstein, following allegations that surfaced in justice department files on the convicted sex offender.
State prosecutors said they would seek full access to unredacted Epstein files relating to the Zorro Ranch, held by federal investigators in Washington DC.
They also pledged to work with a so-called Epstein truth commission set up this week in New Mexico.
The state shelved its initial investigation into the ranch in 2019 upon request from federal prosecutors in New York. Epstein, who died in a Manhattan jail in 2019, faced no charges in New Mexico.
State Attorney General Raúl Torrez said on X that his office ""will take a broad and comprehensive"" look at the Zorro Ranch.
He said they would work with an Epstein truth commission, set up by state legislators on Tuesday.
The bipartisan, four-member panel is investigating allegations that the ranch might have facilitated sexual abuse and sex trafficking.
One of the state legislators on the panel, Andrea Romero of Santa Fe, told the BBC: ""We are learning that there may have been reports to the FBI, back in 2019 or prior to, of bodies being buried, of folks being trafficked.""
On Wednesday, the state said it was investigating a 2019 email from the recently released tranche of files that alleged Epstein had ordered the bodies of two foreign girls be buried outside the ranch, Reuters news agency reported.
US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said last week he was seeking an unredacted copy of the email, which came from an anonymous sender.
Lawmakers on the commission also want to know why Epstein did not register as a sex offender after having pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008.
While Epstein did not face any charges in New Mexico, prosecutors in the south-western US state confirmed in 2019 that they had interviewed possible victims who visited the property.
A number of women have previously alleged they were recruited and abused by the convicted paedophile at Zorro Ranch, which they said was integral to his sex-trafficking operation.
Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico told the BBC: ""In Zorro Ranch, it was very isolated, very beautiful landscape.
""We have heard very disturbing reports of some of the activity going on there.""
She added: ""We know that there are horrible things that occurred at that ranch.""
There are thousands of references to the ranch, located south of Santa Fe, in the millions of documents released in late January by the US justice department.
It boasts a 21,000sq ft mansion on a hilltop overlooking nearly 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of desert. Nearby was a private airstrip and helipad.
Epstein bought the property in 1993 from former New Mexico Governor Bruce King.
According to Reuters, he leased around 1,250 acres of state lands around the ranch that same year.
But the New Mexico State Land Commission cancelled the leases in September 2019 after the office determined that Epstein had used the tract as a privacy buffer - not for ranching or agriculture.
Zorro Ranch is now owned by former Texas state Senator Don Huffines, who purchased the property from the Epstein estate in 2023. He pledged proceeds from the sale to the late sex-trafficker's victims.

Trump directs US government to prepare release of files on aliens and UFOs,2026-02-20T01:36:37.221Z," Grace Eliza Goodwin
","US President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to ""begin the process of identifying and releasing"" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life.
Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said ""aliens are real"" on a podcast last week.
""He's not supposed to be doing that,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: ""He made a big mistake.""
Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: ""Well, I don't know if they're real or not.""
Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday.
""They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,"" Obama said.
""There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.""
After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it's statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe.
In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: ""I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!""
Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire ""lightning"" round of questions on the podcast.
There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.
For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and ""doesn't have an opinion on it"".
Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that ""based on the tremendous interest shown"" he will seek the release of files ""related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters"".
In a 2024 report, the Pentagon said there was ""no evidence"" that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects.
In 2023, the US House of Representatives held a panel on unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAPs), known more colloquially as UFOs.
The hearing produced no major bombshells or confirmation of alien life.

'Who's next?' - American lawmakers call for 'justice' in the US after Andrew arrest,2026-02-19T21:29:09.183Z," Ana Faguy and Helena Humphrey
Washington
","Members of Congress have urged the US government to take action against associates of Jeffrey Epstein, following the arrest in the UK of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
""Prince Andrew was just arrested,"" Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman who co-sponsored the law that compelled the justice department to release the Epstein files, wrote on X. ""Now we need JUSTICE in the United States.""
The King's brother, who was stripped of his titles last year due to his ties with Epstein, has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing.
Lawmakers have asked the former prince to come to the US to testify about his ties to the late sex offender.
Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, who is ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told the BBC that if the former prince did ""nothing wrong, then he should clear his name"".
""There's a lot more we want from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor at this point and so our door is open and we will talk to him on his terms,"" Subramanyam said. ""I will fly out to the UK if I have to. Whatever he wants to do.""
Calling the arrest a ""huge breakthrough"", Subramanyam said Mountbatten-Windsor could not be legally compelled to come to the US to testify.
""I think a lot of victims actually liked seeing him lose his title,"" Subramanyam, a Democrat from Virginia, said. ""They knew how involved he was with Epstein and Maxwell and saw that for decades now there has been a lack of accountability for rich and powerful people.""
Subramanyam said that seeing an arrest result from lawmakers' investigations, along with years of victims speaking out, shows that some accountability is beginning to take hold.
Along with Democratic congressman Ro Khanna of California, Kentucky congressman Massie co-sponsored the law that compelled the justice department to release the Epstein files last year.
They said their actions are among the reasons for Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest.
""Even princes are not above the law,"" Khanna wrote on social media.
""[Massie]⁩ & I forced the release of an email showing former prince Andrew allegedly shared state information with Epstein. On Feb 9th, I called on King Charles to investigate & answer questions.""
Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace said she was the only member of Congress to publicly call for the arrest of the former prince.
""Today, on his 66th birthday, that call was answered,"" she said. ""Who's next? We will not stop until every co-conspirator, every enabler, and every powerful figure who hid behind wealth and connections is held fully accountable. No one is above the law.""
President Donald Trump also weighed in on Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest.
Talking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, Trump said: ""I think it's a shame, I think it's very sad, I think it's so bad for the royal family.
""I think it's a very sad thing. It's really interesting because nobody used to speak about Epstein when he was alive, but now they speak.""
The specifics of the allegations of misconduct in public office against Mountbatten-Windsor remain unclear, but they do not relate to any sexual offences.
Police in the UK said they were assessing a complaint over the alleged sharing of confidential material by the former prince with Epstein.
Mountbatten-Windsor is among a long list of high-profile names included in the Epstein files released by the justice department, including Elon Musk, Bill Gates, US President Donald Trump, former US President Bill Clinton, Richard Branson, Peter Mandelson and Sarah Ferguson.
Many people whose names were included in the document have denied wrongdoing, and being named in the files does not imply criminal activity.
But US lawmakers have said they are committed to continuing their investigation, regardless.
""No one connected to Jeffrey Epstein will escape accountability for their crimes,"" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee wrote on social media after Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest.
""Our work is just beginning, and we will pursue justice for every individual who participated in the abuse of women and girls.""
Subramanyam and fellow congressman Robert Garcia previously requested Lord Mandelson, the former British Ambassador to the US, to sit for a deposition regarding his relationship with Epstein.
On Thursday, Garcia said that request had been denied because Lord Mandelson's lawyers said ""he is unable to appear due to the ongoing investigation by the Metropolitan Police"".

Two sisters among those killed in Lake Tahoe avalanche,2026-02-20T01:15:26.331Z," Nardine Saad
Los Angeles
California
","The skiers who died in an avalanche in California's Lake Tahoe backcountry are said to have been part of a tight-knit group who often went on ski excursions together.
Eight people died after an avalanche struck near Castle Peak in the Sierra Nevada mountains on Tuesday, and rescue teams are searching for a ninth who is presumed dead.
Families named six of the victims on Thursday, saying ""they were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors"". Six members of the 15-person ski group were rescued early this week.
The ""football-field sized"" avalanche - the deadliest in modern California history - hit during the popular ""ski week"" holidays in the state.
The identities of the six - all women - were shared by a family spokesperson with the BBC's US media partner, CBS News. They are: Caroline Sekar, Liz Clabaugh, Carrie Atkin, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, and Kate Vitt, all from either the Bay Area, Idaho, or the Truckee-Tahoe region.
""We are devastated beyond words,"" a statement from the families said.
""Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women.""
The families have asked for privacy during this period of sudden grief.
Sekar, 45, of San Francisco, and Clabaugh, 52, of Boise, Idaho, were sisters, their brother told the New York Times.
McAlister Clabaugh, 50, said that many in the group of 11 skiers had been friends since university and would regularly meet for ski trips.
""These are two of the best people I've ever known,"" Clabaugh said. ""They were incredible sisters, mothers, wives and friends. And the idea that they are both gone is, I don't even know how to put it into words.""
Max Perrey, the mayor of nearby Mill Valley, told local media that some of the 11 clients on the ski trip, including at least one who died, were mothers from his city, which is in nearby Marin County.
One of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts ""challenging emotionally"", according to Sheriff Wayne Woo, from neighbouring Placer County.
Three guides from the Blackbird Mountain Guides, who were leading the group back from a three-day backcountry skiing expedition, were killed in the avalanche, according to the company.
Sugar Bowl Academy, a ski school in Placer County, California, said multiple members of its community had died in the avalanche but declined to identify them due to ongoing search efforts.
""Emergency responders are still working to recover all of the victims and are not at this time sharing the personal details of the victims and the survivors out of respect for the families affected,"" the academy said.
""We are an incredibly close and connected community,"" executive director Stephen McMahon said. ""This tragedy has affected each and every one of us. The depth of support for the families whose lives have been changed forever reminds us of how special this community is.""
The avalanche swept away 15 people who were making their way back from the ski trip.
Rescuers, stymied by inclement weather, so far have located the bodies of seven women and a man killed in the avalanche.
The extraction of the victims stalled on Thursday due to hazardous weather conditions, the Nevada County Sheriff's Office, which is leading the search, said on Thursday.
Recovery efforts are expected to carry into the weekend. The Nevada County Sheriff's Office said on Thursday that it is unable to confirm the identifications, ages, affiliations, or cities of origin for the victims until the recovery mission is completed.
The heavy snowstorm has prevented rescuers from transporting the bodies from the backcountry to a morgue in the nearby town of Truckee, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Moon said the search continues for a second man from the group who is presumed dead.
Placer County Sheriff Woo has urged the public to avoid the Sierras, mountain travel and the backcountry during inclement weather over the next few days so that officials can focus on recovering the bodies.
On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued another winter weather advisory for the greater Lake Tahoe area that said another 6-12in (15-30cm) of snow is expected to accumulate in the Tahoe basin, with more at higher elevations.
Ridge winds were expected to gust as high as 45mph (72km/h) on Thursday evening, causing poor visibility and near whiteout conditions.

Nasa boss says Boeing Starliner failure one of worst in its history,2026-02-20T01:44:48.300Z," Osmond Chia
Business reporter
","Nasa has labelled the botched 2024 Starliner mission, which left two astronauts stranded in space for months, a ""Type A"" mishap, on par with fatal shuttle disasters of the past, in a newly published report.
The category is the space agency's most severe, reserved for incidents causing more than $2m (£1.49 m) in damage, the loss of a vehicle or its control, or deaths.
On Thursday, Nasa's new boss, Jared Isaacman, blasted Boeing, which built Starliner, and the space agency for poor decision-making and leadership that led to the failed mission.
The incident drew global attention after the pilots were stuck for more than nine months in space before returning home last March.
Isaacman, an amateur jet pilot who was the first non-professional astronaut to conduct a spacewalk, took Nasa's top job in late 2025 after a second nomination by US President Donald Trump.
His approval came after a turbulent process in which Trump put forward Isaacman's name for the role but then withdrew it during a public feud with Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk, who is a close ally of Isaacman.
In a statement on Starliner's findings, Isaacman said the spacecraft had faced issues throughout its prior recent missions but had still been accepted for the test.
""We are correcting those mistakes. Today, we are formally declaring a Type A mishap and ensuring leadership accountability so situations like this never reoccur.""
Nasa's ""Type A"" grade puts the Starliner incident at the same level assigned to the fatal 2003 Columbia and 1986 Challenger space shuttle disasters.
The agency said in its statement: ""While there were no injuries and the mission regained control prior to docking, this highest-level classification designation recognises there was potential for a significant mishap.""
Nasa's 312-page report comes after the agency commissioned an independent investigation team to identify the causes behind the troubled mission.
Investigators flagged hardware failures, leadership missteps and cultural problems at the organisations that led to conditions that fell short of the space agency's safety standards.
The report also highlighted poor engineering and a lack of oversight at Boeing, which helped turn an eight-to-14-day mission into a months-long ordeal for the test pilots, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore.
The pair waited months on board the International Space Station before getting a lift from a SpaceX flight in March 2025. Both pilots have since retired from the agency.
Nasa said it will accept this as the final report and is taking corrective actions to address the findings.
""While Boeing built Starliner, Nasa accepted it and launched two astronauts to space,"" Isaacman said.
""To undertake missions that change the world, we must be transparent about both our successes and our shortcomings. We have to own our mistakes and ensure they never happen again.""

Microsoft error sees confidential emails exposed to AI tool Copilot,2026-02-19T18:16:43.596Z," Liv McMahon
Technology reporter
","Microsoft has acknowledged an error causing its AI work assistant to access and summarise some users' confidential emails by mistake.
The tech giant has pushed Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat as a secure way for workplaces and their staff to use its generative AI chatbot.
But it said a recent issue caused the tool to surface information to some enterprise users from messages stored in their drafts and sent email folders - including those marked as confidential.
Microsoft says it has rolled out an update to fix the issue, and that it ""did not provide anyone access to information they weren't already authorised to see"".
However, some experts warned the speed at which companies compete to add new AI features meant these kinds of mistakes were inevitable.
Copilot Chat can be used within Microsoft programs such as Outlook and Teams, used for emails and chat functions, to get answers to questions or summarise messages.
""We identified and addressed an issue where Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat could return content from emails labelled confidential authored by a user and stored within their Draft and Sent Items in Outlook desktop,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told BBC News.
""While our access controls and data protection policies remained intact, this behaviour did not meet our intended Copilot experience, which is designed to exclude protected content from Copilot access,"" they added.
""A configuration update has been deployed worldwide for enterprise customers.""
The blunder was first reported by tech news outlet Bleeping Computer, which said it had seen a service alert confirming the issue.
It cited a Microsoft notice saying ""users' email messages with a confidential label applied are being incorrectly processed by Microsoft 365 Copilot chat"".
The notice added that a work tab within Copilot Chat had summarised email messages stored in a user's drafts and sent folders, even when they had a sensitivity label and a data loss prevention policy configured to prevent unauthorised data sharing.
Reports suggest Microsoft first became aware of the error in January.
Its notice about the bug was also shared on a support dashboard for NHS workers in England - where the root cause is attributed to a ""code issue"".
A section of the notice on the NHS IT support site implies it has been affected.
But it told BBC News the contents of any draft or sent emails processed by Copilot Chat would remain with their creators, and patient information has not been exposed.
Enterprise AI tools such as Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat - available to organisations with a Microsoft 365 subscription - often have stricter controls and security protections in place to prevent sharing of sensitive corporate information.
But for some experts, the issue still highlights risks of adopting generative AI tools in certain work environments.
Nader Henein, data protection and AI governance analyst at Gartner, said ""this sort of fumble is unavoidable"", given the frequency of ""new and novel AI capabilities"" being released.
He told BBC News organisations using these AI products often lack tools needed to protect themselves and manage each new feature.
""Under normal circumstances, organisations would simply switch off the feature and wait till governance caught up,"" Henein said.
""Unfortunately the amount of pressure caused by the torrent of unsubstantiated AI hype makes that near-impossible,"" he added.
Cyber-security expert Professor Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey said it showed the importance of making such tools private-by-default and opt-in only.
""There will inevitably be bugs in these tools, not least as they advance at break-neck speed, so even though data leakage may not be intentional it will happen,"" he told BBC News.

Trump-appointed panel approves White House ballroom project,2026-02-19T17:27:23.003Z," Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu
Washington
","The US Commission of Fine Arts overwhelmingly approved design plans for President Donald Trump's ballroom project at the White House.
The panel made up of Trump appointees signed off on the design after architects made changes in response to commission concerns.
""We have to protect the country and the country's guests, and this is a facility that is definitely needed for over 150 years,"" Chairman Rodney Mims Cook Jr said.
The East Wing of the White House was demolished last autumn to make way for the ballroom.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit, sued to halt ballroom construction, saying plans for the project did not comply with the legally mandated review processes.
Trump has argued the White House needs a ballroom because present facilities are inadequate to host important national events and foreign dignitaries.
He has said the building will be ""the most beautiful ballroom anywhere in the world"" and will be paid for with money donated from private sources. The ballroom was initially expected to have capacity of 500 people but it has since been expanded to 1350.
The ballroom project has faced stiff opposition from historic preservation groups and sections of the public.
""No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever - not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,"" the National Trust for Historic Preservation said in its federal lawsuit.
""And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in."" The case is still in litigation.
The commission's Secretary Thomas Luebke said the panel had received over 2,000 comments from the public and that they were ""overwhelmingly in opposition - over 99% to this project"".
Commission Vice Chairman James McCrery abstained from discussions and the vote at Thursday's meeting. His architecture firm was initially selected by Trump to handle the ballroom, but the administration switched architects on the project to Shalom Baranes.
Two new Trump-appointed members of the commission were sworn in at the start of the meeting, including Chamberlain Harris, a White House aide.
The ballroom project still needs approval from the 12-member panel of the National Capital Planning Commission, whose next meeting to discuss the ballroom is in early March.
Six of its members are Trump-appointees and two others are Republicans from the US Congress.
The ballroom is not the only major construction Trump is pursuing in the US capital. He has also announced plans to build a triumphal arch as part of plans to mark the nation's 250th anniversary.

US trade deficit hits fresh high despite Trump's tariffs,2026-02-19T17:19:16.278Z," Natalie Sherman
Business reporter
","US goods imports continued to outpace its exports last year, sending the country's trade deficit to a new high despite sweeping tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump.
The gap between the value of goods imported into the US and American products sold to other countries widened by 2.1% compared to 2024, hitting roughly $1.2 trillion (£890bn), official figures show.
The rise emerged despite a sharp drop in trade with China, one of the earliest targets of the tariffs.
The gap runs counter to one of the White House's key aims which is to reduce the deficit, arguing that US reliance on overseas goods has hollowed out the country's production abilities and put national security at risk.
Last year, Trump introduced tariffs of at least 10% on goods from nearly every country in the world.
At the time, he said the new taxes on products coming into the US would help boost local manufacturing and make it easier for American firms to sell abroad.
The measures - which in some cases were much higher than before trade deals were struck - sparked widespread turmoil for businesses and global economies.
But while trade flows swung wildly, they did not stop.
Imports of goods - some of which US firms had rushed at the start of last year to get ahead of Trump's tariff regime - reached a record $3.4tn, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Business investment in artificial intelligence helped drive demand, as US imports of computer parts and equipment surged.
Exports also hit a new high, despite a drop in shipments of US food, cars and car parts, two of the sectors most exposed to the trade changes.
US trade with China, including imports and exports, fell to reduce the deficit by roughly 30% to $202.1bn. This was the smallest deficit for around in two decades.
But the US still recorded record trade gaps with several countries, including Mexico, Vietnam and Taiwan.
Overall, the deficit in goods and services - which takes into account things like travel and digital services - was $901.5bn last year, almost unchanged from $903.5bn in 2024.
The White House has also said it will take time for its efforts to pay off.
But Trump's frequent revisions to the tariffs have raised uncertainty about the strategy.
The president has used the threat of tariffs during international negotiations. Most recently, he signed an executive order stating the US would impose additional taxes on countries that continue to trade with Iran.
The Supreme Court is also currently weighing a challenge to the duties brought by a group of businesses and states, which could lead to the bulk of last year's tariffs being struck down.
If the Trump administration loses the case, White House officials have said they are prepared to reinstate the tariffs using different tools.
""Looking ahead there will inevitably be more rejiggering in supply chains, but we see scope for a modest ascent in imports in spite of tariffs in the year ahead,"" analysts at investment bank Wells Fargo wrote.
Meanwhile on Thursday, a report by the JP Morgan Chase Institute focusing on mid-size firms, found that many businesses had started shifting business away from China before the new tariffs went into effect.
Overall, the bank's data suggested foreign imports appeared little changed last year, despite monthly tariff payments roughly tripling.
""The broader effects of trade policy changes may only become apparent with a significant lag,"" the report concluded, noting policy uncertainty and the difficulty of finding alternate suppliers.

Trump's foreign policy dilemma laid bare by Iran tensions,2026-02-20T01:45:43.148Z," Daniel Bush
Washington correspondent
","US President Donald Trump delivered his latest ultimatum to Iran on Thursday during a meeting of the Board of Peace, the Middle East coalition Trump formed to stabilise a region he could soon plunge into a new war.
The irony of simultaneously calling for peace and threatening military action underscored the competing impulses at the heart of Trump's foreign policy in his second term.
Perhaps nowhere is that contradiction clearer than the impasse between Washington and Tehran - a standoff that has quickly escalated and could now lead to the largest US air campaign in years.
Trump has said he prefers a diplomatic solution in the form of a deal that ends Iran's nuclear weapons programme. A White House official said on Wednesday that Iran would be ""very wise"" to strike an agreement.
Yet for all the talk of diplomacy, Trump has ramped up his rhetoric against the Islamic Republic in recent weeks, and ordered what analysts say is the biggest US military buildup in the Middle East since the Iraq War in 2003.
It is another striking example of Trump's willingness to use military force more often than supporters had expected in his second term, and without prior approval from Congress.
Trump's threat to strike Iran cannot simply be dismissed as a negotiating tactic, since the last time he threatened an adversary with military action the US followed through with its attack on Venezuela in January.
That operation had a narrow military objective, at least as defined by the administration, and ended with the successful capture of former President Nicolás Maduro.
With Iran, the rationale for another military campaign is far less clear.
Trump does not want Tehran to develop nuclear weapons, a priority shared by US allies.
The Islamic Republic, which has been weakened by economic sanctions and mass protests against the regime led by the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has signalled it's open to negotiate on the issue of uranium enrichment.
The indirect talks between the US and Iran have stalled over the administration's insistence that Tehran also curb its ballistic missile programme and support for proxy groups in the region.
But while the negotiations may have deadlocked, Trump hasn't spelled out why attacking Iran again now - less than one year after a US strike last June - will yield the outcome he's after.
Trump has insisted the US strike on Iran last year ""obliterated"" the regime's nuclear facilities.
The president hasn't offered an explanation of why another strike is needed, if that is the case, or what, exactly, the new targets might be.
And unlike in Venezuela, Trump's broader objectives in Iran remain something of a mystery.
Does the administration want to usher in regime change in Iran?
Is the US prepared for an Iranian military response that would target American military bases in the region?
How might a prolonged conflict affect America's other strategic goals in the Middle East, including the Board of Peace-led process to rebuild Gaza?
Trump has offered few details on his thinking about potential day-after scenarios.
Israel's role in a potential attack also remains unclear.
Israel joined the US in striking Iran last year, and is widely expected to participate again if Trump launches a new military campaign.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump at the White House last week to discuss the situation.
With his first official State of the Union address of his second term looming next week, Trump also faces additional pressure to make the case for how a potential attack on Iran fits into his domestic political agenda.
Trump ran for the presidency in 2024 with a promise to disentangle the US from foreign conflicts - a stance that's popular with his Maga base and many Republicans in Congress who oppose US intervention in places like Ukraine.
Since taking office, however, Trump has launched numerous military attacks, including in Syria, Venezuela, Iran and on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.
An extended air campaign in Iran would risk alienating some supporters ahead of the US midterm elections, in a moment when opinion polls suggest voters are increasingly frustrated with Trump's handling of issues like immigration and the economy and when the president has drawn criticism for his focus on foreign affairs.
A major attack on Iran would also conflict with Trump's push for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Trump has said he deserves it for ending eight wars since the start of his second term, a claim that is widely disputed.
There is no precedent for a US president actively campaigning for the world's most prestigious peace prize while wielding American military force abroad.
All the uncertainty has left the rest of the world guessing about Trump's motivations in edging the US closer to war with Iran.
Still, that may be exactly how the president likes it.
Since returning to the White House last year, the president has seemingly relished playing the role of the world's dealmaker-in-chief.
Trump has presided over numerous signing ceremonies and international summits like the Board of Peace event on Thursday in Washington.
His tariffs regime forced other countries to seek more favourable trade deals with the US, placing Trump at the centre of high-stakes negotiations over the global economy.
Trump commanded worldwide attention last month with the strike on Venezuela and his call for the US to seize control of Greenland.
The dispute over Greenland was another instance where other nations struggled to interpret Trump's true intentions.
When it comes to Iran, Trump said on Thursday that the world would have to wait and see what he might do.
""We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen,"" he said.

US build-up of warships and fighter jets tracked near Iran,2026-02-19T18:57:06.449Z," Richard Irvine-BrownandAlex Murray
","BBC Verify has confirmed a second US aircraft carrier appears to be heading towards the Middle East, as Washington continues to put pressure on Iran over its military program and recent deadly crackdown on protesters.
USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, briefly broadcast its location as being off Morocco's Atlantic coast on Wednesday. In the 48 minutes where its location data was public, the vessel appeared to be heading towards the Mediterranean Sea.
But the carrier has not yet been sighted crossing the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean and an aircraft which operates from it was tracked returning to the Atlantic on Thursday.
US and Iranian officials met on Tuesday for a second round of talks, with progress reportedly made between negotiators in Switzerland. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the world will find out ""over the next, probably, 10 days"" whether the US will reach a deal with Iran or take military action.
On Monday, BBC Verify identified another aircraft carrier - USS Abraham Lincoln - in satellite images taken on Saturday off the coast of Oman, about 700km (430 miles) from Iran.
The arrival of two of the 11 aircraft carriers operated by the US Navy adds to what we know about the military build-up in the Middle East over the past few weeks, where BBC Verify has tracked an increase of destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.
Both Gerald R Ford and Abraham Lincoln lead strike groups with several guided missile destroyer warships. They are operated by more than 5,600 crew and carry dozens of aircraft.
USS Gerald R Ford switched on ship-tracking automatic identification system (AIS) for the first time in 2026 at 12:30 GMT on Wednesday. The carrier transmitted its location, visible on ship-tracking website MarineTraffic, until 13:18 and was sailing in the direction of the Mediterranean.
However, a transport aircraft attached to the carrier which landed in Spain on Wednesday was tracked at about 13:00 on Thursday heading towards the area where the aircraft carrier was spotted.
The appearance of Gerald R Ford comes after BBC Verify identified the Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea, around 240km (150 miles) off the coast of Oman, in publicly available images captured on Saturday by the European Sentinel-2 satellites.
The Abraham Lincoln had not been seen since it reportedly entered the region in January but it had been crossing the open sea where satellite coverage is limited. Military assets on land are more visible and frequently captured on satellite.
BBC Verify has now tracked 12 US ships in the Middle East: the Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered Nimitz-class carrier, which together with three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers forms a carrier strike group; plus two destroyers capable of carrying out long-range missile strikes and three specialist ships for combat near to the shore that are currently positioned at Bahrain naval station in the Gulf. Two other destroyers have been seen in the eastern Mediterranean near the Souda Bay US base, and one more in the Red Sea.
We have also been following the movements of large numbers of US aircraft to both European and Middle Eastern airbases, including:
F-35 and F-22 fighter jets
KC-135 and KC-46 refuelling tankers used to support the long-range movement of other aircraft
E-3 Sentry command and surveillance aircraft designed to coordinate large-scale operations
In response to recent US military movements, Iran has carried out its own show of force.
On Monday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran. The exercise saw IRGC Commander‑in‑Chief Maj Gen Mohammad Pakpour inspecting naval vessels at a harbour before missiles are seen launching from a ship, the IRGC-linked Tasnim News Agency reported.
The Strait is considered one of the world's most important shipping routes and a vital oil transit choke point. Around a fifth of the world's oil and gas flows through the Strait, including from Kharg Island, Iran's main oil export terminal. Pakpour was seen flying over the island in a helicopter in the report showing Iran's latest military manoeuvres.
Footage broadcast by Iranian state TV on Thursday also showed planned naval drills in the Gulf of Oman with Russia, which involved a simulated ship rescue operation.
The Fars news agency - which is affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - said ""operational units from both Iran's regular army's navy and the IRGC navy"" took part.
Military intelligence expert Justin Crump told BBC Verify that the current US military preparations in the Middle East show ""more depth and sustainability"" than its manoeuvres ahead of the seizure of former Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in January, or the operation carrying out air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last June.
They all feature a carrier strike group and several destroyers operating independently. However, the US deployed its assets in Venezuela and Iran last year under quite different circumstances.
The US deployed the Gerald R Ford to the Caribbean ahead of its strikes on Venezuela, one of eight warships we tracked in the region at the time, though it used fewer aircraft as it could easily send jets from surrounding US bases on America's mainland or from its base in Puerto Rico instead.
The US also deployed amphibious assault ships within the Caribbean, which can be used as launch platforms for helicopter operations as was seen with the capture of Maduro. But Venezuela's military is generally seen as less capable of defending itself or retaliating against the US.
When the US struck Iran last year in Operation Midnight Hammer, which targeted Iran's nuclear facilities, it was attacking a country with a much more powerful military than Venezuela. Iran's military is capable of hitting US bases across the Middle East.
The recent build-up in the region more closely resembles that seen during Operation Midnight Hammer. The US had two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region, five destroyers placed in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, and three combat ships in the Gulf.
It had also moved squadrons of fighter jets and refuelling aircraft from the US to Europe. But the B2 stealth bomber flights that were used to hit the Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites actually took off from US bases in Missouri.
Crump, chief executive of risk and intelligence company Sibylline, said the build-up of US warships and aircraft, as well as eight existing airbases in the region would allow it to conduct a ""fairly intensive and sustained strike rate"" of about 800 sorties a day, with the aim of rendering any Iranian responses ""ineffective"".
""What we are seeing isn't just strike preparation, but rather a broader deterrent deployment capable of being scaled up or down,"" he said. ""This means it has more depth and sustainability than the force packages arranged for either Venezuela or Midnight Hammer last year. It's designed to sustain an engagement and counter all potential responses against US assets in the region and, of course, Israel.""

How rescuers raced against time to reach skiers trapped in avalanche,2026-02-19T04:48:44.455Z," Max Matza
","When authorities in Truckee, California, learned of a large avalanche that hit a group of backcountry skiers, they rushed into action.
Emergency messages came on Tuesday at 11:30 local time (19:30 GMT) from a group guide's iPhone, using satellite-texting capabilities, as well as from another skier's emergency distress beacon.
The 15-person group was at the end of a three-day trip to the Frog Lake Huts in the popular Castle Peak mountain region when the avalanche struck, according to the Nevada County Sheriff's Office.
But with nearby Highway 80 closed due to an ongoing massive storm, it was a challenge to reach the group, and authorities had to improvise.
The trapped skiers were directly across the snow-blocked highway from the Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, also closed due to the weather, but the resort was able to deploy rescue teams in an attempt to reach them. Another nearby resort, Tahoe Donner's Alder Creek Adventure Center, also sent teams. Some used a snow-cat, a manned vehicle that runs on treads in order to move on top of deep snow. They are most commonly used for grooming ski runs, but can also transport people.
By Tuesday afternoon, around 50 rescuers were working to reach the site, arriving from both the south and north of the mountain. At 17:30, they arrived at an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.
The accident site was about as large as a football field, according to officials.
For rescuers in any avalanche, time is crucial. People who are fully buried under avalanche snow normally die from asphyxiation in less than one hour. But, roughly half of avalanche fatalities in North America are caused by blunt force trauma, rather than burial, according to a recent study.
Rescue teams, as well as the group trapped by the avalanche, used special climbing skins on the underside of their skis, allowing users to travel uphill and through the backcountry.
Eventually, they found a group of six alive, stranded on the mountain and trying desperately to shelter from the storm.
Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and ""could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche,"" said Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. One person remained missing as of Wednesday afternoon, and is presumed dead.

Authorities on Wednesday said it was too dangerous to try to recover the bodies of those killed- seven women and two men - until the weather clears. Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tours. The entire group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.
One of the deceased was the spouse of a rescuer, but Woo said that even with the personal tragedy, the rescue team remains focused.
""Everybody has circled around to provide their love and condolences for this family,"" Woo said. ""But I think it's also motivated the team of their purpose - to go out there and rescue those who were still alive, and now recover those decedents who are still out there.""
Avalanche danger in the region remains high due to an unstable base and new snow that continues to ""load"" dangerous slopes, according to forecasters with the Sierra Avalanche Center.
They had warned on Monday of naturally occurring avalanches starting far overhead, and eventually coming down through the clouds.
While it is unclear exactly how rescuers found the survivors, skiers buried in an avalanche typically are advised to try to stick a hand out of the snow to alert rescuers, create a shell with their arms to ease breathing for as long as possible, and remove skis to avoid being pulled deeper into the snow. And experts warn against panicking, which can lead to breathing too quickly.
Backcountry skiers usually carry a shovel, beacon and probe as a precaution.
Each of the skiers in the California group had a beacon, probably the most vital tool in emergencies, to send out a signal to help pinpoint the user's location. Most ski trips begin with skiers' beacons in transmit mode but after an avalanche, survivors switch beacons to search mode, which use arrows on the device's screen and audio cues, to help rescuers find them.
Other safety devices are growing in popularity, including backpacks that inflate to help avalanche survivors, however officials in California say it's not known whether anyone in the group was equipped with these devices.
Authorities had initially been told that the group was made up of 16 people, but later said they found out that one person had backed out of the trip at the last minute.

"Under pressure from Trump, Venezuela's new president has aces up her sleeve",2026-02-18T00:48:22.486Z," Alicia Hernández
BBC News Mundo
","A luminous outline of Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores loomed over Caracas against the night sky in January. The steady light of hundreds of drones in a show put on by the government in Venezuela, suspended their image in front of the clouds, before rearranging to call for their return: ""El pueblo los reclama,"" they spelled out, ""the people want them back"".
After a lightning operation by the US to spirit the deposed president and his wife out of the country on 3 January, Venezuela has found itself in limbo.
Despite Delcy Rodríguez, the former vice president and now acting Venezuelan leader, calling for the return of Maduro and Flores, there are no signs that's going to happen. The former first couple are in New York in Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center awaiting trial for alleged crimes including drug trafficking, all of which they deny.
Nevertheless, Rodríguez - a Maduro loyalist - must maintain a tricky equilibrium: appealing to her socialist base by continuing to support Maduro through anti-imperialist rhetoric, while at the same time changing policies under pressure from US President Donald Trump, with the threat that she could be following Maduro if she won't comply.
""Trump has implied that Venezuela is now a US protectorate, so she serves at the will of the US president,"" says Christopher Sabatini, senior research fellow on Latin America at Chatham House think tank. ""She has also been investigated by the DEA - there's not a conviction, or bounty on her head, or indictment, but that threat has hung out there. The threat is, 'we have the goods on you'."" The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) did not comment when approached by the BBC.
Rodríguez is now walking a diplomatic tightrope. ""President Maduro had already warned of an attack of this nature due to the desperation of the United States' energy voracity,"" Rodríguez said in her first statement after the operation. Yet shortly afterwards, Trump announced that Caracas had agreed to deliver up to 50 million barrels of oil - and that he would manage the money.
And in her first speech to the National Assembly on 16 January, Rodríguez criticised ""imperialist expansion by the United States"". That same day, Rodríguez met with CIA Director John Ratcliffe in Caracas. Rodríguez has been contacted for comment.
""Rodríguez's legitimacy lies in the military strength of the US. And it will last if Trump wants it to. She cannot stand up to him,"" says Carmen Beatriz Fernández, Venezuelan political analyst and CEO of DataStrategia, a political consultancy firm.
One question is how long Rodríguez can keep this double act of keeping both the Venezuelan left and the US administration onside? And if she had to choose, would it be a tough choice or does one side very obviously hold the power?
Caracas, Venezuela's capital city of around three million people, is festooned with banners calling for Maduro's return and decrying US interventionism.
""She is handling communication in the best possible way and establishing guidelines for the country to continue moving forward despite the hijacking,"" Leonardo Arca, 39, a civil servant, tells the BBC during a small pro-government march in Caracas last month. These big public displays calling for Maduro's return are usually organised by the government, and it's common for people to be told to go by their bosses.
He carries a banner that reads ""Free Cilia"". Other people carry signs that read ""Yankee go home"" or ""Bring them back"" in English.
Since Maduro and Flores were detained, what feels like years of changes have been crammed into a few short weeks.
The superpower of Chavismo, the left-wing political ideology that sustained the leaderships of Hugo Chavez and Maduro after him, is that it can quickly change course to keep the president - whoever that might be - in power.
On assuming the presidency on a ""temporary"" basis, Delcy Rodríguez - a lifelong Chavista - appointed mostly technocrats rather than ideologues with a nod to the need for pragmatism as Venezuela entered a new era.
Along with passing a law paving the way for US oil companies to start work in Venezuela, she also allowed for the release of numerous politicians and human rights activists who had been imprisoned for months or years. The opposition claims this has only happened because the US pressured them into it and point out that many political prisoners still remain in jail.
Trump has referred to Rodríguez as ""a wonderful person"" and ""someone we have worked very well with."" Rodríguez, in turn, has acknowledged that there have been telephone calls and said that the tone is ""courteous"" and ""mutually respectful.""
He has also acknowledged the diplomatic bind that Rodriguez is in. When asked by a reporter what he thought of her statements that Maduro is still the legitimate president, he dismissed it by saying: ""I think she probably has to say that.""
Rodríguez has avoided making inflammatory remarks against Trump. But she has used language deeply rooted in Latin American communist opposition to US expansionism, referring to the US as a ""lethal nuclear power"", ""invader"" and, ""imperialist"".
Phil Gunson, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank based in Caracas, says: ""Washington must understand that she must continue with this rhetoric. It is a way of maintaining cohesion in the Chavista project, even though it is known that it is not real.""
All experts we spoke to agree that the pressure and threat from the US on Venezuela and Rodríguez is real.
""US pressure may escalate,"" says Ana Milagros Parra, a Venezuelan political scientist. She says options for the US could include further intervention in Venezuelan territory, more economic sanctions and further oil blockades.
While Rodríguez must keep the leftist Chavismo grassroots happy, they only represent 15-20% of society and there are many Venezuelans who were never supportive of Maduro.
During his 13 years in power, Maduro's popularity waned. His 2024 election win was called into question after widespread international accusations that the vote was rigged. Opposition tallies collected by their election observers - which were independently reviewed - showed their candidate won 67% of the vote compared with Maduro's 30%. But nevertheless, Maduro assumed office claiming a 53% victory.
More than 7.9m Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, with 6.5m counted as refugees by the UNHCR, showing the scale of the civil and economic crisis that has gripped the country.
""This was not a popular government,"" Sabatini says. ""Most Venezuelans are feeling more optimistic about his removal.""
There is one major factor that could work in Rodríguez's favour: the promise of respite for the long-struggling Venezuelan economy. The country's inflation is by far the highest in the world, and 86% of Venezuelans were in poverty in 2024 according to the Venezuelan Finance Observatory.
Food in Venezuela is staggeringly expensive. Research carried out in 2025 found that a basic food shop composed of 60 everyday items cost $526.83 (£421). Venezuelans, battered by years of hyperinflation, are hoping US investment will ease the crisis but with the US focus so far firmly on the oil industry, it is not yet clear how much - and how quickly - any of it will trickle down to the average worker.
Delcy Rodríguez is also having to navigate a tricky balancing act within the military, who are loyal to Maduro.
Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello wields great power and Rodríguez is treating him cautiously. ""He sits atop not just a deeply corrupted military or national guard, but also a ragtag group of paramilitaries called the colectivos… They have been the shock troops sent to threaten protests,"" says Christopher Sabatini. ""This is his (Cabello's), if you will, private army. He has a $25m (£20m) bounty on his head in the US."" The BBC has contacted Cabello for comment.
While this bounty shows the US has him in its crosshairs, the two nonetheless appear together at events, showing an uneasy alliance. ""There's a theory that they're playing good-cop-bad-cop,"" Sabatini adds. ""She knows she needs him to maintain the security forces and keep them on her side… but as long as they don't interfere with her momentum of attracting investors and most of the elements of the Trump administration, he serves her purpose.""
Despite this massive balancing act and all the US's might, some argue that Rodríguez is not as powerless against Trump as it might first appear.
According to Sabatini, Trump is desperate for the world to see the extraction of Maduro as an unqualified success.
""Trump wants to see Venezuela continue on the path it's on, he doesn't want anything to contradict the narrative that everything is hunky dory. Trump doesn't want to see the oil hit the fan, so to speak.
""(So) she has some leverage over Trump, which most people don't realise. She's not just a secondary partner,"" Sabatini says.
""It's more of an equal partnership than Trump would like.""
Splits within the US administration itself could also have strengthened Rodríguez's hand. Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, has an explicit anti-communist agenda and is believed to want to see her government overthrown.
""Rubio… regularly speaks to the opposition, who are unhappy. There are rumblings of discontent,"" says Sabatini. ""Rubio and others will push for early elections but it's up to her when they are held.""
And the better things are in Venezuela, the more likely she is to call the elections. ""She wants to wait to see the economy lifted so she could potentially run and win,"" Sabatini adds.
Indeed, this pragmatism runs through Rodríguez's political DNA. ""Chavismo is pragmatic. Its main objective is to survive, and maintain power and wealth,"" says Phil Gunson.
As Ana Milagros Parra says: ""They bend so as not to break.""
And it seems that this means that even up against the might of Trump, Rodríguez is not completely without power.

Eight skiers found dead after California avalanche,2026-02-19T12:55:38.261Z," Brandon Drenon
","Rescue teams combing through the backcountry of California's Lake Tahoe region say they have found the bodies of eight skiers who went missing in an avalanche on Tuesday.
The search for a final missing skier continues but that person is presumed dead, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Officials said one of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts ""challenging emotionally"".
Fifteen skiers were reported missing on Tuesday after a ""football-field"" sized avalanche came barrelling down in the Castle Peak area around 11:30 local time (19:30 GMT). Six have been rescued.
""I want to offer my condolences to the family in this very trying time,"" Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said on Wednesday.
The bodies of the eight dead skiers were still trapped in the snow and could not yet be recovered due to ""pretty horrific"" conditions, officials said.
Since the avalanche, another 3ft (90cm) of snow has fallen on the area, Tahoe National Forest supervisor Chris Feutrier said.
""The hazard remains high,"" he said.
Once the bodies are recovered, they will be transported to the Placer County morgue.
Families of the deceased have been notified. Authorities have not yet released any of their names.
Officials say the victims are seven women and two men.
Sugar Bowl Academy, a ski school in Placer County, California, said multiple members of its community had died in the avalanche.
""Emergency responders are still working to recover all of the victims and are not at this time sharing the personal details of the victims and the survivors out of respect for the families affected,"" the academy said.
""We are an incredibly close and connected community,"" executive director Stephen McMahon said. ""This tragedy has affected each and every one of us. The depth of support for the families whose lives have been changed forever reminds us of how special this community is.""
Sheriff Woo said the rescue operation was a joint effort involving two teams and roughly 50 crew members who had to traverse ""extreme weather conditions"" using specialised equipment.
At 17:30 local time on Tuesday, search teams arrived to an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.
Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and ""could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche"", Sheriff Moon said. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tour.
The entire ski group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.
The avalanche on Tuesday occurred as they were making their way back at the end of a three-day trip.
California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that state authorities were ""co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort"" with local emergency teams.
Conditions on Wednesday remained dangerous, multiple officials said, with Woo describing the climate as ""treacherous"".
""Avoid the backcountry,"" he said. ""Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home.""
The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a destructive potential scale of D1 to D5, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center, which would mean it was over half a mile in length and would have a deposit of around 6.5ft.
The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported over 30in of snowfall since Tuesday.
The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.
The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.

What we know about the abduction of Savannah Guthrie's mother Nancy,2026-02-19T12:11:19.895Z," Brandon DrenonandGrace Eliza Goodwin
","Mystery surrounds the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of NBC News anchor Savannah Guthrie.
She disappeared from her home in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, on 31 January. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.
The Guthrie family has made several public pleas for her safe return, and has asked for proof that she is still alive.
Investigators analysed DNA from a glove that was found during their search, but it produced no matches, officials said.
They are also studying a series of apparent ransom notes that may have been sent from the person or people behind the alleged crime.
Guthrie was last seen at her home in Catalina Foothills, an affluent neighbourhood roughly six miles (10km) north-east of Tucson, on 31 January evening, when family members dropped her off around 21:30 local time (04:30 GMT).
At 01:47 local time on 1 February, a doorbell camera to her home was disconnected and removed.
At 02:28, the app on Guthrie's pacemaker, an implanted cardiac device, disconnected from her phone.
Concern grew when members of her church noticed her absence at Sunday's service and notified her family.
After the family called 911, authorities began a search that soon included volunteers and federal officers from Border Patrol, which stretched into the next morning.
Officials warned that Guthrie may be in dire health without her medication. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said she was ""not in good physical health"", but had no reported cognitive issues.
Police also say they found blood on the floor of Guthrie's porch - which was confirmed to be hers.
Officials have released doorbell-camera videos and images showing a masked and armed suspect on Guthrie's doorstep the night she disappeared.
The footage showed the suspect - who the FBI said appears to be a male between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) - covering a camera lens with some plants.
He was wearing a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack, the FBI added.
The man's clothes are believed to have been bought at Walmart, according to Nanos, the Pima County sheriff. Nanos told the BBC's US partner CBS News that investigators had been reviewing surveillance video from nearby Walmart outlets.
The sheriff has also told CBS that investigators have not ruled out a theory that an accomplice was also involved in the suspected abduction.
Nanos has said that ""all siblings and spouses"" in the Guthrie family have been cleared as possible suspects in the case.
Investigators have found 16 gloves during their search - most of which are thought to have been discarded by people searching for Guthrie.
However, DNA evidence collected from one glove, found approximately two miles from Guthrie's home, was sent to a lab for testing.
""The one [glove] with the DNA profile recovered is different and appears to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video,"" the FBI said.
But officials later said the DNA produced no matches in Codis, the FBI's database of DNA from offenders. Sheriff Nanos told the BBC he still believed the DNA could play a role in the case.
""I just believe she's somewhere here locally,"" he added. ""I don't know why.""
Officials have also found DNA at Guthrie's address that does not belong to her or anyone close to her.
On 10 February, police detained a man in connection with the suspected abduction, before releasing him hours later.
After his release, a man, identified only as Carlos, told reporters outside his home that he did not know who Nancy Guthrie was. ""I hope they get the suspect, because I'm not it,"" he said, according to footage posted by reporters on social media.
Officers also searched a nearby home on 13 February and questioned a person during a traffic stop, but no arrests were made.
The department did not provide further details about the lead or the residents of the house, saying only that no one was arrested.
The FBI is offering a reward of $100,000 (£72,000) for information that leads to an arrest. It says it has received more than 13,000 tips from the public since Guthrie's disappearance.
President Donald Trump, who ordered federal authorities to help in the investigation, has called the case ""very unusual"".
A number of possible ransom notes have been reviewed by investigators, some of which were first sent to media outlets.
Authorities have not said that any of these has been verified as having been sent by Guthrie's suspected abductor.
At least one of them has been determined by the FBI to be fake, which led to the arrest of a man in California.
One of the possible notes was said by FBI Special Agent Heith Janke to have set a deadline for a multimillion-dollar sum to be paid in bitcoin by 5 February, or a higher figure to be paid by 9 February.
On 6 February, authorities said they were investigating a new message. They did not say who received the note or provide any details about what it said.
In several emotional videos, Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have commented on the alleged ransom notes and pleaded for their mother's safe return.
On 4 February, Savannah said ""we are ready to talk"", telling the abductor or abductors directly that ""we need to know without a doubt that she is alive and you have her"".
In a separate video the following day, her brother Camron said the family still had not received any contact from ""whoever is out there holding our mother"".
In another video on 6 February, the family released a third video in which Savannah Guthrie said: ""We received your message, and we understand. We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her.""
She added: ""And we will pay.""
Further video updates have followed, including one that was shared on 12 February that showed images of a young Nancy with her children.
Two weeks after her mother went missing, Savannah made another direct appeal to the person or persons who may have taken her mother, saying: ""It is never too late to do the right thing.""
Savannah Guthrie, 54, is an American broadcast journalist who has served as the co-anchor of NBC News' Today since 2012. She is also the network's chief legal correspondent and a primary anchor for its election coverage. Previously, she was NBC News' White House correspondent.

Billionaire Les Wexner tells US lawmakers he was 'naive' and 'conned' by Epstein,2026-02-19T11:01:07.310Z," Ana Faguy
","US billionaire Les Wexner, who is alleged to have played a key role in helping Jeffrey Epstein build his wealth, has described himself as ""naive, foolish and gullible"" for trusting the late sex offender.
In a statement to US lawmakers at the start of a closed-door deposition on Wednesday, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret lingerie brand accused Epstein of stealing ""vast sums"" of money from his family when working as his financial adviser.
Wexner, who was testifying before a House committee as part of its probe into the Epstein case, has denied any wrongdoing.
He was described as a potential co-conspirator of Epstein's in a 2019 FBI document, but no charges were ever brought against him.
Lawmakers accused the billionaire, who gave Epstein broad powers over his finances, of knowing about the other man's crimes but failing to stop them.
Wexner had been called before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee to answer questions surrounding his relationship with Epstein in the wake of the release of thousands of documents related to the financier's wrongdoing.
Members of the committee travelled to Wexner's home state of Ohio for the testimony.
A spokesperson for the 88-year-old tycoon told the BBC: ""Mr Wexner honestly answered every question put to him today by the Committee.
""Mr Wexner reiterated that he has no knowledge of, and did not participate in, Epstein's illegal conduct. He stands by that fervently.""
Only Democratic lawmakers attended the deposition. No Republican lawmakers travelled for it, though some of their staff members did attend.
The Democrats addressed reporters after the session.
""We should be very clear that there would be no Epstein island, there'd be no Epstein plane, there'd be no money to traffic women and girls, Mr Epstein would not be the wealthy man he was, without the support of Les Wexner,"" congressman Robert Garcia, of California, said.
Although Wexner gave his testimony behind closed doors, his opening statement was made public.
In the statement, Wexner said his relationship with Epstein was limited, and denied any knowledge of the convicted sex offender's abuse.
""I was naive, foolish and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,"" he said. ""He was a conman. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.""
He said he was ""pleased to testify"" and wanted ""to set the record straight"".
Wexner also said he had visited Epstein's private island for ""a few hours"" with his family.
The pair's relationship dates back to the 1980s and Wexner has said he cut ties after Epstein was accused of sexually abusing children in Florida.
Wexner has also said he later discovered Epstein ""had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family"" - a statement he repeated in his opening remarks on Wednesday.
The retail magnate was identified in a 2019 FBI document as a potential co-conspirator. A separate email also said there was ""limited evidence regarding his involvement"".
Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche previously said Wexner's name ""appears in the files thousands of times"".
Wexner's lawyers recently told the BBC: ""The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.
""Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.""

Trump adviser calls for Fed economists to be 'disciplined',2026-02-18T21:45:01.149Z," Danielle Kaye
Business reporter
","One of Donald Trump's most senior economic advisers has said a group of economists should be ""disciplined"" for a Federal Reserve study which argued that US firms and consumers have borne the brunt of the president's tariffs.
National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the report, published by the New York Federal Reserve, was ""an embarrassment"" and ""the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system"".
It found that last year, 90% of the cost of increased tariffs was paid for by US companies and shoppers.
Hassett's comments to CNBC are the latest attack by the Trump administration on the Federal Reserve which have, until now, been focused on interest rates.
The paper by the New York Fed was released as the US Supreme Court weighs a legal challenge to Trump's sweeping global tariffs.
US firms and consumers continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025.""
Hassett, who is director of the National Economic Council, said that prices had fallen, inflation was lower and ""real wages were up $1,400 on average last year, which means that consumers were made better off by the tariffs"".
He told CNBC: ""The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.""
The New York Fed declined to comment.
Its findings align with other recent tariff analyses. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, an independent research firm in Germany, said in a report last month that it had found ""near-complete pass-through of tariffs to US import prices"".
The National Bureau of Economic Research also found that the pass-through of tariffs was ""almost 100%"", meaning the US - not the countries exporting goods to America - is paying for the increase in prices.
In recent months, Trump has repeatedly bemoaned the legal battle over his trade strategy. The small businesses and US states challenging his administration's tariffs claim that the president has overstepped his authority.
The Supreme Court could rule on the case as soon as this Friday.
The US central bank, which sets interest rates, has been under pressure from Trump to lower borrowing costs more aggressively.
Federal prosecutors recently opened a criminal investigation over testimony the central bank's chair, Jerome Powell, gave to the Senate about renovations to Fed buildings.
The president has also taken aim at Fed governor Lisa Cook, whom he wants to remove.
The Fed has been monitoring the effects of tariffs on inflation. Officials voted to hold interest rates steady at their meeting in January, citing signs of stabilisation in the labour market.
At the same time, inflation in the US cooled last month, according to the Department of Labor, as prices for energy and used cars fell.
The retreat could add fuel to arguments by Trump and others that the Fed was in a position to cut interest rates without stoking a new flare-up in prices.
But some analysts have warned that further progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target could stall in the months ahead if companies start to pass on the costs of tariffs more fully to consumers.
Minutes from the Fed's January meeting, released on Wednesday, underscored division among Fed officials as to the path forward for interest rates this year.
Some even cautioned about a risk of rate hikes if inflationary pressures persist.

Canada Conservative leader dismisses MP's 'hissy fit' remark over US relations,2026-02-18T20:52:20.424Z," Nadine Yousif
Senior Canada reporter
","Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said he does not agree with an elected member of his party who claimed that Canada was harming its relationship with the US by throwing an ""anti-American hissy fit"".
Jamil Jivani, a Conservative MP from Ontario, made the remark in an interview with right-wing American news outlet Breitbart over the weekend.
On Tuesday, Poilievre distanced himself from Jivani's comment, telling reporters that the MP does not speak for his party.
Jivani spoke to Breitbart after he travelled to Washington earlier this month on a trip that was not sanctioned by the Canadian government, and where he had an unofficial meeting with US Vice-President JD Vance.
Vance and Jivani are longtime friends and were former roommates at Yale University, where both attended law school.
Ahead of his trip, Jivani said in a video post on X that he was going to Washington to help Prime Minister Mark Carney negotiate a trade deal with the US.
On Saturday, the Conservative MP told Breitbart that Canadians ""are shooting ourselves in the foot if we continue this anti-America… hissy fit"".
Anti-US sentiments have grown in Canada in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs on key Canadian sectors and his comments on Canada being the ""51st state"".
Carney, a Liberal, successfully campaigned on taking a defiant stance in response to Trump by diversifying trade and reducing Canada's reliance on the US.
Speaking about Jivani's trip, Poilievre said he believes it is ""necessary"" for all MPs to use their connections to advance trade talks in an effort to overturn US tariffs on Canada.
But he added he did not agree with Jivani's comments to Breitbart.
""Canadians are legitimately upset by the unjustifiable tariffs and the comments that the president has made,"" Poilievre told reporters.
""He speaks for himself, and I speak for the party,"" Poilievre said.
Jivani has said that he had ""productive meetings"" with the White House and the state department during his trip.
""The President asked me to pass along a message: 'Tell the Canadians I love them,"" Jivani said in a post on X on 4 February.
At the time, Carney told reporters that Jivani was briefed on the file by the minister of Canada-US trade, Dominic LeBlanc. But the prime minister noted that Jivani was not in Washington on an official capacity.
Jivani represents the Ontario constituency of Bowmanville-Oshawa North, which includes many auto workers affected by US tariffs.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who has been vocal against Trump's tariffs on his province's auto sector, also criticised Jivani's remarks to Breitbart.
""I am happy that he went down in the US, I'm happy when I see other premiers go down to the US and lobby,"" Ford told reporters on Tuesday. ""But no, I don't call it a hissy fit"".
Canada remains subject to sector-specific tariffs by the Trump administration, as well as a blanket 35% tariff rate on goods not covered by a longstanding free trade agreement between the two countries and Mexico.
That free trade agreement is now up for a scheduled review that is set to conclude later this year.

Third Conservative Canadian MP defects to Carney's Liberals,2026-02-18T19:10:13.126Z," Nadine Yousif
Senior Canada reporter
","A Conservative member of parliament from Alberta has defected to the Liberal Party, bringing Prime Minister Mark Carney closer to a majority in the House of Commons.
In a post on social media, Carney announced that Matt Jeneroux, who represents a constituency in Edmonton, has joined the Liberal caucus — the third Conservative to do so in recent months.
With the addition of Jeneroux, the Liberals now have 169 seats, putting them just three shy of the required 172 for majority.
Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre accused the prime minister of trying to seize a majority ""through dirty backroom deals"".
Two other Conservative MPs, Chris d'Entremont of Nova Scotia and Michael Ma of Ontario, had crossed the floor late last year to join Carney's government.
There are currently three vacant seats in Canada's parliament: two Toronto-area seats, following the resignations of Liberal MPs Chrystia Freeland and Bill Blair, and one Montreal-area seat that was closely contested by one vote, forcing a pending by-election.
Conservatives accuse Canada's Carney of being 'undemocratic' as MP resigns
Canada's Poilievre sweeps Conservative party leadership test with 87.4%
Jeneroux had been representing the Conservatives in Edmonton since 2015 and was elected to the House of Commons in three consecutive elections, making his defection a noteworthy loss for the opposition party.
On Wednesday, he said he made the decision to cross the floor ""after further reflection"" with his family over the holidays, and ""conversations with colleagues and constituents"".
After meeting Carney in Edmonton on Monday morning, Jeneroux told reporters that the prime minister's speech at the World Economic Forum last month is what ultimately swayed his decision to join the Liberals.
""It opened a lot of eyes for Canadians, Albertans and Edmontonians,"" he said.
In that speech, Carney had urged middle powers to come together and reject economic coercion by ""great powers"".
The speech did not mention US President Donald Trump by name, but was widely interpreted as being aimed at policies of the current Trump administration.
Jeneroux had previously announced his intention to resign from the Conservative caucus in November, saying that he wanted to spend more time with family. At the time he did not mention defecting to the Liberals.
In a statement then, he said he ran in the 2025 federal election with hopes the Conservatives would form government, and that he ""wanted desperately to play a role in that vision"".
Carney hailed Jeneroux as a ""strong voice in international engagement and parliamentary diplomacy"" and said he will service as a ""new special advisor on economic and security partnerships"".
""Building a stronger, more resilient, and more independent country will require ambition, collaboration, and occasionally, sacrifice,"" Carney wrote. ""I am grateful to Matt and his family that he will continue his service as a strong voice for Edmonton Riverbend in Parliament.""
The latest defection comes a few weeks after the Conservative party voted overwhelmingly to keep Poilievre on as leader, despite his personal unpopularity in the polls.
Both Ma and d'Entremont had cited Poilievre's leadership as a reason why they chose to leave the party. Late last year, d'Entremont claimed that others in his party ""are in the same boat"".
In a post on social media on Wednesday, Poilievre said Conservatives would ""continue our fight for a Canada that's affordable, safe, and self-reliant"".
""Mark Carney is trying to seize a costly Liberal majority government that Canadians voted against in the last election through dirty backroom deals,"" he wrote. ""Matt Jeneroux has betrayed the people of Edmonton Riverbend who voted for affordable food and homes, safe streets, and a strong resource sector.""

Air Force One set for makeover paint job with new colours,2026-02-18T17:17:56.591Z," Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu
","The US presidential jet is getting a new paint design that will include one of President Donald Trump's preferred colour choices for the White House and his hotels, gold.
Air Force One and other planes used by high level US officials, including First Lady Melania Trump, are being repainted gold, deep red and navy blue as they undergo scheduled repairs and maintenance, according to the US Air Force.
The colours will also feature on a new luxury 747-8i Boeing plane donated to the presidential fleet by Qatar, an Air Force spokesperson told CBS.
The white, blue and robin's egg blue associated with the presidential jet have been in use since the 1960s, when John F Kennedy was president.
Trump has called for updates to the executive fleet since his first term. His successor, former President Joe Biden, cancelled a broad makeover Trump had initially planned.
The new colours have already been spotted on model aircraft seen at the White House, where Trump is also making his aesthetic imprint, from the large-scale plans for a new ballroom to the more subtle installation of signs in a curling font in gold.
The private plane Trump travelled on during his 2024 campaign, sometimes called ""Trump Force One"", used the same colour palette that will be given to the presidential fleet.
While it is not clear how much the paint jobs will cost, the US Air Force, which operates the executive planes, said in a statement to the BBC that the new colour requirements were ""not expected to result in additional delays or costs to the program.""
It added that it was implementing the new colour scheme on the Boeing VC-25B (a variation of the Boeing 747) currently used to transport the president, as well as four C-32 jets often used as ""Air Force Two"" for the vice-president, and the jet donated by Qatar. Painting has been completed on of the C-32 aircraft.
Preparations began last summer for the Pentagon to refit the Qatari jumbo jet that is expected to serve as Air Force One. The Boeing aircraft - valued at $400m (£300m) - was donated by Qatar as an ""unconditional"" gift, with any necessary retrofitting costs being borne by the US government.
While any plane where the president is a passenger is called ""Air Force One"", the holder of the highest office in the country most often flies on a specialised jet that includes an office, a bedroom suite, two kitchen galleys that can prepare 100 meals, office space and a medical facility, according to Boeing.

'A sad day' - curling cheating row at Winter Games unsettles Canadians,2026-02-18T15:59:34.491Z," Ana Faguy
Washington DCandEloise Alanna
Montreal
","A scandal at the Winter Olympics has left the Canadian curling teams on the defensive and Canadians reeling over the crack in their country's polite persona.
Over the weekend, Canadian curler Marc Kennedy had an expletive-filled outburst after Sweden accused him of cheating during a match, and later said his team might be the target of a ""premeditated"" attack by their rivals.
Kennedy was accused of double-touching the curling stone, by making contact with the granite part of the stone with his finger after releasing it down the ice.
The next day, Canadian women's captain Rachel Homan was accused of the same thing.
Both have denied the accusations, but Canada's curling teams, who historically have dominated the sport, now face questions over their tactics.
While the curlers have shown their anger over the situation during matches, fans of the sport and Canadians have questioned whether the team acted in the spirit of curling.
In a country well known for its ""niceness"", the cheating row has stung for some. The BBC asked tourists and locals in Montreal what they made of it.
""It's a sad day for Canadian sport,"" said Tim Gray, from Alberta. ""Integrity in the sport is important, even if you have to call it on yourself.""
""As Canadians, we aren't supposed to do these things,"" said Samar, from Ontario.
Without sportsmanship, said Dwayne from British Columbia, it's not sport any more.
There was a more nuanced take at the Royal Montreal Curling Club.
One of the curling instructors, Ankara Leonard, said the publicity could be good for the sport by generating interest.
She added: ""Do I think [Kennedy's] finger affects the rock? No I do not. Do I think we have to play within the rules? Yes.""
The controversy began on Friday when Swedish player Oskar Eriksson accused Kennedy of touching both the handle of the curling stone and the granite.
As the game continued, Kennedy and Eriksson got into a verbal back-and-forth that included expletives.
Their exchange quickly went viral as a video emerged that appeared to show Kennedy pushing the stone with his finger after releasing it.
Kennedy later said the Swedish team had asked officials ""to make sure we weren't double touching"".
Touching the handle of the curling stone multiple times is allowed, as long as it does not take place beyond a boundary known as the hog line.
But the Swedes' grievance seems to have been that the second touch by Kennedy appeared to involve him making contact with the granite part of the curling stone with his finger.
This incident, and the later controversies, led World Curling to clarify the rules of the sport. ""During forward motion, touching the granite of the stone is not allowed. This will result in the stone being removed from play,"" they said.
After the match, Kennedy got a verbal warning from World Curling for using foul language, but he was not formally charged with cheating by the governing body.
The next day, Kennedy said: ""I probably could have handled it better. But we're human out there and there's a lot of emotions. I'm not going to apologise for defending my teammates and standing up for myself.""
""I've curled my whole life, never once with the intention of getting an advantage through cheating,"" he added.
An opinion piece in the Canadian news outlet, the Globe and Mail, pointed to some of the frustration felt back home
""These Canadian curling teams are not fun bad guys. They come off like the sort of competitors who need so desperately to win that they will do anything - even things that are pointless - in order to get there.""
Cathal Kelly, the writer of the opinion piece, continued: ""There's an easy way out of this - stop struggling. Stop acting like our curling reputation matters more than our national one. Be the bigger man and woman, even if you don't think you did anything wrong.""
There was a second cheating row on Saturday when match officials accused the Canadian women's team of the same violation by making contact with the granite.
Rachel Homan said there was a ""zero percent chance"" there had truly been a violation, as she and her teammates looked on in frustration. The Canadians lost to the Swiss, 8-7.
On Sunday, Great Britain's men's team was accused of the same violation.
Both Homan and British men's curler Bobby Lammie had stones removed from play due to alleged violations.
Homan later slammed the officials' decision to remove her stone during a defeat to Switzerland, saying it was ""insane"".
World Curling does not use video to review play, but they did send two officials to monitor how players released their stones in subsequent games.
Curling columnist and Olympian Tomi Rantamaki, in an article for The Curling News, warned that Canada's dominance in the world of curling means its players should be mindful of the influence they have.
""Young players in Finland, Korea, Italy, Sweden - everywhere - often copy what Canadian teams do. They copy the athlete's delivery, the sweeping, the tactics, the communication,"" Rantamaki wrote. ""And they copy the behaviour.""
Update 18 February: This article was amended to provide further explanation of the rules regarding double-touching and contact with the granite of the curling stone

Rescuers search for nine missing skiers after California avalanche,2026-02-18T15:29:37.398Z," Max Matza
","Nine backcountry skiers are missing following an avalanche in California's Lake Tahoe region on Tuesday, authorities say.
Six others have been rescued after they became stranded, the Nevada County Sheriff's Office said.
The avalanche was reported about 11:30 PST (19:30 GMT) in the Castle Peak area near the town of Truckee, according to officials. Weather conditions remain dangerous, with a high chance of further avalanches.
""Highly skilled rescue ski teams"" have deployed from two nearby ski resorts, the sheriff said. The six known survivors have been ""directed to shelter in place as best they can in the conditions,"" the sheriff added.
Officials initially reported that a group of 16 people in total - four guides and 12 clients - were involved, though that number was later lowered to 15.
""The six initially reported skiers who survived the avalanche have been successfully rescued this evening,"" the sheriff's office wrote on Facebook late on Tuesday night. Two of the six rescued skiers were taken to hospital, it said.
Experts from the nearby Boreal Mountain Ski Resort and the Alder Creek Adventure Center are also attempting to reach the site.
An earlier statement posted by the sheriff's office said 46 emergency responders had joined the rescue efforts.
The Sierra Avalanche Center wrote in a forecast: ""Large avalanches are expected to occur [on] Tuesday, Tuesday night, and into at least early Wednesday morning across backcountry terrain.""
The avalanche centre listed the danger rating as ""high"" - a four out of five on the rating scale.
""Travel in, near, or below avalanche terrain is not recommended today. A widespread natural avalanche cycle is expected over the next 24 hours,"" the centre said. ""Large avalanches may run through treed areas.""
The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a scale of D1 to D5, Sierra Avalanche Center Forecaster Steve Reynaud told local outlet ABC News 10. D2 avalanches can injure, bury or kill people, according to avalanche.org.
Reynaud told ABC that the skiers were on the last day of a three-day backcountry skiing trip.
He said the skiers spent two nights at huts on a trip that involved navigating ""rugged mountainous terrain"" for 4 miles (6.4km) while carrying food and supplies.
A spokesman for the sheriff's office, Capt Russell Greene, told local news station KCRA-TV that it would be a ""slow, tedious process"" to find the missing skiers because of the high avalanche danger posing a risk to rescuers.
As of around 17:15 PST (01:15 GMT), he said first responders, including some on skis, were still trying to reach the avalanche zone and that those alive were sheltering under tarpaulin sheets ""doing the best they can to survive"".
He said it was not uncommon for ski tour companies to take paying customers out in such conditions, adding: ""I don't think it was a wise choice but we don't know all the details yet.""
California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that state authorities were ""co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort"" with local emergency teams.
The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported 30 inches (76cm) of snowfall in the past 24 hours.
The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.
The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.

Suspect in Rhode Island ice hockey shooting killed ex-wife and son,2026-02-18T04:50:10.847Z," Christal Hayes
","Two victims shot dead at a high school ice hockey game in Rhode Island have been identified as the suspect's ex-wife and son, police said on Tuesday.
Robert Dorgan - who police said also went by the names Roberta Esposito and Roberta Dorgan - was found dead inside the Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket on Monday, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after what authorities said was a targeted attack.
Dorgan's ex-wife, Rhonda Dorgan, and adult son, Aidan Dorgan, died. Rhonda's mother and father along with a family friend were injured. All three were in a critical condition at hospital.
Police have not given a motive, but said it appeared to be a family dispute.
Video of the incident showed shots fired while players were on the rink, sparking panic as the teams scrambled to leave the arena, which is located a few miles from the state capital of Providence.
Asked at a news conference on Tuesday if the shooting followed a confrontation, Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said no.
She said two guns recovered from the scene - a Glock 10mm pistol and a SIG Sauer P226 - were legally owned.
Goncalves told reporters a bystander ""stepped in and interjected"" and ""that's probably what led to a swift end of this tragic event"".
Court documents show that Rhonda Dorgan filed for divorce from Robert Dorgan, 56, in February 2020.
In the petition she wrote ""gender reassignment surgery, narcissistic + personality disorder traits"" as grounds for their divorce. Those words appear to have been crossed out and replaced with ""irreconcilable differences"".
That same month, the shooter filed a police report asking authorities to file charges against the father-in-law, alleging he had threatened to have Dorgan killed.
Dorgan's father-in-law was alleged to have used a derogatory term for transgender people, and police filed a criminal charge against him which was later dismissed.
The police chief said officers were combing through thousands of the suspect's social media posts, but added that Dorgan's gender identity was ""irrelevant to the investigation at this point"".
""What I can tell you is the identification was in the name of Robert and then we also know that the suspect went by the name Roberta,"" said Gonclaves on Tuesday.
""It appeared that the suspect was in female clothes yesterday, but again, that's nothing that had swayed the investigation, one way or another.""
A family statement posted for an online fundraiser said: ""Our family has been forever changed by the tragic events at Lynch Arena.""
It added: ""In addition to this unimaginable loss, their grandparents are currently in critical condition, fighting for their lives.""
General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, a naval contractor based in Bath, Maine, confirmed that Dorgan was one of its employees.
The company said in a statement: ""We extend our deepest sympathies to the victims, their families, and all those affected by this tragedy.""
Authorities have spoken to dozens of witnesses to the attack. Many families were watching the game and ran in fear as gunfire broke out.
Melissa Dunn, whose son played for one of the hockey teams, said she saw paramedics performing CPR in the stands of the arena after she ran back inside to find her son.
""You don't know what's going on at first,"" Dunn said. ""You just hear the loud noises. And we're used to the kids banging on the board with their skates, so we thought it was that at first.""
She said she screamed for her son to duck and avoid gunfire.
""We ran out of the rink… your first thought is 'where's my kid?'"" she said.
""I tried to get back in the rink, and I actually got back in there to find out where he was, and I saw them doing CPR in the stands and it was just really disturbing.""

"No DNA matches on glove found in Nancy Guthrie case, police say",2026-02-18T04:32:16.496Z," Sakshi VenkatramanandDavid Willis
North America correspondent
","A glove discovered as part of the investigation into Nancy Guthrie's kidnapping has produced no DNA matches, say authorities in Pima County, Arizona.
Found about two miles (3.2km) from Guthrie's home, the glove appeared to match one worn by a suspect in doorbell-camera footage taken the night she disappeared.
DNA from the glove was sent for testing on Thursday but produced no matches in Codis, the FBI's database of DNA from offenders. However, the local sheriff told the BBC that said DNA may still play a role in finding Guthrie.
Nancy Guthrie, mother of NBC television anchor Savannah Guthrie, has been missing since 1 February, when officials say she was taken from home against her will.
The family have made repeated pleas for the return of the 84-year-old.
In his comments to the BBC, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said he believed Guthrie was the victim of a targeted kidnapping, and that she was being held somewhere close to her home in Tucson.
Nanos, who is leading the hunt, said he was confident they would find her - whether it took ""10 days, 10 months, or worse"".
Detectives have received close to 40,000 tips from the public, he added.
Nanos said he did not see the lack of DNA matches as a setback, and added that DNA could still play a crucial part in solving the case.
The glove was just one of several that were collected from various locations near Guthrie's residence, though most turned out to have been discarded by people searching for the missing woman.
Last week, investigators released video footage taken from a doorbell camera at Guthrie's front door that showed a masked man wearing gloves and a backpack.
In the video, the suspect walks toward the camera and tries to cover it with his gloved hand before grabbing some brush from the front yard to block the camera's view.
After conducting a forensic analysis of the video, the FBI said it believed the man was between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall, with an average build.
The sheriff's department said it was working with Walmart to determine who purchased a backpack worn by the suspect in the video, which is exclusively sold at the store.
More than two weeks since Guthrie, 84, was reported missing, no arrests have been made, the sheriff's department confirmed on Tuesday.
However, authorities noted that more DNA found at her home was being analysed - and that they are exploring other ""investigative genetic genealogy"" databases for DNA matches.
Police said over the weekend that the Guthrie family, including Nancy Guthrie's children and their spouses, were not suspects in her abduction.
Nanos described Guthrie's children and the rest of her family instead as ""victims"" in the disappearance.
Guthrie's three children have posted multiple videos online pleading for their mother's safe return in the two weeks since her disappearance, saying they were willing to pay her abductors.
Over the weekend, Savannah Guthrie posted another such video that addressed a potential kidnapper directly.
""It is never too late to do the right thing,"" she said. ""We are here and... we believe in the essential goodness of every human being.""
Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when a family member dropped her off at her home following a get-together at her daughter Annie Guthrie's house.
Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.
A massive search team mounted by both local police and the FBI have since been combing through Guthrie's home and the surrounding area.
Officials have warned that Guthrie needs regular medication and is ""not in good physical health"". They have said she has no reported cognitive issues.
Police have also found blood on the floor of Guthrie's porch that was confirmed to be hers.
The FBI has increased the reward for information about her disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.

On Monday night's show, Colbert said that CBS would not show his interview with Texas lawmaker James Talarico out of concerns about a response from the FCC, which has new guidance on equal airtime for political candidates.
""We were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,"" he said.
""Then, then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this.""
Colbert, host of The Late Show, went on to explain that new FCC guidance on the ""equal time"" rule - which requires certain TV and radio broadcasters to give equal time to rival political candidates - could have created legal trouble for the network, according to CBS lawyers.
The FCC regulates radio, TV and satellite airwaves, giving it power over a range of matters, including mergers and decency complaints.
CBS flatly denied Colbert's claims in a statement on Tuesday.
""The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep James Talarico,"" the network said.
Talarico, 36, is a Democratic candidate for a US Senate seat in Texas.
CBS added in a statement: ""The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates... and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.
""The Late Show decided to present the interview through its YouTube channel with on-air promotion on the broadcast rather than potentially providing the equal-time options.""
The full interview was later posted on YouTube, where FCC rules do not apply.
News content has traditionally been exempted from the ""equal time"" rule.
But the FCC has said the rule may soon apply to late-night programmes like Colbert's. It may also apply to political radio programmes, which tend to have more conservative hosts and listeners.
After issuing the new guidance in January, Brendan Carr, the FCC chairman known for taking an expansive view of his power, said on X that ""for years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late-night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programmes - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes.
""Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.""
US President Donald Trump has at times said he is considering pulling the FCC licence for several US networks that he says have aired views critical of his presidency.
Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, agreed in July to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute with Trump regarding an interview it broadcast on CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris.
Business commentators have questioned whether the deal was made partly so as to not affect Paramount's planned merger with Skydance Media, which Trump had the power to halt.
CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.
Anna Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC board, condemned the response by CBS, saying Colbert and the network had the First Amendment constitutional right to free speech.
""This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech,"" she said in a statement, adding that the FCC had ""no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes"".
She continued: ""It is no secret that Paramount, CBS's parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content.""
She has previously accused the FCC's Republican leaders of using the equal-time rule to unfairly penalise critics in violation of the constitutional right to free speech.
The Late Show is due to end its 33-year run in May. Colbert has been the host since 2015.

US Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin to leave post,2026-02-17T22:34:14.339Z," Max Matza
","Spokeswoman for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Tricia McLaughlin - one of the most prominent figures in the White House crackdown on immigration - plans to leave her post this week.
Mclaughlin has vigorously promoted and defended President Donald Trump's deportation push across social media and in press interviews and podcasts.
She had made plans in December to leave, but chose to stay on after two US citizens were fatally shot during confrontations with immigration officers in Minnesota last month, sources told CBS, the BBC's US partner.
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed McLaughlin's departure, saying she ""has served with exceptional dedication, tenacity, and professionalism"".
""She has played an instrumental role in advancing our mission to secure the homeland and keep Americans safe,"" said Noem.
""While we are sad to see her leave, we are grateful for her service and wish Tricia nothing but success.""
At the DHS, McLaughlin has often been the face of two agencies that fall under the department - Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection.
Republican commentators largely praised her after the announcement of her departure, posting on social media that she had been one of the fiercest fighters for and best defenders of the Trump administration's policies.
Democrats, meanwhile, criticised her tenure, with Democratic National Committee spokesperson Kendall Witmer saying in a statement that she had ""defended even the most violent tactics"" used in the immigration crackdown.
McLaughlin will leave the department at a tense moment.
Republican and Democratic lawmakers are currently in a standoff over the budget for DHS, as Democrats demand it make changes to how ICE operates, and the department's funding was shut off on Saturday. Lawmakers are not expected to agree a new funding measure until the end of the month, at the earliest.
Meanwhile, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests Americans are growing unhappy with Trump's handling of immigration. In a poll conducted from 13 February to 16 Febuary, 55% of respondents disapproved of Trump's immigration policies, compared to 44% a year ago.
McLaughlin's next move after leaving the post is unclear. According to CBS, she is to be replaced by Katie Zacharia, a commentator who has appeared on Fox News.
McLaughlin served in the first Trump administration at the Treasury Department. She later became a spokeswoman for Vivek Ramaswamy's campaign to become the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election.

US civil rights leader Jesse Jackson dies aged 84,2026-02-17T18:55:33.254Z,No Author Listed,"US civil rights leader Jesse Jackson died aged 84 on Tuesday morning surrounded by relatives, according to a statement released by his family.
""It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Civil Rights leader and founder of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the Honorable Reverend Jesse Louis Jackson, Sr,"" the family said, adding that he died ""peacefully"".
The cause of his death has not been released, but Jackson had been diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and was in hospital late last year.
Tributes poured in for the prominent activist, who twice ran to be the Democratic presidential nominee, including from the first black US president, Barack Obama.
Jackson is survived by his wife Jacqueline and their children: Santita, Jesse Jr, Jonathan, Yusef, Jacqueline and Ashley.
Jackson's family said in their statement that his ""unwavering commitment to justice, equality and human rights helped shape a global movement for freedom and dignity"".
""A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless from his presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilising millions to register to vote - leaving an indelible mark on history,"" they added.
Alongside working with Martin Luther King Jr and running for president in 1984 and 1988, Jackson is remembered as the founder of a non-profit organisation focused on social justice and civil rights, the Rainbow PUSH coalition.
Calling Jackson a ""true giant"", Obama said in a statement that Jackson's ""two historic runs for president"" had ""laid the foundation for my own campaign to the highest office of the land"".
Obama added that his wife Michelle ""got her first glimpse of political organising at the Jacksons' kitchen table when she was a teenager"".
""For more than 60 years, Reverend Jackson helped lead some of the most significant movements for change in human history,"" the Obamas also said.
""From organising boycotts and sit-ins, to registering millions of voters, to advocating for freedom and democracy around the world, he was relentless in his belief that we are all children of God, deserving of dignity and respect.""
Jackson was admitted to hospital last November, and doctors said he had been diagnosed with a rare degenerative condition called PSP in April 2025, revising an earlier diagnosis of Parkinson's disease that Jackson had said was made in 2015.
Both diseases affect the brain, nervous system and muscle control. Many people with PSP are initially diagnosed with Parkinson's because a number of the symptoms overlap, according to the American Parkinson Disease Association and the group CurePSP.
Born in 1941 in Greenville, South Carolina, Jackson became involved in politics at an early age. He rose to prominence in the 1960s as a leader in Martin Luther King Jr's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was with King when he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee in 1968.
Over the course of his career, Jackson built a movement to bring America's increasingly diverse population together, with a message that centred on poor and working-class Americans.
After his presidential runs, Jackson later positioned himself as an elder statesman within the Democratic Party.
His son Jesse Jackson Jr is a former US congressman.
Shortly after his death was announced, politicians and other public figures took to social media to mourn the loss of Jackson.
US President Donald Trump said he knew Jackson ""long before becoming president"".
""He was a good man, with lots of personality, grit, and 'street smarts,'"" Trump said. ""He was very gregarious - Someone who truly loved people!""
Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, a former secretary of state, also shared tributes, saying they were friends with Jackson for ""almost 50 years"".
""Reverend Jackson championed human dignity and helped create opportunities for countless people to live better lives,"" they said.
House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote on X that Jackson ""was a legendary voice for the voiceless"".
The Democrat added: ""For decades, while labouring in the vineyards of the community, he inspired us to keep hope alive in the struggle for liberty and justice for all.""
New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the civil rights leader ""never stopped demanding that America live up to its promise"".
""He marched, he ran, he organised and he preached justice without apology,"" Mamdani said.
King's daughter Bernice said Jackson had ""devoted his life to lifting people in poverty, the marginalised, and those pushed to society's edges"".
Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, who worked closely with Jackson during the civil rights movement, said Jackson was a ""consequential and transformative leader who changed this nation and the world"".
""He told us we were somebody and made us believe. I will always cherish him taking me under his wing, and I will forever try to do my part to keep hope alive,"" Sharpton said.

Police identify suspect in Rhode Island ice rink shooting,2026-02-17T15:47:53.426Z,No Author Listed,"Police have identified the suspect in a shooting at a high school ice hockey game in Rhode Island that killed two people and injured three others.
Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said Robert Dorgan, who also used the name Roberta and the surname Esposito, died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the Dennis M Lynch Arena on Sunday.
""It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,"" Goncalves said. She did not provide details about the identity of the victims.
Video of the incident showed shots were fired while players were on the rink, sparking panic as the teams scrambled to leave the arena.
Goncalves said a bystander ""stepped in and interjected"" and ""that's probably what led to a swift end of this tragic event"".
After the incident, hockey players and their families described their fear after gunfire broke out.
Melissa Dunn, whose son played for one of the hockey teams, said she saw paramedics performing CPR in the stands of the arena after she ran back inside to find her son.
""You don't know what's going on at first,"" Dunn said. ""You just hear the loud noises. And we're used to the kids banging on the board with their skates, so we thought it was that at first.""
She said she screamed for her son to duck and avoid gunfire.
""We ran out of the rink… your first thought is 'where's my kid?'"" she said. ""I tried to get back in the rink, and I actually got back in there to find out where he was, and I saw them doing CPR in the stands and it was just really disturbing.""
Olin Lawrence, a high school hockey player who was on the ice at the time of the shooting, told reporters he ran inside the locker room when he heard shots being fired.
""I went down and then I ran,"" he said. ""We pressed against the door and just tried to stay safe down in there. It was very scary. We were very nervous. It was a lot of shots.""
The shooting happened at the Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, about five miles (8km) north of the state capital, Providence, and about 45 miles south of Boston.
""Our state is grieving again,"" Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said, referring to a shooting in December at Brown University.
""As governor, a parent and a former coach, my heart breaks for the victims, families and everyone impacted by the devastating shooting at Lynch Arena in Pawtucket.""

"Nancy Guthrie's family cleared as possible suspects, with search in its third week",2026-02-17T12:41:09.269Z," Madeline Halpert
","Police in Arizona say family members of Nancy Guthrie have been cleared as possible suspects, as speculation grows on social media about the whereabouts of the missing 84-year-old mother of NBC anchor Savannah Guthrie.
""The family has been nothing but co-operative and gracious and are victims in this case,"" said the Pima County Sheriff's Office, which has been leading the investigation.
""To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel,"" the office said in a statement.
The Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told NBC News that his office sent out the statement because people had been ""attacking the innocent"".
Nanos told NBC in a text message that ""kindness matters"" and that it was ""every cops duty to stand up and be that voice for our victims"".
The search for Guthrie, who police say went missing on the early hours of 1 February, is now in its third week - and no suspects have been named.
Police have said Guthrie was taken from her home, and that blood was found on the floor of her porch. A video taken from a doorbell camera at Guthrie's residence has shown the man believed to have seized her. He wore a mask, gloves and backpack.
After conducting a forensic analysis of the video, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced last week that it believed the man was between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall, with an average build.
They have also said they believe the suspect bought the mask and backpack at a Walmart and are contacting stores to find a list of people who made the purchases.
Officials have been reviewing surveillance footage from nearby Walmart locations, Nanos has said.
Investigators have also been testing a glove they found that seems to match the ones worn by the suspect.
They have created a DNA profile of an unknown male to put into a national FBI database, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. That database could show a match if the suspect had a previous arrest and gave law enforcement a DNA sample in the past.
On Sunday, Savannah Guthrie, the Today show co-host, issued another video appeal to ""whoever has her, or knows where she is"". She added that Nancy Guthrie's loved ones ""still have hope"".
In the two weeks since Guthrie's disappearance, the FBI and local police have conducted a massive search operation involving helicopters, sniffer dogs and hundreds of officers, while taking in thousands of call-in tips.
On Friday, authorities executed a search warrant at a residence two miles from Guthrie's home but made no arrests.
Investigators are now employing new strategies to try to trace Guthrie. They are using a device that could detect signals coming from her pacemaker, law enforcement sources told CBS.
The sources said the tool, called a ""signal sniffer"", was mounted on a helicopter to fly over an area where officials believe she might be, to track down her exact location.
Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when a family member dropped her off at her home following a get-together at her other daughter Annie Guthrie's house.
Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.

How Jesse Jackson paved way for Barack Obama - and helped change US,2026-02-17T10:04:08.931Z," Anthony Zurcher
North America correspondentandSam Woodhouse
","Jesse Jackson, a key figure during the US civil rights movement of the 1960s, was known for being the first African American to make the jump from activism to major-party presidential politics.
A protege of Martin Luther King Jr, Jackson built a career around working to politically organise and improve the lives of African Americans, and became a national force during his two White House campaigns.
While other African Americans sought the US presidency, Jackson was the first to find significant success at the ballot box – which would pave the way for those who came after, including Barack Obama and Kamala Harris.
Over the course of his career, Jackson built a movement to bring America's increasingly diverse population together, with a message that centred on poor and working-class Americans.
""No one else in the Democratic Party was talking about a multiracial, multi-ethnic democracy,"" Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said at an event in Chicago in August 2024 that celebrated Jackson. ""This movement wasn't just about bringing us together, but about bringing us together around a progressive agenda.""
A gifted orator, Jackson articulated the frustrations of those who felt like second-class citizens in the world's most prosperous democracy. His speech to the 1988 Democratic National Convention, which ended with the refrain ""keep hope alive"", would be echoed decades later in the ""hope and change"" slogan of Obama's successful 2008 presidential campaign.
After his historic run of presidential campaigns, Jackson went on to position himself as an elder statesman within the Democratic Party.
However, Jackson's later years would be punctuated by scandal, including revelations of marital infidelity and financial impropriety involving his son and political heir, Jesse Jackson Jr, who served as a congressman from Illinois.
In 2017, the elder Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and largely withdrew from public life. That diagnosis was subsequently changed to one of progressive supranuclear palsy, a degenerative brain disease with similar symptoms.
Jackson was born Jesse Louis Burns on 8 October 1941 in Greenville, South Carolina - the son of 16-year-old Helen Burns. Unmarried, she was expelled from her local Baptist church after she became pregnant - the result of an affair with a 33-year-old married neighbour, Noah Robinson.
When Jackson was two, his mother married Charles Jackson, who went on to adopt his new stepson. Jesse Jackson remained in touch with Robinson, and regarded both men as his fathers.
Charles Jackson was a religious man, and his son was brought up in the church - a traditional focus for black political resistance since the time of American slavery.
Growing up in South Carolina, Jackson, like all black Americans, was segregated from his white neighbours. He was forced to attend separate schools and allowed only in designated areas in public places, like buses or restaurants.
In high school, Jackson did well - being elected as class president and excelling in nearly every kind of team sport.
A football scholarship to the University of Illinois helped Jackson pursue his ambitions and escape his poor surroundings. But he soon transferred from the predominantly white institution to a historically black college in North Carolina.
He said he left Illinois because his white coaches wouldn't let him play quarterback in American football, although that account is disputed. Records show the team already had a black quarterback and Jackson was on academic probation.
As a student in North Carolina A&T, Jackson gradually became involved with the civil rights movement. In 1960, he was arrested with seven other students after a silent demonstration in a whites-only public library, which led to the desegregation of the library.
Four years later, Jackson graduated and moved to Chicago, where he trained to become a religious leader and was noticed by King, the country's most famous civil rights leader.
Through the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King founded in 1957 to promote non-violent action to seek social and economic justice, he established Operation Breadbasket. The operation encouraged black men and women to frequent businesses that gave them basic courtesy and job opportunities, and to boycott those that did not.
Still in his 20s, Jackson was first asked to run the Chicago arm of the operation and, before long, to take on the national leadership.
In 1968, Jackson's life changed dramatically. He was with his mentor at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, when King was assassinated. Moments before the fatal shot, King was leaning over a railing in playful conversation with Jackson, who was standing in the parking lot below.
Jackson told reporters that he cradled King's head as he died - although other witnesses did not confirm that account. The next day, Jackson controversially appeared on television with his clothes still stained with King's blood, assuming the mantle of civil rights leadership.
""We were determined we would not let one bullet kill the movement,"" he later said.
Jackson, like King had done in the years before his death, began speaking about America's problems as rooted in class inequality as much as racism. The principal schism, he said, was between the haves and the have-nots.
""When we change the race problem into a class fight,"" he told the New York Times, ""then we are going to have a new ball game.""
Three years later, arguments over leadership led Operation Breadbasket to fracture and Jackson to form Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) - a new, wide-ranging civil rights group.
In the years that followed, Jackson became one of the most influential political figures in America.
His PUSH organisation championed inner-city education and affirmative action programmes that saw businesses employing black workers.
But he remained a controversial figure, with allegations that he had once made antisemitic remarks, and - as an ordained minister and the result of an unwanted pregnancy - he opposed abortion.
The issue was convulsing US politics after the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade. Democrats, who traditionally aligned with the civil rights movement, mostly supported keeping abortion legal.
""Human beings cannot give or create life by themselves, it is really a gift from God,"" he wrote in 1977. ""Therefore, one does not have the right to take away that which he does not have the ability to give.""
He suggested that Moses and Jesus would not have been born, had abortion been a possibility in biblical times.
In 1983, Jackson travelled to Syria to plead for the release of a captured American pilot, Lt Robert Goodman. His mission was successful, and greatly boosted his national profile.
With black youth unemployment running at around 50%, Jackson then announced a run for president.
His decision caused heartache for some of his natural supporters, including King's widow, Coretta, who feared he would fail to win the Democratic Party's nomination and damage the chances of other progressive candidates.
During the campaign, Jackson spoke about the ""rainbow coalition"", a broad group of voters from a variety of races and beliefs who were traditionally disadvantaged and who, Jackson said, had been hurt by the policies of then-President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.
""Our flag is red, white, and blue, but our nation is a rainbow - red, yellow, brown, black, and white - and we're all precious in God's sight,"" he said in a speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, where he called for the party to unify.
Jackson copyrighted the term and later founded a political group with the same name. The move irritated some members of the Black Panther organisation, who in the 1960s had used the term to describe an alliance between activists groups in Chicago.
While Jackson ultimately lost the Democratic nomination, his campaign had become a political and cultural phenomenon. In October 1984, he hosted Saturday Night Live – a popular weekly network television comedy programme.
His presidential bid also had a profound effect on Democrats. By winning more than 3 million votes and coming third during the primaries, he showed that a black candidate could rally nationwide support and possibly take the White House.
At the same time, by running on a liberal platform, he brought many of the issues important to the party's left wing to the fore and gave them traction, such as universal healthcare and paying reparations to the descendants of slaves.
Jackson was on record as a supporter of a Palestinian state, and had called Israel's prime minister ""a terrorist"".
He had also pledged never to use nuclear weapons first and to slash defence spending if he became president - positions that seemed impossible at the height of the Cold War.
He tried for the White House again four years later and continued to campaign on a liberal agenda of higher taxes, increased public spending and universal, state-funded healthcare.
Once more, he made an impressive showing - taking an early lead over Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee - but once more, he lost, this time after winning just under 7 million votes and 1,023 delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
Those delegates went on to back reforms to the party's primary process that made it easier for insurgent candidacies like Jackson to compete for the party's presidential nomination without backing from the Democratic establishment.
In 1991, Jackson tried to repeat his Syrian triumph, and visited Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War to plead with Saddam Hussein to release Western hostages.
A year later, he decided against a third presidential run and, despite his suspicion of Bill Clinton's centrist ""Third Way"" policies, lent his support to the former Arkansas governor.
When Clinton found his presidency in peril after the public learned about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, he asked Jackson to counsel his family through the crisis.
Jackson said that, although Clinton had lied about the relationship, he did not deserve to be impeached for ""high crimes"". Clinton had committed a ""little crime"", he said.
In 2001, Jackson was publicly called to account for his own affair, when it was revealed he had had a relationship with a member of his staff and fathered a child.
Jackson promised to take leave to ""revive my spirit and reconnect with my family"", but the speed with which he returned to public life damaged his credibility with some clergy across America.
He maintained a highly visible media profile with television shows and mercy missions, which some critics cast as self-promotion.
In March 2007, Jackson pledged his support for Barack Obama's campaign to become the first African American in the White House.
Relations between the two men were initially strained, after Jackson criticised Obama for ""talking down to black people"".
His remarks were picked up by a nearby microphone and Jackson later apologised for his ""crude and hurtful remarks"".
But, in the moments before Obama was due to make his victory speech in Chicago the following November, a television camera picked out Jackson in the audience with tears streaming down his cheeks.
Many of those watching suggested that Jackson's success in boosting black turnout in previous presidential campaigns had helped ensure Obama's victory.
He later backed the new president's decision to support gay marriage, comparing the situation to the earlier struggle against laws in the country that had barred interracial marriage.
While he continued to be a political force, he faced strain at home.
In 2013, his oldest son - Jesse Jackson Jr - was convicted of using campaign money to fund his personal lifestyle and sentenced to 30 months in prison.
Five years later, Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and had to step down as leader of Rainbow/PUSH, the merged organisation of his two earlier groups.
Still, after George Floyd, an African-American man, was killed by police officers in 2020, Jackson travelled to Minneapolis to plead for criminal charges against the officers.
And he was a loud voice in favour of withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan, and for increasing the minimum wage.
In 2024, Jackson applied for a presidential pardon for his son's conviction, but was refused by then-President Joe Biden.
That year, the veteran campaigner also returned to the political realm he loved, making a rare appearance at the Democratic convention in Chicago, where the party officially nominated Kamala Harris for president.
High-profile delegates paid tribute to a man they said had done much to ensure a black woman had a significant chance of reaching the White House. Harris later lost the 2024 election to Donald Trump.
""We learned at his feet,"" said Al Sharpton, a fellow veteran civil rights activist who had worked with Jackson at Operation Breadbasket decades earlier.
Pramila Jayapal, a congresswoman from Washington state, addressed him as she spoke at the convention, saying: ""For every elected official we will see on that stage - we are here because you laid the path for us.""

Hillary Clinton accuses Trump administration of Epstein files 'cover-up' in BBC interview,2026-02-17T07:59:55.144Z," Jessica Parker
Berlin correspondent
","Hillary Clinton has accused US President Donald Trump's administration of a ""cover-up"" over its handling of files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
""Get the files out. They are slow-walking it,"" the former US secretary of state told the BBC in Berlin, where she attended the annual World Forum.
The White House insisted that by releasing the files they had done ""more for the victims than Democrats ever have"".
Millions of new files relating to the late sex offender Epstein were released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) earlier this month.

At the time, the deputy attorney general said three million pages were not released - due to the existence of personal medical files, graphic depictions of child abuse or other material that would jeopardise investigations.
When asked whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor should go before a congressional committee, Hillary Clinton said: ""I think everybody should testify who is asked to testify.""
Appearing in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.
The committee does not have the power to compel him to appear in front of them, but put pressure on the Clintons to do so, which they agreed to last month.
Bill Clinton will make his appearance on 27 February and Hillary Clinton will appear the day before.
A planned vote to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress for initially refusing to appear was shelved after the pair agreed to testify. It will be the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.
Hillary Clinton reiterated the couple's call for their congressional committee hearing to be in public rather than a closed-door deposition.
""We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public,"" Hillary Clinton told the BBC.
Republican committee chair James Comer had accused the Clintons of ""delay"", saying the pair ""caved"" as a contempt vote loomed.
""I just want it to be fair,"" said Hillary Clinton. ""I want everybody treated the same way.""
""We have nothing to hide. We have called for the full release of these files repeatedly. We think sunlight is the best disinfectant.""
The former presidential candidate argued that she and her husband were being used to divert attention away from Trump.
""Look at this shiny object. We're going to have the Clintons, even Hillary Clinton, who never met the guy.""
Hillary Clinton said she had met Ghislaine Maxwell - Epstein's convicted associate - ""on a few occasions"".
Bill Clinton - who was featured in the Epstein files - was acquainted with Epstein but said he cut off contact two decades ago.
Neither Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and both have denied knowledge of his sex offending at the time.
The millions of new files relating to Epstein that were made public by the US justice department earlier this month after Congress passed a law requiring the agency to release material related to investigations of Epstein.
The Department of Justice (DoJ) has now said it has released all of the files required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers have argued the release is insufficient. Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who co-wrote the law, called for the DoJ to also release internal memos outlining past decisions on whether to charge Epstein and his associates.
Epstein took his own life in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited, without the chance of bail, his trial on sex trafficking charges. It came more than a decade after his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender.
Andrew, the former prince, has faced growing pressure from some US officials and the family of his prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre to testify before the Oversight Committee about his links to Epstein.
Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 containing no admission of liability. Giuffre died by suicide in 2025.
Trump - who is mentioned in the Epstein files - has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.
When asked about Hillary Clinton's comments in the interview, Trump told the BBC he had nothing to hide.
""I've been exonerated. I had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. They went in hoping that they'd find it, and they found just the opposite,"" he said aboard Air Force One.
""They're getting pulled in. And that's their problem... Clinton and many other Democrats have been pulled in.""
In relation to the allegations against Trump, the DoJ has previously said: ""Some docs contain untrue and sensationalist claims against Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear the claims are unfounded and false and if they have any shred of credibility they certainly would have been weaponised against Trump already.""
The White House said: ""By releasing thousands of pages of documents, co-operating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.""

"FBI won't co-operate on Alex Pretti investigation, state officials say",2026-02-17T03:43:19.498Z," Harry Sekulich
","Officials in the US state of Minnesota say the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has refused to co-operate with their investigation into the death of Alex Pretti.
US Customs and Border Protection agents shot dead the 37-year-old intensive care nurse during a protest against immigration enforcement in the city of Minneapolis on 24 January.
Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) has accused the FBI of failing to hand over any information and evidence from its investigation into the shooting.
BCA Supt Drew Evans called the FBI's actions ""concerning and unprecedented"". The FBI has not yet responded.
Minnesota's BCA said it would ""welcome a joint investigation"" with federal officials.
""The BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,"" it said in a statement.
Pretti's family has also pushed for a joint investigation, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.
""Justice and accountability requires a thorough and impartial investigation to establish the facts. A truly joint state and federal investigation would be a welcome development,"" Pretti's family said in a statement.
A separate civil rights investigation into Pretti's death was announced by the Department of Justice in January.
The BCA said it is also investigating the shootings of Renee Good, who was killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on 7 January, and a Venezuelan national who was injured after a car chase one week later.
""It remains unclear if there will be any co-operation or sharing of information related to those two shootings,"" the BCA said.
State and federal officials sparred over the course of Operation Metro Surge, an immigration crackdown launched by the Trump administration.
It prompted a wave of national protests opposing US President Donald Trump's migration policy and the tactics of ICE.
White House border tsar Tom Homan announced a ""drawdown"" of the Minnesota operation last Thursday.
More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to Homan, including men he said were convicted of rape and other sexual offences.
Minnesota's Democrat Governor Tim Walz said the operation left the state with ""deep damage, generational trauma... and many unanswered questions"".

US Senator Mark Kelly tells BBC he will 'seriously consider' White House run,2026-02-17T02:28:08.952Z," Chris Graham
","US Democratic Senator Mark Kelly has said he will ""seriously consider"" running for president in 2028 as he battles the Trump administration over a video in which he urged military personnel to refuse illegal orders.
The Arizona senator, who was accused of ""seditious behaviour"" by Donald Trump over the November clip, said he and his wife, Gabrielle Giffords, received ""many"" death threats after the president's comments.
""We get them on a weekly basis now,"" he told BBC Newsnight. ""We had to get security to protect us 24 hours a day.""
Asked if he was considering a White House run, the retired Navy captain said he was considering it ""because we're in some seriously challenging times"".
The 61-year-old, who is a former astronaut, noted he was very different from most senators.
""I'm one of the very few engineers, I'm the only person with a graduate degree in engineering in the United States Senate. I've got combat experience, that's kind of rare. I spent 25 years in the military,"" he said.
He added: ""It's a serious decision. I just haven't made it yet.""
Kelly, 61, and five other lawmakers, who had all either served in the military or had roles in intelligence, have been targeted by the government after they published a 90-second video encouraging troops to disobey orders they deemed illegal.
It was released at the time of rising questions of the legality regarding American strikes on alleged narco-trafficking boats off the coast of South America.
The Pentagon has since tried in vain to demote his military rank and a grand jury have declined to charge him with seditious conspiracy.
But Kelly said he expected Trump to continue his legal action against him.
He added: ""This is not going to end by me going away. I'm going to continue to fight this thing even if it goes all the way to the Supreme Court.""
Critics of the Trump administration have called the government's crackdown on the six lawmakers an attack on free speech and said it was another instance of the president seeking to punish those he perceives as political enemies.
Kelly said the death threats he received were also aimed at his wife Giffords, who was nearly assassinated as a member of Congress in 2011 when she was shot in the head.
""Donald Trump, is so reckless about what he says,"" he said. ""There are folks out there that, you know, react to what he said and people listen to him.""
The BBC has contacted the White House for comment.
Among the other Democrats considering a presidential run are Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in 2024, and California Governor Gavin Newsom.
Ina BBC interview in October, Harris said she would ""possibly"" be president one day and was confident there would be a woman in the White House in future.
Despite the 22nd amendment of the US constitution barring presidents from seeking a third term, Trump has not ruled out such a possibility.
However, he has also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them ""unstoppable"".

Trump directs federal authorities to manage sewage spill 'disaster',2026-02-17T00:02:00.332Z," Sakshi Venkatraman
US reporter
","US President Donald Trump is directing federal agencies to help manage a sewage spill that has led to millions of gallons of wastewater flowing into the Potomac River, which runs through the nation's capital.
In a social media post on Monday, Trump ordered federal authorities to ""immediately provide all necessary Management, Direction, and Coordination to protect the Potomac"", saying local leaders were turning the river ""into a Disaster Zone"".
Part of a sewer line in Maryland collapsed in late January, creating what public health experts say is one of the largest sewage spills in US history.
The river originates in West Virginia and flows through Maryland and Washington to the Chesapeake Bay.
Trump said that going forward, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), will lead the response.
But he noted that FEMA's funding is currently frozen after DHS ran out of money last week. Republican and Democratic lawmakers are in a standoff over funding for the department, as Democrats demand it make changes to its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, and they are not expected to approve a new DHS spending bill until the end of the month, at the earliest.
On 19 January, officials discovered a rupture in a section of the Potomac Interceptor sewer line, which is managed by the DC Water and Sewer Authority.
This break caused the ""uncontrolled overflow of wastewater into the Potomac River"", DC Water said in a press release, adding that since then, crews have been working around the clock to contain the overflow.
Washington and Maryland officials say the spill has not impacted drinking water, but have still advised residents to stay away from the Potomac River.
Sampling of the river's water has revealed concentrations of E. coli and MRSA bacteria, which can lead to serious health problems, according to local researchers.
In a public hearing on Friday, DC Water officials said the rupture could take several weeks to fix - and that it could take months to make permanent repairs to the collapsed line.
Trump in his social media post blamed Democratic leaders in Maryland for the ""massive Ecological Disaster"", specfically accusing Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who frequently clashes with him, of ""gross mismanagement"".
""It is clear Local Authorities cannot adequately handle this calamity,"" he said, adding, ""The Federal Government has no choice, but to step in.""
Moore's office says that since the Potomac Interceptor is managed by Washington DC officials, the response is actually the responsibility of the federal government, not the state of Maryland.
""The President has his facts wrong - again,"" Moore's spokesperson Ammar Moussa told the BBC. ""For the last four weeks, the Trump Administration has failed to act, shirking its responsibility and putting people's health at risk.""

'It's never too late': Savannah Guthrie's new plea for mother's release as FBI analyses glove,2026-02-16T23:37:30.585Z," Grace Eliza Goodwin
","Savannah Guthrie has issued a plea for her 84-year-old mother's release two weeks after she disappeared in a suspected kidnapping, telling anyone involved that ""it is never too late to do the right thing"".
In her latest video appeal, the US TV anchor addresses ""whoever has her, or knows where she is"" - adding that Nancy Guthrie's loved ones ""still have hope"".
Currently, investigators are analysing DNA found on a glove that they recovered, which appears to match one that was worn by a suspect who appeared in doorbell-camera footage taken the night Nancy Guthrie went missing.
Authorities believe the suspect in the video kidnapped Guthrie in the early hours of 1 February.
The FBI said on Sunday that investigators recovered the glove from a field near the side of the road about two miles (three km) from Guthrie's home in Tucson, Arizona.
The agency collected about 16 gloves from various locations near Nancy Guthrie's home, though most turned out to have been discarded by people searching for her.
""The one with the DNA profile recovered is different and appears to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video,"" the FBI said.
The agency said it has received preliminary DNA test results on the glove and is still waiting for ""quality control and official confirmation"" before entering an ""unknown male profile"" into its database.
Earlier this week, investigators released video footage taken from a doorbell camera at Guthrie's front door that showed a masked man wearing gloves and a backpack.
In the video, the suspect walks toward the camera and tries to cover it with his gloved hand before grabbing some brush from the front yard to block the camera's view.
After conducting a forensic analysis of the video, the FBI announced earlier this week that it believed the man was between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall with an average build.
The FBI also highlighted the backpack the suspect was wearing in the video, identifying it as a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.
The clothing and face mask worn by the suspect in the video appear to have been purchased at Walmart, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told the BBC's US news partner CBS News. CBS also reported that the backpack is only sold at Walmart stores.
Officials have been reviewing surveillance footage from nearby Walmart locations, Nanos said, though a corporate spokesperson declined to comment to CBS.
Police have said the suspect description ""remains a key focus"", but added that ""investigators are not ruling out any individuals or possibilities"".
On Monday the sheriff leading the local investigation said Guthrie's family, including all siblings and their spouses, had ""been cleared as possible suspects in this case"".
Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when a family member dropped her off at her home following a get-together at her other daughter Annie Guthrie's house.
Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.
In the two weeks since Guthrie's disappearance, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Office have conducted a massive search operation involving helicopters, sniffer dogs and hundreds of officers, while taking in thousands of call-in tips.
Officials have warned that her health may be at severe risk without her medication. Nanos, the local sheriff, has said she is ""not in good physical health"" but has no reported cognitive issues.
On Friday, authorities executed a search warrant at a residence two miles from Guthrie's home but made no arrests.
Local officials have also said investigators found DNA at Guthrie's address that did not belong to her or anyone close to her.
The FBI has increased the reward for information about her disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.

Obama clarifies views on aliens after saying 'they're real' on podcast,2026-02-16T10:43:26.931Z," Cachella Smith
","Former US President Barack Obama has clarified that the chances Earth has been visited by aliens is ""low"" after comments he made about extra-terrestrial species caught attention online.
""They're real but I haven't seen them,"" he told American podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen during an interview published on Saturday.
""They're not being kept in Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,"" he added.
Obama has since said his comments were made in line with ""the spirit of the speed round"" of questions, adding that statistically the chances are that life is out there but he saw ""no evidence"" while president.
Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire ""lightning"" round of questions.
""Are aliens real?"" Cohen had asked as his first question of the round for the former president.
Obama's answer was subsequently run in different media outlets and attracted attention online - prompting him to publish a clarifying statement on his official Instagram account on Sunday.
""I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it's gotten attention let me clarify,"" he wrote in a caption that accompanied the video clip from the podcast.
""Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!""
Obama, who served as president of the United States between 2009 and 2017, has previously made comments about aliens and UFOs - telling late night TV host James Corden in 2021 that on coming into office he asked whether there was a lab ""where we're keeping the alien specimens and space ship"".
""They did a little bit of research and the answer was no,"" he said - but also pointed to records and footage of objects in the sky that had not been explained at the time.

Ex-church minister who admitted child sexual abuse to BBC still free years later,2026-02-16T00:29:57.327Z," George Wright
","An ex-minister of a shadowy Christian church who told the BBC he sexually abused a child in Canada is still free more than two years after he made his admission.
Robert Corfield admitted when confronted by the BBC that he sexually abused a boy, Michael Havet, in the 1980s. Corfield's was one of more than 1,100 names given to a hotline set up to report sexual abuse within the church, which has no official name but is often referred to as The Truth or the Two by Twos.
The FBI launched a probe into the church around a month after the BBC published its investigation in early 2024, but Corfield remains free in the US state of Montana despite him saying investigators visited him more than a year ago.
We have now spoken to a man who says he was also sexually abused by Corfield in 1974 when he was 11 years old - around a decade before he started abusing Michael. Corfield previously claimed to the BBC that he had not sexually abused anyone else.
The FBI did not respond to requests for comment.
Asked about Michael's case, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said it launched an investigation after it ""received a report of historic sexual assaults that occurred in the early 1980s"" in Saskatchewan and that its ""findings were sent to Crown Prosecutors for their assessment"".
The Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice said it ""does not comment on whether it is reviewing cases under investigation by the police"".
The Truth is believed to have up to 100,000 members worldwide, with the majority in North America.
It was founded in Ireland by a Scottish evangelist in 1897 and is built around ministers - referred to by the church as workers - spreading New Testament teachings through word-of-mouth.
One of its hallmarks is that workers give up their possessions and must be taken in by church members as they travel around, spreading the gospel. This makes children living in the homes they visit vulnerable to abuse, former members say.
Warning: This article contains details some readers may find upsetting
Contacted by phone in December 2025, Corfield told the BBC that he was visited by the FBI a year ago.
""They saw me in person. They basically reviewed information and I just responded with the truth,"" he said.
Asked whether he told them that he abused Michael, now 57, for six years starting when he was 12, Corfield replied ""yes"" before adding: ""It was a year ago - I don't remember all the details.""
He added that the FBI ""were satisfied at that point and I haven't been contacted by anyone else since"".
Asked if he was fearful of arrest, Corfield said: ""I realise there is that possibility.""
He was no longer attending church meetings, he added.
Last month, another man contacted the BBC about being abused by Corfield.
The man, who is entitled to anonymity but we will call Edward, said that Corfield attacked him on a camping trip in Canada in 1974.
""Robert got mad at me for something - I don't remember exactly what that was. Then he called me into the camper,"" he said.
""I can only remember him being angry and holding me down. I just remember the cushions being covered with that weird 70s floral pattern … he ended up holding me down on the bed,"" he added.
""He went from angry to sexually assaulting me.""
Edward recalled another time when a group of boys were swimming on church convention grounds and he saw Corfield watching, ""blanket over his lap, doing something inappropriate to himself underneath the blanket"".
Corfield ""was in constant grooming mode"", Edward said.
He tried to tell his parents about what Corfield did to him, but said ""they wouldn't even hear a name from me"".
The power of the workers in the church means they are rarely challenged.
""When my incident happened with Robert, I tried to talk to my parents about it and neither one of them would have anything to do with that, because he was a preacher and he could do no wrong,"" Edward said.
""Our house was an open door, the workers had keys to the house,"" he added.
""They were on the pedestal, they were the moral compass. The family kind of didn't have a moral compass on its own, they only only looked at right and wrong based on what the workers said. Right and wrong wasn't about what your heart or soul said.""
Edward reported the attack to the RCMP in 2024 but the prosecutor's office declined to prosecute the case due to lack of evidence.
Corfield declined to comment about the latest allegations when contacted last week.
However, the BBC has obtained two private letters Corfield sent to Michael, in 2004 and 2005, which asked for forgiveness and said he was seeing a therapist. In one letter, Corfield said he was ""making a list of victims"".
The church has been thrown into crisis since more than 1,500 current and former members of the sect contacted a hotline set up by campaign group, Advocates for The Truth, in 2023.
The Advocates have since ceased operations, but co-founder and private investigator, Cynthia Liles, is still running the hotline under the name 2x2 Church Accountability.
There have been 1,164 allegations of sexual abuse, she said, with more than half of the accused in positions of authority. There have been approximately 75 convictions, she said.
But despite Corfield admitting to sexually abusing a child for six years, he remains free.
""I'm confused by the law enforcement in Canada. Robert is a confessed pedophile…he took responsibility for abusing me for six years,"" Michael told the BBC in a message.
He also wants to see the church's leadership face justice, some of whom have been accused of covering up abuse.
In our previous investigation, Michael said he reported his abuse in 1993 to Dale Shultz, Saskatchewan's most senior church leader - known as an ""overseer"". Overseers are the most senior members of the church and there is one for each US state and Canadian province where there is an active following.
But Shultz didn't go to the police and Michael says he violently assaulted him a few weeks later because he thought he had told others of the abuse claims.
Michael said Shultz then ""encouraged"" him to leave the church - while Corfield was moved to be a minister across the border, in the US state of Montana.
Corfield told the BBC in 2024 that he believed it was Shultz's decision to send him to Montana, where he remained in post for 25 years.
Shultz previously told the BBC that ""much of the information that you have received concerning me is distorted and inaccurate"". However he declined to go into any further detail.
""I'm frustrated that the RCMP refused to include the leadership. They failed the membership,"" Michael said last week.
""Robert is guilty, sure. Dale and all the enablers are guilty also,"" he added.
Edward said ""it's completely ridiculous"" that Corfield is still free.
""What kind of pressure does the RCMP need to feel to make this move forward?"" he said.
The RCMP directed questions to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice, who declined to comment.
The church itself has done little to address the sexual abuse crisis, said Liles, the private investigator, who herself was born into the sect before leaving.
""In fact I think they're going backwards,"" she said. ""I think they retracted from positions they originally took in an attempt to show that they were going to try to make changes.""
Some states initially hired an organisation that helps Christian groups confront sexual abuses, she said, but the church ended up rejecting the policies.
""They just said: 'we don't need any of this, we're just going to use the Bible,'"" Liles said.
Many perpetrators of sexual abuse are back in church meetings, Liles said, including one man in Arizona who was jailed for rape in 1969, made a church elder upon release and then went on to abuse other children within the church.
The BBC reached out to multiple church overseers for comment, but did not get a response.
While the wheels of justice are moving slowly for victims, many are connecting online. One Facebook group called 'Exposing Abuse: 2x2s' has more than 10,000 members from across the world offering each other support.
After Corfield's public confession two years ago, Edward reached out to Michael.
""I reached out to Michael very, very soon after that and we managed to stay in contact over the last few years and develop a relationship,"" he said.
""For us to know each other, it gets rid of that isolated 'me against the world' feeling - it's actually us against the church.""
Edward is also now receiving counselling to work through his experiences in the church.
""It's not the church that's helping to fund my counselling sessions, it's a bunch of ex-church members,"" he said.
""That's been a godsend for me.""

Bondi criticised after saying all Epstein files have been released,2026-02-15T21:32:23.572Z," Grace Eliza Goodwin
","The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has said it has released all of the files required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers have argued the release is insufficient.
A letter sent to members of the US Congress on Saturday from US Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputy said all documents held by the DoJ had been released. It contained a list of names appearing in the files.
Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who co-wrote the law, called for the DoJ to also release internal memos outlining past decisions on whether to charge Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.
Millions of new files relating to the late sex offender Epstein were released by the DoJ earlier this month. At the time, the deputy attorney general said three million pages were not released.
This was due to the existence of personal medical files, graphic depictions of child abuse or other material that would jeopardise investigations, said Todd Blanche on the day of the documents dump.
In the latest letter, Bondi and Blanche wrote: ""In accordance with the requirements of the Act, and as described in various Department submissions to the courts of the Southern District of New York assigned to the Epstein and Maxwell prosecutions and related orders, the Department released all 'records, documents, communications and investigative materials in the possession of the Department' that 'relate to' any of nine different categories.""
No records were withheld from the DoJ's release ""on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity"", the letter added.
The individuals listed in the letter include people who ""are or were a government official or politically exposed person"", and whose name appeared at least once in the files, the letter says.
The names appear in the files in a ""wide variety of contexts"", including some people who had ""extensive direct email contact with Epstein or Maxwell"" and others who were merely referenced in documents or news articles contained in the files, Blanche and Bondi wrote.
Donald Trump, Bill Gates, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and Bill Clinton - who are included in the list - all had documented past relationships with Epstein and Maxwell. There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing and each has denied any involvement in Epstein's crimes.
But the list also includes the names of deceased musicians Janis Joplin and Elvis Presley.
The letter was addressed to the Senate Judiciary Committee's chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Dick Durbin, as well as the House Judiciary Committee's chairman Jim Jordan and ranking member Jamie Raskin.
In an interview on ABC This Week on Sunday, Massie argued that, even though the DoJ ""wants to say they are done with this document production"", there are more crucial files that should be released.
The DoJ was ""signing deliberative process privilege in order not to release some of the documents"", he said.
""The problem with that is the bill that Ro Khanna and I wrote says that they must release internal memos and notes and emails about their decisions on whether to prosecute or not prosecute, whether to investigate or not investigate.""
In response to the letter, California Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, who co-wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act, accused the DoJ of ""purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email"".
""To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd,"" Khanna wrote on X on Saturday.
""Release the full files,"" he added. ""Stop protecting predators. Redact only the survivor's names.""
The BBC has contacted the Department of Justice for comment.
US lawmakers previously said files on Epstein were improperly redacted ahead of their release, leading to at least one document being unredacted after their criticism.
Lawyers for Epstein's victims have also said the latest tranche of files included email addresses and nude photos in which the names and faces of potential victims could be identified.
At the time, the DoJ said mistakes were due to ""technical or human error"" and they had taken down all the flagged files.

"An abduction, a Bitcoin demand and a TV icon - why Nancy Guthrie's case has gripped the US",2026-02-15T02:02:34.188Z," David Willis
Tucson
Arizona
","Before the sun rose over a barren desert landscape, YouTuber Jimmy Williams watched as hundreds of subscribers took to his online chat room.
A laptop balanced precariously on his knees, his iPhone framed by a ring light, he spends several hours a day dissecting the details of Nancy Guthrie's sudden disappearance with his rapidly growing audience of fellow true-crime enthusiasts.
Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and authorities believe she was taken against her will in the early hours of 1 February.
Williams is just one of dozens of curious observers and amateur sleuths who have descended on the area.
The influx of spectators has turned a quiet mid-size city, popular with retirees, into a global media spectacle.
Police have yet to identify any suspects in her abduction, and her daughter – the Today show presenter Savannah Guthrie – has repeatedly begged the public for help in finding her mother.
A reassuring face on morning television in the US, Savannah Guthrie now finds herself at the same intersection of hope and dread that has defined many of her interviewees.
This time, however, the roles have been reversed, and instead of asking questions she is the one awaiting answers.
Breakfast television affords its presenters a special sense of intimacy with their audience, with segments often focusing on human-interest stories.
Savannah Guthrie spent her childhood in Tucson and in November she even invited people into her mum's home for a segment on the Today show.
Kelly Himes lives several miles from Nancy Guthrie's home in the shadow of the Catalina Mountains. Like a growing number of Tucson residents, she felt compelled to stop and say a prayer alongside the growing array of flowers at the end of her driveway.
""Nancy's the same age as my mum, the same height as my mum, and she's got the same hair,"" Himes tells the BBC. ""She lives alone just like my mum does. This is someone who could be anybody's mother.""
Savannah Guthrie's fame has proved to be a double-edged sword. As well as drawing an unprecedented amount of attention and resources to the search for her mother, it has also inspired feverish speculation and given rise to a string of false leads.
Two weeks after Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, investigators revealed they had found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from her home.
The sheriff's department also said media reports that a glove had been found inside her home or on the property were inaccurate.
To Williams' growing audience, speculation over the case only heightens its intrigue.
Since Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, Williams' YouTube channel Dollyvision has gained more than 8,000 new subscribers.
Interest in Nancy's disappearance is ""massive"", he says.
""You expect kidnappings to involve cash in a bag dropped off somewhere remote, and then the police turn up and arrest everyone. This is different. This is like a 'new age' of kidnapping.""
The days of ransom demands made up of letters cut from the pages of a magazine seem a thing of the past.
Secure servers, secret IP addresses and untraceable Bitcoin accounts have changed the face of one of the world's oldest crimes - but a former FBI hostage negotiator, Chip Massey, says he believes Nancy Guthrie's kidnappers would soon be caught.
Referring to the video images of a masked man on her doorstep shortly before she disappeared, he said somebody, somewhere, would recognise the suspect based either on their behaviour or their body language.
""The attention this case has generated is unprecedented,"" he says, ""and while a mask can conceal a face, it can't conceal a person.""
Missing person flyers featuring pictures of Nancy's smiling face, combined with motorway billboards promoting the FBI's tip line have made this case impossible to ignore, even for those who don't watch the news.
The White House has said the FBI would be giving the investigation its ""full resources"".
""So many people now seem to be engaged with this search that it is going to very hard for this individual to function,"" says Massey.
""That sort of scrutiny makes it impossible for a suspect to move and creates a sense of the world 'closing in' on them. That's when they start to make mistakes.""
Yellow ribbons now adorn the trees around Nancy Guthrie's home - but as days pass with no word of her whereabouts, the hope of an emotional homecoming is rapidly giving way to a deepening sense of dread.

Obama addresses racist video shared by Trump depicting him as an ape,2026-02-14T22:24:14.935Z," Max Matza
","Former US President Barack Obama has indirectly addressed a racist video posted on President Donald Trump's social media, telling a podcast host that the ""shame"" and ""decorum"" that once guided public officials is now lost.
The offensive video included a clip depicting Obama and his wife Michelle as apes, which drew widespread criticism from Democrats and Republicans.
The White House initially defended the video, calling backlash ""fake outrage"". The post was later blamed on a staff member and deleted.
Obama spoke to liberal podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, who asked the first black US president about the tone of political discourse. Cohen cited Trump's post among several recent controversies.
The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was included at the end of a video Trump's Truth Social account shared containing unfounded claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election.
The post led to outrage from politicians, including from senior members of Trump's Republican party.
Senator Tim Scott - the only black Republican senator - described it as ""the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House"".
The clip recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys, and appears to have been taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October.
Trump has told reporters that he ""didn't see"" the part of the video that showed the Obamas.
""I didn't make a mistake,"" he told reporters when asked whether he planned to apologise.
The 47-minute podcast featuring Obama was released on Saturday. The episode begins with the host asking him to comment on US ""discourse"", which he says ""has devolved to a level of cruelty that we haven't seen before"".
Cohen notes claims by the White House that the ""victims"" of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are ""domestic terrorists"", and adds ""just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face, on an ape's body"".
Obama responds by saying: ""It's important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling.
""It is true that it gets attention. It's true that it's a distraction.""
But Obama said that while travelling around the US, he found himself meeting people who ""still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness"".
""There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television,"" he continued.
""And what is true is that there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right?
""That's been lost.""
He did not mention Trump by name in his response.
During the interview, Obama spoke about a range of issues. He praised protesters who have peacefully organised against immigration operations, discussed electoral redistricting and talked about his presidential library, which is due to open in Chicago next year.

No arrests made after police search residence near Nancy Guthrie's home,2026-02-14T20:48:00.974Z," Alexander Lederman
in Tucson
Arizona
","Police searched a residence about two miles from the home of Nancy Guthrie, the missing mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie, on Friday night.
The search warrant was based on a lead investigators had received, but no arrests were made, the Pima County sheriff's department said.
A person was also questioned at a traffic stop on Friday night, but was released, the department added.
It comes after local officials said investigators had found DNA at Guthrie's address that did not belong to her or anyone close to her.
The 84-year-old disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, two weeks ago. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.
The sheriff's department confirmed on Saturday that law enforcement officers had executed a federal court-ordered search warrant based on a lead at the residence in connection with the Guthrie case.
The department did not provide further details about the lead or the residents of the house, saying only that no one was arrested.
More than a dozen law enforcement vehicles, both marked and unmarked, were seen in the area by BBC News, including Swat teams and forensics.
Armed police teams were seen coming in and out of the area, with a sheriff's vehicle blocking the road.
Investigators have also found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home.
The sheriff's department said reports that a glove was found inside her home or on the property were inaccurate.
All collected evidence had been sent for laboratory analysis, they added.
On Thursday, the FBI released a physical description of the suspect, describing them as a male between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) with an average build.
It said investigators had been able to establish identifying details about the suspect after analysing footage from a doorbell camera outside Guthrie's home.
The suspect was wearing a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack in the footage, the FBI said.
After the doorbell footage was released, investigators received more than 13,000 tips, including 4,000 in the first 24 hours.
The FBI has also increased the reward for information about Guthrie's disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.
The county sheriff department said the suspect description ""remains a key focus"", but added that ""investigators are not ruling out any individuals or possibilities"".
Investigators have also issued a wider appeal for video footage from Guthrie's neighbours.
Police have said Nancy Guthrie, 84, needed daily medication and had limited mobility.
Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's abductor.
They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her safe return.

Casey Wasserman to sell talent agency after Epstein fallout,2026-02-14T13:28:26.460Z," Rachel Muller-Heyndyk
","Prominent US agent Casey Wasserman is selling his talent company after documents linking him to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were published in the US.
Several high-profile clients, including singer Chappell Roan, quit the firm this week after it emerged he flew on Epstein's private plane and exchanged flirtatious emails with Maxwell in 2003.
Wasserman said in an company-wide email sent on Friday that he had ""become a distraction"" as he announced he has begun the process to sell the major LA-based agency.
The 51-year-old, who has also resisted calls to stand down from his role as chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, previously said he had no ""personal or business relationship"" with Epstein.
""I'm deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,"" Wasserman wrote to the agency's 4,000 employees in the email, which was obtained by the BBC.
He continued: ""It's not fair to you, and it's not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about.""
Wasserman said he ""deeply regrets"" his discussions with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for facilitating the sexual abuse of teenage girls by Epstein.
He said his email exchanges with Maxwell ""took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light"".
Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.
Earlier this week, LA28 said Wasserman would remain chairman of the 2028 games after organisers reviewed his past interactions with Maxwell.
They found his relationship did not go further than the exchanges that had already been documented and that he had fully co-operated with an investigation.
The LA28 board said in a statement that Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein's plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation in 2003.
The board said the journey was long before ""Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell's deplorable crimes"".
""This was his single interaction with Epstein. Shortly after, he traded the publicly-known emails with Maxwell,"" the statement continued.
A number of stars have have walked away from Wasserman's agency in recent days.
Chappell Roan announced that she would no longer be working with Wasserman in an Instagram post on Tuesday.
She said: ""No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.""
Roan did not specifically mention the Epstein-related documents in her statement.
Other musical artists have announced their plans to exit Wasserman's agency, including country music singer-songwriter Orville Peck, North Carolina-based rock band Wednesday, and singer-songwriter Weyes Blood.
Former US football player Abby Wambach also said she was leaving the agency, saying: ""I know what I know and I am following my gut and values. I will not participate in any business arrangement under his leadership.""

Tribes grant the Colorado River legal personhood - can this help save it?,2026-02-14T13:13:13.100Z,No Author Listed,
"'Canadians are with you,' says PM at Tumbler Ridge vigil",2026-02-14T05:17:27.594Z," Nadine Yousif
Senior Canada reporter
in Tumbler Ridge
British Columbia
","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has attended a vigil in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, where hundreds gathered to mourn the eight victims killed in a mass shooting there this week.
He visited the small town on Friday alongside other federal leaders across the political aisle, as well as Canada's Governor-General Mary Simon, in a show of national unity.
""Canadians are with you, we will always be with you,"" Carney told the crowd in a speech that paid tribute to the victims, which included six young schoolchildren.
Residents of the town are still reeling from the attack, with some visibly in tears and comforting one another as Carney and other leaders addressed their grief.
Many refused to speak to the media on Friday, noting that the presence of journalists in their otherwise quiet town in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains had been overwhelming.
Carney, who has spent much of his time in office on overseas trade missions, cancelled a planned trip to the Munich Security Conference in light of the shooting.
The prime minister invited the other federal leaders to travel to Tumbler Ridge on the same plane as him, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said.
""We all lead political parties. But today? There are no Conservatives. There are no Liberals, New Democrats, Greens or Bloc Québécois,"" Poilievre said in his own remarks at Friday's vigil.
Ahead of the vigil, Carney and other leaders met families of the victims and first responders. They also laid flowers at a memorial near Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, which has grown over the week.
Families of the victims and local residents attended, as well as people who drove in from nearby small communities in northern British Columbia, to pay their respects.
""I never thought that it would happen here,"" said Colaina Hall, who drove two hours south from Fort St John to attend the vigil. ""In our little northern communities, we're pretty tight-knit, we take care of one another.""
""It is just devastating,"" she added.
Police have named the suspect in the shooting as 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, who also lived in the community. Van Rootselaar was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the school, police said.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) told reporters on Friday that it did not believe the suspect had been targeting anyone specific with the attack.
""This suspect was, for a lack of a better term, hunting,"" said RCMP deputy commissioner Dwayne McDonald. ""They were prepared, and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with.""
Police added that they had seized a total of four firearms related to the shooting - two from the suspect's home and two from the school.
Authorities earlier said they did not know how the suspect procured the weapons used in the shooting.
Police had previously said that Van Rootselaar had a firearm licence that expired in 2024.
While Van Rootselaar's mother, Jennifer Jacobs, who was also known as Jennifer Strang, had a licence to buy and possess guns, there were no firearms registered under that licence, McDonald said.
He added that by law there were ""certain types of firearms"" that did not have to be registered.
A 2021 Facebook post from Strang, 39, described how the teenager was interested in guns, BBC Verify found.
One post shared in 2021 by a relative shows the suspect holding a hunting rifle.
Strang was among those killed in the attack.
McDonald said police were still working to determine how Van Rootselaar was able to obtain the guns used in the attack, particularly the firearm ""believed to be the one that caused the most significant damage"" at the school.
He would not provide information about what style the primary gun from the school was, saying ""because of its unknown origin, we don't know if there's other parties in terms of procuring that weapon"".
Police have said Van Rootselaar was born a biological male but identified as a woman after starting to transition six years ago.
Guns were seized from the suspect's home in the past, police said, but were returned after a successful petition from the firearms' owner.
Neither guns used in the attack - which occurred both at the suspect's home and the school - were previously seized by police, McDonald clarified on Friday.
The suspect had a history of mental health struggles and was previously admitted for psychiatric evaluation, according to police.
Police also released an image of the suspect, noting that misinformation had been circulating on social media about the attack and the suspect's identity.
The school remained closed on Friday as the RCMP continued its investigation, though McDonald said he hoped that their work would be concluded soon, ""recognising that the town needs to heal"".
A total of nine people, including the suspected shooter, died in the shootings. That includes five children and one teacher at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, as well as two of the suspected shooter's family members at a local residence.
The RCMP confirmed that those killed at the school were: 12-year-old Kylie Smith, 12-year-old Abel Mwansa, 12-year-old Zoey Benoit, 12-year-old Ticaria Lampert, 13-year-old Ezekiel Schofield, and 39-year-old Shannda Aviugana-Durand.
Benoit's family remembered her as ""resilient, vibrant, smart, caring and the strongest little girl you could meet"" in a statement shared by the police.
""She brought so much laughter and smiles in her presence,"" they said. ""She loved spending time with her family where she could show her love.
""Our family is devastated by this loss, but we will cherish her memories with us so close to our hearts forever.""
Ticaria Lampert was just two months away from her 13th birthday, her mother Sarah Lampert said during a news conference on Thursday.
""I called her my tiki torch,"" Lampert said. ""She's always been a blazing light in the darkness and if you didn't manage to see her, you would definitely hear her.""
As well as the suspect's mother, 11-year-old stepbrother Emmett Jacobs was also killed, police confirmed.

"US homeland security shutdown could mean airport delays, travel groups say",2026-02-14T05:04:15.076Z," Madeline Halpert
","Travel groups and airlines are warning of potential disruption as the US federal government partially shut down after lawmakers failed to reach a deal on funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) .
Several groups, including Airlines for America, said in a joint statement on Friday that without a deal, the risk of unscheduled absences by Transportation Security Administration workers increased, causing flight delays and longer wait times.
""Travellers and the US economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay,"" they said.
A partial government shutdown began at midnight (05:00 GMT) on Saturday after Congress failed to pass a bill to fund DHS operations.
In exchange for a funding deal, Democrats had been pushing for more restrictions on US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which will not be significantly affected by the shutdown because of funding from the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" last year.
Democrats have been demanding reforms after federal agents killed Alex Pretti and Renee Good, two Minneapolis residents who were protesting the Trump administration's immigration raids in Minnesota, in January.
They have asked for a number of changes within the DHS including a ban on immigration agents wearing face masks, better identification for officers and stricter rules for obtaining warrants.
On Thursday, Senate Democrats blocked two funding bills because the measures did not include the immigration reforms. The most recent funding measure passed at the end of January only funded the DHS for two weeks while lawmakers from both sides of the aisle attempted to reach a deal on immigration reforms.
On Friday, US President Donald Trump said ""we'll see what happens"" when asked by reporters whether he anticipated cutting a deal with Democrats to fund the DHS.
""We always have to protect our law enforcement,"" Trump added.
The shutdown is expected to affect several agencies under the DHS umbrella, including the US Coast Guard and TSA.
Last year, the US government saw its longest full shutdown in history, which lasted 43 days and led to many federal workers going without pay as well as flight chaos. Democrats at the time were pushing for more health care funding to address rising health care costs.
Congress is set to take a recess until 23 February, meaning the shutdown could continue until Trump's State of the Union address the following day.
However, lawmakers could be called back to Washington earlier if they seem on the brink of a deal.
The partial shutdown is unlikely to cause as much travel chaos as last year's because the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees air traffic controllers, has already been funded for the rest of the year.
But TSA agents - who fall under the DHS - may have to go without pay if the shutdown drags on, meaning people could see longer lines at airports if workers call in sick.
The US Coast Guard, which the DHS also oversees, could also be affected. Vice Admiral Thomas Allan told lawmakers that going a few days without funding would mean about 56,000 workers going without pay, leading the agency to suspend missions that were not critical or lifesaving.
DHS has $165bn (£120bn) from Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act - which also included $75bn to fund ICE - that it could use to address some of the funding shortfalls.

Gasps and disbelief in US as 'Quad God's' Olympic dream crumbles,2026-02-14T00:13:01.149Z,No Author Listed,
What is the SAVE America Act that mandates voter ID?,2026-02-14T00:07:58.362Z," Ana Faguy
","The US House of Representatives this week passed legislation that would require people to provide proof-of-citizenship when registering to vote as the midterm elections approach.
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE America Act, would require people to present a valid US passport or birth certificate.
The proposal has raised concerns among some groups, including married individuals who have changed their names and may not have matching documents.
In a post on his social media site Truth Social, Trump warned that there would ""be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!""
Democrats say the legislation disenfranchises eligible voters, while Republicans say it is necessary to prevent voter fraud.
The bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where it does not have enough backers.
Here's what to know about this legislation.
The SAVE act would require Americans to prove they are US citizens when they register to vote. It would also require a valid photo identification before they cast their ballots.
Some states already require voters to show valid photo identification at the polls. Federal law mandates that voters in national election be US citizens, but it does not require mandatory proof of citizenship, as the proposed legislation would.
This bill - a renewed version of a legislation introduced last year that was stalled - establishes a process for people whose names have changed to submit additional documents to verify their identity.
The provision has drawn particular concern for individuals who changed their names after marriage.
Under the legislation, election officials who register a voter without obtaining the required proof of citizenship could face criminal penalties.
An estimated 21 million Americans do not have documents proving their citizenship readily available, and 2.6 million lack any form of government-issued photo ID, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal-leaning think tank, and the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement.
A Pew Research Center poll from last year found 83% of respondents favoured requiring all voters to show government-issued photo identification, including 71% of Democrat or Democratic-leaning voters and 95% of Republican or Republican-leaning voters.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly praised the legislation and encouraged his Republican party to push it through both chambers of Congress so he can sign it into law.
While supporting the bill, Trump has also repeated his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen. The president says the SAVE Act could stop that from happening.
""American citizens, and only American citizens, should decide American elections,"" the White House posted on social media, referencing a common talking point of the president's that there is widespread fraud in elections. There is no evidence to support this.
This week in a post on Truth Social, Trump repeated false claims about election fraud and said he would be presenting an ""irrefutable"" legal argument in defence of the measure ""in the very near future"".
Members of the president's party, by and large, support the legislation, too.
Congressman Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin Republican, disputed Democrats' comments that the bill is ""voter suppression"".
""Those allegations are false,"" he said, arguing that a bill is needed to enforce existing laws, especially those that prevent immigrants who are not citizens from voting.
""The current law is not strong enough,"" Steil said.
It is unclear if and when the Senate may vote on the measure.
The legislation passed the House, mostly along party lines, in a 218-213 vote.
But Majority Leader John Thune does not have the 60 votes he needs to pass the bill in the Senate.
Some have urged Thune to change the filibuster rules by lowering the threshold required to pass a bill.
""There aren't anywhere close to the votes, not even close, to nuking the filibuster,"" Thune said at a news conference on Tuesday. ""So that idea is something, although it continues to be put out there. … That doesn't have a future.""
In addition, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said she would not back the measure if it came for a vote, which would make passage even more difficult.
Democrats have also tried - unsuccessfully - to enact nationwide voting rules, as opposed to the current patchwork of state-by-state measures.
But the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act did not make it through Congress under the Biden presidency.

Canada Supreme Court overturns one-vote election win in Quebec,2026-02-13T22:59:53.139Z," Sakshi Venkatraman
","Canada's top court has nullified the result of an election in Quebec that was won by a single vote, leaving the seat vacant until a by-election is called.
The closely contested federal election last April in the electoral district, or riding, of Terrebonne, was initially declared for the Bloc Québécois, but a later recount found the Liberal party had won the seat by one vote.
The ruling means 25-year-old Tatiana Auguste, who won against Bloc member Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné and has been sitting in parliament since, is no longer an MP.
It further complicates the arithmetic for Prime Minister Mark Carney. His Liberals now sit three seats short of a majority in Canada's House of Commons.
The court ruled that the seat will now be vacant until a by-election is called, in which the two candidates will face off once again.
Sinclair-Desgagné called for a do-over last year after Canadian media reported a Bloc voter's mail-in ballot was returned because of a misprint in a postal code on the return envelope.
Auguste's team argued that classifying a clerical error as an election irregularity did not set a good precedent - and in October a lower court agreed, ruling that the misprint amounted to ""human error"" and was not grounds to overturn the election.
But Canada's Supreme Court disagreed on Friday, nullifying the election result.
Last year, it looked like Carney's Liberals were closing in on a majority.
But that now seems increasingly out of reach, as Terrebonne is a highly-contested district.
Before Auguste's brief tenure, it had been held by the Bloc for decades.

"ICE agents may have lied about shooting of migrant in Minneapolis, officials say",2026-02-13T22:32:02.445Z,No Author Listed,"Two immigration agents may have made ""untruthful statements"" in sworn testimony about the shooting of a migrant in Minneapolis last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has said.
ICE acting director Todd Lyons said the two officers, who have not been named, were immediately placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation.
""Lying under oath is a serious federal offence,"" Lyons said. On Friday, a judge granted a request to drop charges against two men who were accused of attacking the officers.
The Department of Homeland Security initially said a federal officer shot a man in the leg after being attacked with a shovel and broom handle by three migrants on 14 January.
Lyons said in a statement on Friday that the two officers appeared to have provided inaccurate testimony and that the US attorney's office was actively investigating the matter.
""Video evidence has revealed that sworn testimony provided by two separate officers appears to have made untruthful statements,"" he said.
""Upon conclusion of the investigation, the officers may face termination of employment, as well as potential criminal prosecution.""
After the 14 January incident, the DHS issued a statement saying the shooting happened after a car chase involving a Venezuelan national who was in the country illegally. After the pursuit, the man got out of his car and an altercation broke out between him and the federal agent, it added.
""While the subject and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and also attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,"" the agency had claimed.
""As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broom stick.""
The DHS statement went on to say: ""Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots."" The three people then ran into an apartment and were later all arrested, the DHS said.
Shortly after the incident, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said an agent was ""beat up, he's bruised, he is injured, he's getting treatment, and we're thankful that he made it out alive"".
It was soon followed by a statement on X from US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said: ""Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It's disgusting.""
Two men, Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, were charged with forcibly assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers in the performance of their official duties.
From the outset, the official account of the incident was inconsistent. DHS said it was Sosa-Celis who was driving the car then fled on foot but an FBI affidavit said it was Aljorna, the BBC's US partner CBS News reports.
The DHS also scaled back an earlier claim that three people had attacked the immigration agent, as charging documents later stated there were only two individuals involved.
Sosa-Celis was shot in the leg during the incident.
On Thursday, in an extraordinary reversal, Minnesota's top federal prosecutor Daniel N Rosen asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Aljorna and Sosa-Celis, saying that ""newly discovered evidence in this matter is materially inconsistent with the allegations"".
The US attorney wrote that, as a result, dismissing the case with prejudice - meaning it cannot be refiled - ""will serve the interests of justice"".
A judge granted the request on Friday and dismissed the case.
Frederick Goetz, a lawyer representing Aljorna, said he was ""delighted"" by the decision to dismiss the charges with prejudice.
""It is my understanding that the video surveillance evidence that captured the incident was materially inconsistent with the federal agent's claims of what happened,"" Goetz said in a statement to CBS News, adding that ""the agent's claims of being assaulted were not backed up by the video evidence"".
Sosa-Celis' lawyer Robin Wolpert said his client was ""a crime victim"".
""These untruthful statements had serious consequences for my client and his family,"" he said.
A third Venezuelan man, Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez Ledezma, who lived nearby, was also arrested after the 14 January incident, but a court filing shows he was taken to an ICE detention facility in Texas, and was later returned to Minnesota and released by order of a federal judge.
On Thursday, Trump's border tsar Tom Homan announced that the enforcement surge in Minnesota will end after more than two months.
More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants were arrested during the campaign, he said.

Don Lemon pleads not guilty in Minnesota church protest case,2026-02-13T20:53:59.099Z," Madeline Halpert
","Former CNN host Don Lemon has pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from his coverage of a protest last month at a church over federal immigration raids in the US state of Minnesota.
Lemon, 59, was charged with conspiracy to deprive rights and interfering with religious freedoms by allegedly obstructing someone's First Amendment rights by force.
He was arrested after entering the Cities Church in St Paul on 18 January with protesters who said one of its pastors was an immigration enforcement official.
He livestreamed the protest in an incident that resulted in charges for eight other people.
Lemon did not speak as he entered the courtroom on Friday in St Paul, where two dozen protesters were gathered to support him, chanting ""[Attorney General] Pam Bondi has got to go"", according to the Associated Press.
Four co-defendants who were there with Lemon also pleaded not guilty.
Lemon has defended his decision to enter the church, saying he was simply carrying out his duty as an independent journalist covering a protest.
""I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,"" he said soon after he was arrested.
During Friday's hearing, one of Lemon's lawyers, Abbe Lowell, expressed concerns to the judge that investigators had taken Lemon's mobile phone when they arrested him in Los Angeles late last month, according to US media.
Lemon and eight other co-defendants, including another journalist, have been charged with conspiracy against religious freedom at a place of worship and injuring, intimidating and interfering with the exercise of the right of religious freedom at a place of worship.
In the 18 January incident, protesters interrupted a service the church by chanting ""ICE out"" and ""Justice for Renee Good"", the mother of three who was fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last month in Minneapolis. Lemon has said he was there as a journalist and not affiliated with the church protestors.
Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other.
Federal agents killed a second protester, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis two weeks later. Both Pretti and Good were killed as they were protesting against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota, an operation that has since ended.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a social media post after Lemon's arrest that ""Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship"".
A longstanding Trump critic, Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 after 17 years with the broadcaster. The morning show host had apologised for on-air comments that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, then 51, was past her prime.

Trump administration sues Harvard over data on race in admissions,2026-02-13T19:27:14.237Z," Brandon Drenon
","The Trump administration is suing Harvard University for alleged failures to comply with a US Department of Justice civil rights investigation.
The lawsuit accuses Harvard of not disclosing data needed to determine whether it had illegally considered race in its admissions process.
""Providing requested data is a basic expectation of any credible compliance process,"" the justice department's civil rights head, Harmeet Dhillon, said in a press release on Friday.
Harvard said in a statement to the BBC that it had been ""responding to the government's inquiries in good faith and continues to be willing to engage with the government according to the process required by law"".
The university also said it ""refused to surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights in response to unlawful government overreach"".
The lawsuit comes after US President Donald Trump said his administration will be seeking $1bn (£730m) in damages from Harvard amid an ongoing feud over alleged ""woke"" policies.
Filed in US District Court in Massachusetts on Thursday, the lawsuit alleges that by ""unlawfully withholding"" data, Harvard violated a section of the US Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination based on race.
It follows a 2023 US Supreme Court ruling that found race-conscious college admissions programs were unconstitutional.
According to the complaint: ""Harvard repeatedly slow-walked the pace of production and refused to produce pertinent data.""
The lawsuit alleges that Harvard also failed to provide ""sufficient"" material for review, including individualised applicant admissions data and correspondence related to race and ethnicity, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion.
By failing to comply, the government says Harvard also ""breached a material term of DOJ federal financial assistance"".
The government notes in its complaint that it ""does not accuse Harvard of any discriminatory conduct"" and is not seeking monetary damages or to revoke federal funding.
The lawsuit asks the court to issue an injunction requiring Harvard to release the requested documents and to comply with future document requests.
Harvard said it had made changes to admissions procedures after the 2023 Supreme Court ruling.
The university said admissions staff who reviewed applications did not have access to applicants' answers to questions about race and ethnicity until after the admissions process had finished.
It also instructs alumni vounteers who interview applicants not to ask about or consider an applicant's race, Harvard said.
The lawsuit filed on Thursday marks the latest clash in an ongoing legal battle between the university and the Trump administration.
In April last year, Trump revoked around $2bn in research grants and froze federal funding for Harvard.
The university sued the Trump administration over the move, saying no government ""should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue"".
A federal court overturned the billions in funding cuts, ruling the government had violated the university's free speech rights.
The White House vowed to immediately challenge the ""egregious decision"", saying Harvard remained ""ineligible for grants in the future"".
The government had engaged in discussions with Harvard about unfreezing funding before Trump announced earlier this month that he would be seeking $1bn in damages from the university.
Trump has previously threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status and take control of the university's patents stemming from federally funded research.
Three other Ivy League universities - Columbia, Penn and Brown - struck deals with Trump to preserve federal funding.

Six possible effects of Trump's climate policy change,2026-02-13T19:08:07.689Z," Michael Sheils McNamee
","US President Donald Trump has announced the reversal of the so-called endangerment finding, a key Obama-era scientific ruling that underpins much of US environmental legislation.
As a result of this, experts are predicting various environmental and economic impacts, though the decision by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to be challenged in the courts from environmental groups.
Here are some of the potential impacts.
The most obvious outcome of the legislative change is that there will be fewer restrictions placed on greenhouse-gas-producing industries - in particular vehicle manufacturers.
The 2009 endangerment finding was the result of a major report by the EPA, which identified six greenhouse gases, including carbon monoxide and methane, as endangering current and future generations.
The EPA produced the report after a 2007 US Supreme Court decision that it was responsible for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act - with the court ruling it was ""without a doubt"" that these gases counted as air pollutants.
Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, raising temperatures.
The impact of the ruling until now has been notable. Greenhouse gas levels in the US peaked in the late 2000s and have been on a steady decline in the years since.
With the endangerment finding gone, so is much of the legal basis limiting US industries in the amount of greenhouse gases they are allowed to emit.
Non-profit group the Environmental Defense Fund estimates that there will be an additional 7.5-18 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases - three times the amount emitted in a year at present - emitted by 2055.
The effect of this, the group contends, would come at a cost that could potentially run into the trillions of dollars.
While there has already been a backlash from environmental groups, the Trump administration says removing the endangerment finding will be economically beneficial - particularly when it comes to the cost of vehicles.
Reversing the finding will reduce automobile manufacturers' costs by around $2,400 (£1,760) per car, the White House claimed.
Since 2009, the endangerment finding has opened the door to government policies that have boosted fuel efficiency and the number of electric cars on the road. A key policy of Trump's predecessor Joe Biden was the Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivised electric vehicle ownership and renewable energy projects.
Since returning to the White House, a number of these policies have already been scrapped by Trump.
Thursday's change has been welcomed by some in the motor industry.
Manufacturer Ford told CNBC it would help to address ""the imbalance between current emissions standards and customer choice"", while industry body the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said it would help to ""correct some of the unachievable emissions regulations enacted under the previous administration"".
However, with climate targets still applicable in many international markets, there are doubts about how much car manufacturers will change production.
""This rollback is sort of cementing things that have already been done, such as the relaxation of the fuel economy standards,"" said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert from Columbia University.
""But it really does put the US automakers in a bind, because nobody else is going to want to buy American cars.""
As a result of the endangerment finding, a 2011 US Supreme Court ruling placed the power for regulating greenhouse gas emissions with the EPA, taking it out of the hands of the court system.
With the finding gone, legal experts are predicting this will now unravel, leading to a surge in what are called ""public nuisance"" actions.
A public nuisance is anything that interferes with the rights of the public - but in environmental cases, it generally refers to something that would interfere with the health and safety of a community.
Prior to the 2011 ruling, various court cases were brought by several US states against alleged corporate polluters seeking compensation for that pollution.
So US companies could once again face such legal action.
""This may be another classic case where overreach by the Trump administration comes back to bite it,"" said Robert Percival, a University of Maryland environmental law professor.
Announcing the end of the endangerment findings, the EPA stated that maintaining greenhouse gas emissions standards was not a requirement to fulfil its ""core mission of protecting human health and the environment"".
But scientists consistently say that pollutants, including greenhouse gases, can cause health problems and premature deaths.
The Environmental Defense Fund estimates that, by 2055, the increase in emissions could lead to between 15,400 and 58,000 premature deaths.
It also estimated that, over the same period, there could potentially be tens of millions more asthma attacks, and tens of thousands more hospital visits.
While the White House has pointed to the potential savings from removing greenhouse gas restrictions for the automotive industry, Thursday's announcement raises questions about how the US will continue to perform in the global race for renewable energy.
The Biden administration had promoted policies that incentivised domestic renewable technology development, in the hope of the US remaining competitive.
""While the US retreats from clean vehicle standards, the rest of the world is accelerating, and American automakers are falling behind,"" said Margo T Oge, a former head of the EPA, who was in post when the endangerment finding was brought in.
She pointed to a major uptick in the market share for electric vehicles produced by EU and Chinese companies in the past few years.
""If the US abandons its standards, we aren't 'saving' the American auto industry; we are leaving it on an island of obsolete technology,"" Oge wrote in Forbes.
This was a point also made by former US Secretary of State John Kerry.
""China is now producing more wind, more solar than all of the rest of the world put together,"" he said.
""That's what they're doing, they're deploying it. Do you think they've taken a stupid pill or something yesterday and decided to change their entire economy to meet this new standard?
""No, their population wants clean air.""
Despite the argument that the US could lose ground in terms of renewable energy innovation, the Trump administration points to the economic strain created by regulation.
Announcing the change on Thursday, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin described it as ""the single largest deregulatory action in US history"" - and said the action was ""saving American taxpayers over $1.3 trillion [£950bn]"".
Diana Furchtgott-Roth, who served in the US Department of Transportation during Trump's first term, told the BBC that regulations on emissions had created higher prices and resulted in manufacturing leaving the country.
""It's gone to China, where it's made in a dirtier way,"" she told the BBC.
""So to say that we're reducing global emissions by ending energy intensive manufacturing in some countries, then having it go to China and India, where it's made in a dirtier way, does not reduce global emissions.""
But Kerry, who also served as US special envoy for climate, said the decision to do away with the endangerment rule will invite enormous damage to people and property all around the world, as climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and severe.
""It's very clear the administration is trading facts and trading science for denial and the wilful negligence that will cost lives and health and countless taxpayers dollars.""

Top Goldman Sachs lawyer who called Epstein 'Uncle Jeffrey' resigns,2026-02-13T17:10:45.836Z," Max Matza
","Goldman Sachs' top lawyer, Kathryn Ruemmler, has announced she will step down from her role after months of pressure over her friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Emails disclosed by the US justice department show she referred to the disgraced financier in emails as ""Uncle Jeffrey"", advised him on how to push back against media and accepted luxury gifts from him.
""My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,"" Ruemmler, who previously served as White House counsel to former US President Barack Obama, said in a statement.
Goldman CEO David Solomon thanked her for ""sound advice"". Her resignation will take effect from 30 June.
""Throughout her tenure, Kathy has been an extraordinary general counsel, and we are grateful for her contributions,"" Solomon said in a statement.
""Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision.""
There is no suggestion that appearing in the millions of documents related to Epstein that have been released in the US implies any criminal wrongdoing.
But the drip of revelations became a public relations headache for the Wall Street bank, where Ruemmler led its reputational risk committee. She joined Goldman in 2020.
Ruemmler said in a statement to news agency Reuters earlier this month: ""I got to know him [Epstein] as a lawyer and that was the foundation of my relationship with him.
""I had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part, and I did not know him as the monster he has been revealed to be.""
The BBC has contacted Ruemmler for comment.
Emails show she had a large number of communications with Epstein between 2014 and 2019, when she was in private practice after leaving the White House.
Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child and died while in custody facing sex trafficking charges in 2019.
In one December 2015 email exchange, Ruemmler wrote to a redacted recipient. ""I adore him [Epstein]. It's like having another older brother!""
That message came after Epstein offered to buy her a first-class ticket to Europe, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS.
Her exit from Goldman follows the release of handwritten notes from a law enforcement official who participated in Epstein's sex trafficking arrest in July 2019.
The notes suggest that, on the night he was taken into custody, Epstein called Ruemmler, whose mobile phone number is redacted in the documents.
She has said she never represented Epstein as a legal client.
Communications from March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, show Ruemmler advising him on how to push back against media scrutiny that his 2008 plea deal was too lenient.
""Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offences] of sexual solicitation,"" Ruemmler wrote.
She suggests arguing that Epstein was being persecuted due to his ""wealth"".
The emails also show that Epstein lavished Ruemmler with gifts, including flowers, wine, a Hermès bag, $10,000 (£7,300) in Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and an Apple watch.
""Am totally tricked out by Uncle Jeffrey today! Jeffrey boots, handbag, and watch!"" Ruemmler wrote in a 2019 message.
Last month, a Goldman spokesman played down the gifts, saying: ""It's well known that Epstein often offered unsolicited favours and gifts to his many business contacts.""
Ruemmler's departure is the latest corporate resignation linked to the latest Epstein disclosures.
Last week, Brad Karp, the chairman of prestigious US law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down after emails revealed he discussed Epstein's 2008 conviction with him.

"Who were the victims of the shootings in Tumbler Ridge, Canada?",2026-02-13T12:57:04.097Z," Caitlin Wilson
","Eight people were killed in two shootings - at a school and at a home - in the Canadian Rockies town of Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, this week.
Another 27 people were injured, meaning many residents in the rural community of just 3,000 people will know someone who was a casualty of Tuesday's attacks.
Here is what we know about the victims.
The mother of 18-year-old shooting suspect Jesse Van Rootselaar is among the victims. Jennifer Jacobs, 39, who was also known as Jennifer Strang, was one of two of Van Rootselaar's family members found dead at a local residence, British Columbia's Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said.
Van Rootselaar was found dead on the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.
Court documents related to a family dispute from 2015 show that Jacobs and her children had spent years travelling around Canada, with a judge saying the family led ""an almost nomadic life"", moving between ""Newfoundland, Grand Cache and Powell River, British Columbia"" over five years.
She was then ordered to return with the children to British Columbia.
Van Rootselaar's 11-year-old step-brother, Emmett Jacobs, was also killed at the residence, the RCMP confirmed.

Among the victims killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School was 12-year-old Kylie Smith, the RCMP confirmed on Thursday.
""Kylie was the light in our family. She loved her family, friends, and going to school,"" her family said in a tribute shared by the police.
""She was a talented artist and had dreams of going to art school in the big city of Toronto,"" the statement said.
""Rest in paradise, sweet girl, our family will never be the same without you.""
Abel Mwansa, who was 12, is being remembered for his beautiful smile and love of science.
He was also a great soccer player who always gave it his all on the pitch and was ready to jump in and help his teammates, his coach Tyler Curry told Global News.
His father, a pastor, wrote on social media: ""If I had power to give life I would have brought you back to life together with others that where killed alongside you but son my power is limited, and seeing your child murdered at this age is heart breaking.""
He told CBC News that his son was ""ambitious"" and had a genuine smile, which he often flashed.
Zoey Benoit, 12, was killed at the secondary school, the RCMP confirmed.
""She was so resilient, vibrant, smart, caring and the strongest little girl you could meet,"" Benoit's family said in a statement shared by the police.
""She brought so much laughter and smiles in her presence. She loved spending time with her family where she could show her love. Our family is devastated by this loss, but we will cherish her memories with us so close to our hearts forever.""
""She will forever be loved and never forgotten. We miss you beautiful girl, Zoey we love you so much,"" the statement said.
Shannda Aviugana-Durand, a 39-year-old, was also killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, the RCMP confirmed.
In a statement on social media, the BC General Employees Union (BCGEU) posted a tribute to Aviugana-Durand who was an educator.
""We are grieving the profound loss of one of our union members whose life was taken in this terrible event. Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39, was a member of the BCGEU and worked at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School,"" the statement said.
""We extend our deepest condolences to the family, friends, coworkers, and all those whose lives she touched.""
Ticaria Lampert was just two months away from her 13th birthday, when she was shot and killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, her mother said during a news conference on Thursday.
""Our family is shattered,"" Sarah Lampert said. ""It is going to take an immense amount of time to get through this.
""Simple things like going and getting in the van and turning around and not having a full headcount is going to be hard,"" she continued. ""Everything is hard right now.""
Lampert said she was a single-mother and called her daughter the ""family hero"", ""the glue"" that kept everyone together.
""I called her my tiki torch. She's always been a blazing light in the darkness and if you didn't manage to see her, you would definitely hear her,"" Lampert said.
Ezekiel Schofield also died in the school attack, aged 13, is being remembered as an avid ice hockey player.
His grandfather, Peter Schofield, mourned the boy's loss through words shared in a Facebook post.
""Everything feels so surreal. The tears just keep flowing,"" Schofield said.
""So many young lives were ended so needlessly. Our hearts are broken not only for Ezekiel, but for every family affected by this tragedy.""
He expressed gratitude for the ""outpouring of love"", and said ""your messages, prayers, and support mean more to us than words can express"".
Two children were also badly injured in the attack, including Maya Gebala, her family says.
The 12-year-old was airlifted to a children's hospital in Vancouver.
Her daughter ""is fighting for her life"" her mother, Cia Edmonds, posted on social media on Tuesday, saying she was wounded in her head and neck.
She asked for prayers for her daughter.
Her aunt told Global News that Maya is outgoing and loves sports, especially ice hockey.

'Everyone knows somebody affected' - small Canadian town united in grief after mass shooting,2026-02-13T10:45:22.110Z," Nadine Yousif
Senior Canada reporter
in Tumbler Ridge
British Columbia
","In the small town of Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, residents are reeling after a mass shooting left nine people dead, including six children.
""We've been insulated,"" Tracy Krauss, a local pastor, told the BBC. ""A newcomer comes to town and they're locking up, and everyone laughs, because why are you doing that? Nothing happens here.""
Krauss said that sense of security now feels painfully naïve.
On Thursday, police released the identities of the victims. They include 12-year-old Zoey Benoit, who was described by loved ones as ""the strongest little girl you could meet"".
Another 12-year-old victim, Kylie Smith, was ""the light"" of her family who had dreams of attending art school in the big city, her family said in a statement.
The tragedy has shaken the tight-knit town of about 2,400 people, which is set along a few winding rural roads in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.
A memorial beside the school grew on Thursday, as people left flowers, teddy bears and handwritten notes in honour of the victims.
Tuesday's incident is one of the deadliest mass shootings in Canada, where such attacks have historically been rare.
Support has poured in from across the country, including from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is scheduled to visit the town on Friday.
Many questions remain about the shooting, with investigators still trying to determine why 18-year-old suspect Jesse Van Rootselaar carried out the attack.
Van Rootselaar was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the school. Police say Van Rootselaar was born a biological male and began transitioning to being female approximately six years ago.
The suspect's mother and step-brother were among the victims. Both were found dead at a local residence, police said.
Krauss said Van Rootselaar's family were well-known in the community. ""That family is victimised, too,"" she added, noting that surviving relatives would also be grieving.
The father of the suspect issued a statement on Wednesday night to CBC News in which he offered sympathy to the bereaved and said he was estranged from the suspect.
""To the families who have lost loved ones, and to every person who has been affected by this senseless and unforgivable act of violence, I offer my most heartfelt condolences,"" said Justin Van Rootselaar.
Police have said the suspect's mother and step-brother were shot and killed at the family home first.
The suspect then headed to Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, where police responded to reports of a shooting at around 13:30 local time (21:30 GMT) on Tuesday.
Inside the school of 160 students, dozens sheltered in classrooms with their teachers as the attack unfolded. Among them was 17-year-old Darian Quist.
Quist said he and 15 others hid in their mechanics class, barricading the door with metal tables. At first, they were unsure why they needed to hide, he said. They later learned that there was an active shooter through an alert on their phones.
They hid for over two hours before Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and SWAT officers safely escorted them out.
Quist said the shooting had left him and his classmates angry, saddened and shocked. ""That it happened in a place like this, it doesn't seem real,"" he said.
""But I know that it is,"" he added, ""that the people who lost their lives are real.""
Outside the school, parents gathered at a nearby community centre as they anxiously waited to be reunited with their children. Krauss, the pastor, said she went over to support a close friend whose son was at the school.
Krauss said her friend later learned that their child was among those who were killed.
""It was devastating, I don't know what else to say,"" she said through tears. ""They are gutted. To lose a child is the worst thing in the world.""
Krauss added that everyone in the town had been touched by the shooting in some way. ""Everybody knows somebody,"" she said. ""Even for those who haven't lost a loved one, they are still affected.""
Tumbler Ridge's history is rooted in mining, with the industry still employing many of the town's residents. It is also known for its picturesque scenery, with tourists drawn to its Unesco-recognised geopark - one of only five in Canada.
That natural beauty is how Bob Zimmer, the federal Conservative member of parliament representing the region, hopes Tumbler Ridge will be remembered, rather than for the tragedy that struck it this week.
""They want to be defined as a beautiful community with beautiful people,"" Zimmer told the BBC. ""But for now, there's a dark cloud. It's just going to take some time to mourn.""
Police said they had responded to multiple mental health calls involving Van Rootselaar over the years and had seized firearms from the suspect's home before, though they were later returned after a successful petition by the owner.
Authorities did not say who had owned the previously seized guns, nor how the suspect procured the weapons used in the shooting. They said Van Rootselaar had a gun licence that had expired in 2024.
Zimmer acknowledged that there will be difficult conversations in the aftermath of the shooting, including on whether there is an ""obvious need for more substantial mental health support"".
But for now, he said the community was focused on grieving.
""We're just here to give some hugs and tell [residents] that they are appreciated, and that there's hope,"" Zimmer said.
""But I think there are some serious questions that need to be answered after this.""

FBI releases description of suspect in Nancy Guthrie kidnapping,2026-02-13T10:06:38.058Z," Michael Sheils McNamee
","The FBI has released the first physical description of the man believed to have kidnapped Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, disappeared in the middle of night from her Tucson, Arizona home and was last seen two weeks ago. The authorities believe she was taken against her will.
The FBI has analysed footage from a doorbell camera outside her home and believes she was kidnapped by a male who is between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall with an average build.
It is first time the man in the video has been officially identified as a suspect in the case, which has drawn a huge amount of attention both in the US and abroad.
The FBI said in its latest statement that it had been able to establish identifying details after carrying out a forensic analysis.
It highlighted the backpack being worn by the suspect in the video, which was released earlier this week and identified it is a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.
A pair of black gloves has also been found during the search for Guthrie, the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS reported on Thursday.
Nancy Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January when family members dropped her home. Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.
Officials have warned that she may be in dire health without her medication. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said she was ""not in good physical health"" but had no reported cognitive issues.
Since 1 February, the FBI said it had received more than 13,000 tips in relation to the case - including 4,000 in the 24 hours after the doorbell camera footage was released.
It has now doubled the reward for information about Guthrie's disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.
Earlier this week, a man was detained in connection with Guthrie's disappearance and his home in Rio Rico - south of Tucson - was searched before he was released.
He told reporters he did not know who Nancy Guthrie was.
Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's potential abductors.
They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her return.

Tumbler Ridge mass shooting: What we know so far,2026-02-13T03:23:14.782Z," Jaroslav Lukiv
","Canadian police say eight people have been killed in a mass shooting at a school and home in the remote rural community of Tumbler Ridge in the western province of British Columbia.
Six people were killed and at least 25 others were injured at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. The suspect, 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, was found dead at that scene from a self-inflicted gunshot injury, police said.
Two others - the suspect's mother, 39, and step-brother, 11 - were also found dead at a nearby home.
This is what we know so far about one of the deadliest gun attacks in Canada's history.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said they received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School at 13:30 local time on Tuesday (20:30 GMT).
The police responded by deploying officers to the scene, and issuing an active shooter alert for the rural community and a surrounding area.
""Shelter in place, lock your doors and refrain from leaving your home or business at this time"" local residents were told.
British Columbia's Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Nina Krieger said police officers arrived at Tumbler Ridge Secondary school ""within two minutes"" of receiving the call of an active shooting.
She said such a swift response ""no doubt"" saved lives.
Police said they were called at around 13:47 local time to the incident at the house.
The incident at the home occurred first, then the suspect went to the school, officials said.
The motive for the attack is not yet known.
Tumbler Ridge has about 2,400 residents, and its secondary school has 160 students in Grades 7-12.
Six people were killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, including a 39-year-old female educator, three female students, all aged 12, and two male students, one aged 12 and the other 13.
On Thursday, the RCMP identified all the deceased victims.
They include 12-year-old Kylie Smith, whose father told Canada's CTV that she ""was just a beautiful soul"" who loved art and anime.
Abel Mwansa, who was 12, was also killed at the school and was remembered for his beautiful smile and love of science.
The suspect's mother, Jennifer Jacobs, 39, and step-brother, Emmett Jacobs, 11, were found dead at a nearby home.
The majority of the 25 others who were injured did not sustain gunshot wounds, police said.
Police identified the suspect as 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, a former student who had dropped out four years ago.
Van Rootselaar was found dead inside the school with a self-inflicted injury following the shootings.
Authorities said that the former student was born a biological male but identified as a woman.
""I can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who approximately six years ago began to transition to female,"" Dwayne McDonald, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner, told reporters.
McDonald said police had attended Van Rootselaar's home on multiple occasions over the past several years, with some calls related to mental health concerns. Police were last in contact with Van Rootselaar sometime last year, he added.
The suspect previously had a valid gun licence that had since lapsed, McDonald said.
The RCMP also said there had been guns in Van Rootselaar the suspect's home that had been seized by police about two years ago.
Someone in the family later successfully petitioned to get the firearms back.
Authorities found two firearms - a long gun and a modified handgun - at the scene, though they said they do not know how Van Rootselaar procured the weapons used in Tuesday's shootings.
Darian Quist, a Grade 12 student at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, and his mother Shelley Quist, spoke to CBC Radio West host Sarah Penton about what happened.
Darian said shortly after he got to his class at 13:30 local time, an alarm sounded in the hallways with instructions to close the doors because of a lockdown.
He said the doors were closed for a while, when he and his classmates realised something was wrong.
He said he was receiving photos on his phone from the scene.
""We got tables and barricaded the doors"" for over two hours, Darian said, until police arrived to escort them out of the school.
Once outside, he reunited with his mother at a nearby community centre.
Shelley Quist said that on her phone she had earlier heard police ""kicking"" her son's classroom door down and several students being escorted out of the school.
""That's when I left home. We live very close; a block away from the community centre. I literally almost ran over there,"" she told CBC.
Tumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka told CBC that the community is small and tight-knit, and that he expected the victims to all be people he knows.
""I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,"" he said, after emerging from the town hall when the shelter-in-place order was lifted.
""I don't call them residents. I call them family.""
Tumbler Ridge town councillor Chris Norbury told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the whole community was in shock after the shootings.
""We don't lock our doors here. It is an incredibly safe community... we don't have to worry about crime here,"" he said, speaking live from the scene.
""This is a big tragedy here,"" he said.
The councillor described going to the secondary school and seeing emergency services blocking the entrance.
""We have three police vehicles in our town, we are very small. We are a small community. We know each other, we all know the victims. They are our friends, our friends' children.""
British Columbia Premier David Eby described the shootings as ""a devastating and unimaginable tragedy"".
""We can't imagine what the community is going through. But I know it's causing us to all hug our kids a little bit tighter tonight,"" he said.
The province declared a day of mourning on Thursday, and members of Parliament in Ottawa held a minute of silence on Wednesday for the victims.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has decided to suspend a planned trip to Germany, and in emotional remarks, and lamented the ""difficult day"" - the first of many in the aftermath of the attack.
""The nation mourns with you. Canada stands by you,"" he said.
""We will get through this. But right now it is a time to come together, like Canadians do in these terrible situations. To support each other, to mourn together and to grow together.""
The rural community is located about 670km (415 miles) north-east of Vancouver.
It is primarily known for its coal mines, and also the discovery of dinosaur fossils - with Tumbler Ridge marketing itself as the land of dinosaurs and waterfalls to attract tourists.
In Canada, gun ownership is largely federally regulated - by the national government - and there are stricter gun laws than in most US states.
Under the country's Firearms Act, guns must be kept locked and unloaded. Anyone wishing to buy a firearm is also subject to extensive background checks.
A national freeze on private ownership of all short-barrelled firearms has also been in place in Canada since 2022. In January, the government began a national gun buy-back programme, launched in response to a mass shooting in Nova Scotia in 2020 where 22 people were killed.
That said, there a number of people across the country who own guns - particularly in rural areas.
According to a Canadian website on gun ownership, which obtained statistics from the RCMP, there were 355,678 gun licences in British Columbia as of 2023, or about 6,240 gun licenses per 100,000 people. But the website cautioned that many people own guns without a licence, which is illegal.

"Costs from Trump's tariffs paid mainly by US firms and consumers, NY Fed says",2026-02-13T01:07:59.270Z," Kali Hays
BBC News
","As President Donald Trump changed tariff agreements with a number of countries, there was one constant: goods became more expensive for US companies and consumers.
In research released Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a group of analysts and economists found that in 2025, the average tariff rate on imported goods rose to 13% from just 2.6% at the start of the year.
The New York Fed found that 90% of the cost of increased tariffs, which Trump imposed on goods from Mexico, China, Canada and the European Union, was paid for by US companies.
""US firms and consumers continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025.""
As tariff rates changed and increased last year, exporting countries did not lower the cost of goods in an attempt to ward off any drop in US demand.
Instead, exporters kept their prices the same, passing off the cost of tariffs to any company importing their goods, which in turn responded by increasing the price of those goods to shoppers.
The reaction from exporters in 2025 was essentially the same in 2018, when Trump imposed certain tariffs during his first term in office – the cost of goods for consumers rose, with little other economic impact recorded, the New York Fed said at the time.
Its Thursday findings match research from other recent analyses.
The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, an independent research firm in Germany, said in a report last month that it had found ""near-complete pass-through of tariffs to US import prices.""
Kiel researchers analysed 25 million transactions and found that in exporting countries like Brazil and India, the price of goods from those countries did not decline.
""Trade volumes collapsed instead,"" the Kiel report said, meaning exporters preferred to cut the amount of goods being shipped into the US rather than lower prices.
The National Bureau of Economic Research also found that the pass-through of tariffs was ""almost 100%"", meaning the US is paying for the increase in prices, not exporting countries.
Similarly, the Tax Foundation, a Washington DC-based think tank focused on US tax policy, found that increased tariffs on goods in 2025 increased costs for every American household.
Defining tariffs as a new tax on consumers, the Tax Foundation said the 2025 increases cost the average household $1,000 (£734.30). In 2026, tariffs will cost the same household $1,300.
The Tax Foundation said even the ""effective"" tariff rate, an average rate that takes into account people buying fewer goods in response to increased prices, is now 9.9%, making it the ""the highest average rate since 1946"".
With such impacts on people, the Tax Foundation said any economic benefits of tax cuts included in Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" will be offset entirely.

DHS shutdown looms as funding bill fails over immigration demands,2026-02-13T00:10:59.861Z," Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu
Washington
","The US Senate has failed to advance a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) amid dispute over Democratic demands to place new restrictions on immigration agents.
A procedural vote on Thursday fell short of the number required, leaving it stalled ahead of a midnight Saturday deadline.
Following the killings of two US citizens, Democrats have called for tighter oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including banning its agents from wearing masks and requiring them to use body cameras.
The lapse in funding is expected to have little impact on ICE operations. But it could hit other DHS agencies, including those in charge of disaster response and airport security.
ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies will largely continue to be funded because of legislation last year that gave billions to dollars to advance President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda.
Senate Minority Speaker Chuck Schumer said Democratic proposals, like the end of masks for agents, were ""common sense"".
""For weeks, we have been pushing common sense reforms, the very types of things that local and sheriffs throughout America routinely follow,"" Schumer said after the vote. ""Democrats will not support a blank cheque for chaos.""
Democrats also want the deal to include a ban on racial profiling, require judicial warrants before agents enter private property, and prohibit immigration enforcement at medical facilities, schools, childcare centres, churches, polling stations and courts.
The Trump administration recently announced it would begin providing body cameras for officers in Minneapolis before rolling it out to officers nationwide. But several sticking points remained in the negotiations ahead of the funding deadline.
Key among Republican demands is for a deal that would force local and state police to cooperate with federal immigration officials.
Shortly after the vote, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said other sub-agencies such as FEMA, which handles natural disaster response, and TSA, which screens passengers at airports, will be affected the most.
""Those officers that show up and check your bags, they screen individuals on if they are safe to get on aeroplanes or not, they won't be paid after Friday,"" Noem said at a news conference in California near the US-Mexico border.
She said funding to protect US infrastructure from cyber-attacks will also be impacted.
""The Democratic Party is choosing not to fund them and making us very vulnerable to those terrorists being successful here on our homeland.""
Earlier this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, said some of the proposals by Democrats are positive but said others were ""non-starters and unnecessarily tie the hands of law enforcement"".
The Senate is on a week-long recess but senators could be called back if a deal is reached in the meantime. The bill has already been passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

The US economy is growing - so where are all the jobs?,2026-02-13T00:05:12.475Z," Natalie Sherman
","When 42-year-old Jacob Trigg lost his job as a project manager in the tech industry he didn't think it would take too long to find a new one - he always had before.
But more than 2,000 job applications later he is still hunting, trying to make ends meet with jobs in package delivery and landscaping.
""It's a huge surprise because I've always been able to get a job very easily,"" said Trigg, who lives in Texas. ""It wasn't even on my radar to be prepared for more than six months of unemployment. It wasn't in my universe.""
His difficulties are an indication of a wider freeze in the US labour market, where job openings and hiring rates have dropped to multi-year lows.
Last year the US added an average of just 15,000 jobs a month, very few by historic standards.
The employment slowdown has raised concern about the health of the economy, but evidence of wider deterioration is elusive.
Layoffs have remained limited, apart from some high-profile cuts at firms such as Amazon and UPS and the unemployment rate has held steady at around 4.3%. Meanwhile, the wider economy continues to grow, expanding at a robust annual pace of 4.4% in the most recent figures.
It's a puzzling, and unusual, mix.
""It's actually very hard to point to another moment in the last 25 years where you have the combination we see today,"" said Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Trigg said he was ""battening down the hatches"" and hoping that whatever is causing the situation will pass.
But there are growing questions about whether the challenges he is facing could be here to stay.
Last October the investment bank Goldman Sachs put out a report, which was widely cited, suggesting the US could be facing a new period of ""jobless growth"" thanks to the arrival of new technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in particular, allowing companies to do more with fewer workers.
Concerns about the wider implications of such a change pulsed through discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month and have contributed to widespread economic anxiety in the US.
Economics professor Constantin Burgi of University College, Dublin, said a decoupling of job gains and wider growth - like the one the US is seeing today - often occurs when an economy goes through a structural shift, like the advent of AI.
He noted while AI's promise remains hotly debated, technology has also made outsourcing even easier.
In Burgi's view the situation is likely temporary – but that does not mean it will be short-lived.
""It can be a couple of months but it can also be a couple of years,"" he said. ""If the jobs are really lost due to outsourcing or AI, then unless we find in a couple of years actually we still need those people and replacing them didn't work, then those jobs are gone.""
For those in the trenches looking for work, the search is demoralising, regardless of its cause.
James Richardson, a 33-year-old from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said without help from his parents, he would be homeless. He has applied to more than 1,200 jobs since being let go from his role as an information security analyst for a government contractor in October.
Sometimes his application is rejected within 15 minutes of submission, he said.
""It feels like there is no-one on the other side even bothering to take a look at your experiences and credentials.""
It remains unclear whether the jobs slowdown is actually due solely or even mostly to technological change.
Research suggests job losses due to AI have remained concentrated to just a few sectors.
And many US firms, especially in tech, still have on their payrolls a glut of workers who were brought on during the pandemic, when there was a small hiring boom. That could also help explain the lack of new vacancies.
The Trump administration's crackdown on immigration is also curbing population growth. That makes it harder to find workers, but it also means fewer are needed.
Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at Indeed, said in her view another reason hiring appetites took a hit last year was the uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's cuts to government spending and his programme of tariffs.
Assuming the economy remains strong, she does not think the new jobs numbers will stay this low.
""I would definitely not call it a new normal, because I don't think it's normal,"" she said. ""I don't think you can sustain the kind of labour market that we're in over the long term.
""Having a very low-hire, low-fire, low-quits environment in a period of economic growth can only last so long.""
Stronger-than-expected job gains in January could be a sign that hope is on the horizon for job seekers.
But there are plenty of wild cards ahead, as Ullrich and others are quick to acknowledge.
As the economy grows increasingly reliant on spending by the very wealthy, it has also become more vulnerable to a sudden downward correction in share prices.
AI could prove as transformative as its most optimistic backers are predicting.
Or the US could enter a period of lower growth, if restricting immigration takes the wind out of the economy.
Amy Beson, who was laid off in April as part of wider job cuts at the University of Arizona, said she was not expecting things to improve anytime soon.
Universities have seen funding cuts from the government, making it harder for the 47-year-old to find the kind of work that used to be supported by grant programmes.
Meanwhile, she fears competition from the ranks of newly unemployed government workers.
Even expanding her search to healthcare, where she previously worked and which is considered one of the economy's most resilient sectors, has not helped.
""It definitely is the most desperate I've ever felt,"" she said. ""I do worry that this is the new normal.""

Troop who fell overboard becomes first American killed in drug boat targeting operation,2026-02-12T23:38:25.182Z," Max Matza
","A US Marine who fell overboard from an attack ship in the Caribbean has become the first known American casualty in the Trump administration's operation targeting drug-trafficking boats.
Lance Cpl Chukwuemeka E. Oforah, 21, fell from the USS Iwo Jima on 7 February and was lost at sea. He was pronounced dead after a lengthy search, which ended 10 February.
His death was announced on Wednesday and remains under investigation by the military.
The Florida native was assisting Operation Southern Spear, which has carried out 38 lethal strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean since September. It played a key role in the capture of Venezuelan president Nicholas Maduro.
A statement from the US Marines contained no details regarding how he may have fallen from the ship.
""We are all grieving alongside the Oforah family,"" said Col Tom Trimble, commanding officer of the Marine Expeditionary Unit known as Special Operations Capable.
""The loss of Lance Cp. Oforah is deeply felt across the entire Navy-Marine Corps team. He will be profoundly missed, and his dedicated service will not be forgotten.""
A news release from the military branch said the sprawling search for Oforah involved five ships and 10 aircraft.
The USS Iwo Jima was used to transport Maduro after his capture in a US raid. Maduro's capture came after weeks of a military build-up in the region, along with frequent strikes on vessels that the Trump administration said were carrying drugs headed for the US.
The pace of the strikes has notably ebbed since US forces in early January captured Maduro - who has been accused by the Trump administration of working with drug trafficking groups.
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said Operation Southern Spear is aimed at removing ""narco-terrorists from our hemisphere"" and securing the US from ""the drugs that are killing our people"".
But some legal experts have said the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process afforded to the suspects.
US officials have faced bipartisan scrutiny over a follow-up strike - or ""double-tap"" - on 2 September that targeted an alleged Venezuelan drug boat in the Caribbean Sea.
The families of two Trinidadian men killed in the 14 October strike have since filed a lawsuit against the American government, alleging the strike amounted to ""lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theatre"".

Analysis: Trump takes victory lap after biggest climate rollback yet,2026-02-12T23:12:49.690Z," Daniel Bush
Washington correspondent
","US President Donald Trump framed his sweeping rollback of federal climate change policy on Thursday as a political win over the Democratic Party's ""radical"" environmental agenda, reprising a message Republicans have used in past elections and could turn to once again ahead of November's crucial midterms.
His announcement at the White House was one of the most significant moves of his second term in office. The president said he was revoking an Obama-era ""endangerment finding"" from 2009 which held that pollution harms public health and the environment.
For almost 17 years, the US has used that scientific finding as the legal basis to establish policies to reduce emissions from cars, power plants and other sources of planet-warming gases.
""This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam,"" Trump said, using a term popular with Republicans for describing Democratic environmental and climate policies.
The move marks the culmination of a decade-long push by Trump to tear up policies that Democrats and many climate experts say are needed to rein in emissions. And it is one of the most far-reaching reversals of American climate policy yet.
Trump, who has called climate change a ""hoax"" and a ""con job"", dismissed the science underpinning the Obama-era rule in remarks that at times took on the air of a victory lap over his Democratic opponents.
It was yet another sign that, for the president, this issue is as much a political one as it is scientific.
He focused on the economic impacts of reversing the endangerment finding, arguing that boosting fossil fuels instead of clean energy would lead to lower energy costs for American consumers.
Trump also singled out the US auto industry as a major beneficiary of the change.
He said ending the endangerment finding would do away with an electric vehicle ""mandate"" put in place by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Under Biden, Congress passed a law to expand the nation's electric vehicle charging network and created tax incentives to lower the cost of EVs, but it did not include any provisions forcing buyers to purchase them.
Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency, made the announcement alongside the president and described the 2009 scientific ruling as the ""holy grail of climate change religion"".
Both men framed its revocation as an assault on overbearing federal regulations - part of a longtime message from Republicans that bureaucratic red tape is hindering economic growth.
Zeldin said past climate policies had ""strangled entire sectors of the United States economy"".
This decision is ""the single largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States of America,"" he said.
The rollback sparked fury, meanwhile, among Democrats and environmental groups who said it would wreck the US's ability to combat climate change. ""We'll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change - all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money,"" former President Barack Obama wrote on social media.
Trump reversed numerous Obama-era energy and environmental regulations in his first term in office. He also withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord, an agreement by countries around the world to lower emissions and address rising sea levels, natural disasters and other problems exacerbated by global warming.
Trump repeated the action at the start of his second term, reversing Biden's decision to reinstate the US in the international climate pact.
In recent years, climate policy in the US has swung wildly depending on who is occupying the White House. But the announcement on Thursday represented the largest move yet by Trump to dismantle the climate policies put in place by his Democratic predecessors.
It also revived a campaign trail fight from the past few national elections, which pitted Trump against Democrats in Congress who backed wide-ranging climate and environmental policies known as the ""Green New Deal"".
Whether the strategy of climate rollbacks can help Republicans pick up votes in the November midterm elections, which will decide control of Congress for the rest of Trump's term, remains to be seen.
The issue rarely appeared as a top priority for voters in exit polls in the 2024 presidential election - with the economy and cost of living frequently ranking top.
Perhaps with this in mind, Trump took pains to argue Thursday's move would save consumers thousands on a new car. Many environmentalists, however, are sceptical of this claim.
Trump and many Republicans have also argued that Democrats' climate policies are extreme and out-of-touch with public sentiment.

But opinion polls indicate a growing percentage of Americans are worried about global warming - a potential warning sign for Republicans who embrace Trump's climate record in November.
In the US, 63% of Americans say they are worried about global warming, compared to 37% who say they are not worried, according to a 2024 study by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
A 2025 Gallup poll indicated that a record 48% of American adults think global warming will pose a serious threat in their lifetime, up from 25% in 1997.
At the White House on Thursday, Trump dismissed a question about whether he was concerned his decision would be unpopular with the public. He argued that the country would be better off without the climate change regulations of the past.
That era is ""dead, gone, over"", he said.

Judge blocks US military from demoting Mark Kelly over 'illegal orders' video,2026-02-12T20:31:12.135Z," Grace Eliza Goodwin
","A federal judge has blocked Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth from lowering Senator Mark Kelly's rank in the military over his urging service members to refuse illegal orders.
US District Judge Richard Leon wrote in a scathing ruling that Hegseth had unconstitutionally retaliated against Kelly in seeking to demote the retired Navy captain.
In a post on social media, Hegseth said the judge's order would be ""immediately appealed"".
It is another setback in the Trump administration's fight against Kelly and five other lawmakers who published a video encouraging troops to disobey orders they deemed illegal. A grand jury this week declined to bring charges of seditious conspiracy against them.
Reducing Kelly's rank could lead to a major cut in his retirement pay.
Kelly, who is also a former astronaut, sued the government in January, naming Hegseth as the defendant. He argued that Hegseth had illegally tried to demote him in retaliation for criticising the Trump administration. He asked the judge to block the demotion with a temporary injunction while his lawsuit proceeded.
The federal government had argued Kelly should contest the case against him through a military process and not in a civilian court of law, but in Thursday's decision, Judge Leon wrote: ""I disagree.""
Leon wrote that while service members have more limited free speech protections than civilians under the US Constitution's first amendment, no court has ever extended those limits to retired service members.
""This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly's First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,"" he wrote. ""To say the least, our retired veterans deserve more respect from their Government, and our Constitution demands they receive it!""
Soon after the judge issued the temporary injunction, Hegseth posted on X: ""This will be immediately appealed. Sedition is sedition, 'Captain.'""
In a statement, Kelly said that he appreciated ""the judge's careful consideration of this case, and the clarity of his ruling"".
""But I also know that this might not be over yet,"" he added, saying he was ready to keep fighting the Trump administration.
In the video, the six Democratic lawmakers say that the administration ""is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens"".
Kelly appears alongside Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin and US Representatives Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow, all of whom served in military or intelligence agencies.
""Our laws are clear,"" he says. ""You can refuse illegal orders.""
After the video was released, Trump posted on social media that the members of Congress should be arrested and put on trial. Labeling the video seditious behaviour, he posted: ""PUNISHABLE BY DEATH!""
Trump later clarified to Fox News: ""I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble.""
Federal prosecutors then began criminal investigations into the lawmakers and sought to indict them on charges of seditious conspiracy. But a grand jury, which decides if a case can stand up on court, declined to approve the charges.
Meanwhile, Hegseth announced he would open retirement-grade determination proceedings against Kelly and issue a formal letter of censure. He described Kelly's comments as ""seditious in nature"" and a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
In his decision, which contained more exclamation marks than are typical in judicial writings, Leon wrote: ""Rather than trying to shrink the First Amendment liberties of retired servicemembers, Secretary Hegseth and his fellow Defendants might reflect and be grateful for the wisdom and expertise that retired servicemembers have brought to public discussions and debate on military matters in our Nation over the past 250 years.""

"Minnesota immigration enforcement surge is ending, Trump border tsar says",2026-02-12T19:47:08.182Z," Brandon Drenon
","The US immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota will end, President Donald Trump's border tsar told reporters on Thursday.
Tom Homan said Trump had approved his request to conclude the operation, adding he would stay in Minnesota ""a little longer to oversee the drawdown, to ensure its success"".
Homan said Operation Metro Surge had resulted in many illegal immigrants who had committed violent crimes being detained for deportation. But the surge also sparked nationwide protests when two US citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were killed by immigration officers.
After the news conference, top Minnesota and federal officials appeared at a Capitol Hill hearing on Trump's immigration crackdown.
Officials in Minnesota have been able to ""greatly reduce the number of targets"" for immigration enforcement, Homan said, adding that Operation Metro Surge was a ""great success"".
More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to Homan, including men he said were convicted of rape and other sexual misconduct.
Homan said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has always had a presence in Minnesota and will continue to have one.
He said that the surge's end came after an unprecedented level of cooperation between federal agents and local law enforcement, with local officials increasing their crackdown on protesters he called public safety threats and local jails more willing to notify ICE of the release dates for individuals it was seeking.
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said at a news conference following Homan's announcement that he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the drawdown of federal agents.
""The fact of the matter is they left us with deep damage, generational trauma,"" Walz said. ""They left us with economic ruin in some cases. They left us with many unanswered questions.""
The governor is expected to soon propose a $10m (£7m) emergency fund for small businesses who say they were financially hurt by the surge.
Following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti last month, President Donald Trump dispatched Homan to Minneapolis to oversee the surge, sidelining the operation's leader, Greg Bovino, who had faced intense criticism for ICE's use of force and what many in the city alleged were civil rights violations.
Trump's immigration crackdown has faced resistance in Democrat-led cities like Minneapolis from activists in the streets and local officials and immigrants in the courts. The administration last month finished removing National Guard troops from Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago - places where there had been large protests against the presence of troops and immigration agents - according to US Northern Command.
Some Republicans, too, had questioned the Minneapolis operation.
Senator Rand Paul told a committee hearing with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials on Thursday that ""saying we're going to reduce this presence in the street is a good sign and a good step forward"".
""I'm glad that's happening,"" the Republican from Kentucky said. ""I think that is de-escalation.""
ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said at the hearing that the agency is tracking roughly 1.6 million undocumented immigrants with deportation orders in the US, including roughly 800,000 who have criminal convictions.
He also defended against accusations from lawmakers that the agency was not holding officers accountable, saying ICE had launched 37 open investigations for excessive use of force since January 2025.
The fight over how immigration agents operate has now put the federal government at risk of a partial shutdown as Congress debates a funding measure for the DHS, which includes ICE.
On Thursday, the US Senate failed to advance a bill on new funding for the department. Earlier this month, lawmakers approved DHS funding for two weeks and had planned to use that time to negotiate a substantive deal.
But with no agreement in sight and the upper chamber set to go on break, DHS could lose its funding starting Saturday. That will affect a variety of services, including transportation security at US airports and responses to disasters and large-scale emergencies. Last year, lawmakers passed legislation creating a separate pool of funding that should allow ICE to continue to operate.
Democrats are demanding changes in ICE - such as ending the wearing of masks - in exchange for support for the bill. They are also pushing for immigration agents in Minnesota and elsewhere to be required to reveal their identities and to end warrant-less searches.

Canada mass shooting suspect had police visits over mental health struggles,2026-02-12T18:34:43.874Z," Ana FaguyandNadine Yousif
Senior Canada reporter
Tumbler Ridge
British Columbia
","The teenage suspect in a mass shooting in rural British Columbia had been the subject of a number of police visits in recent years because of mental health issues, authorities say.
Police say the 18-year-old - who was found dead on the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound - killed eight people, including six children, in Tuesday's attack in Tumbler Ridge.
Jesse Van Rootselaar had previously been apprehended and assessed under the Mental Health Act, and used to have a firearms licence.
It is unclear who owned the guns used in the attack, or what was the motive. Prime Minister Mark Carney has said he will visit the mountain town in the coming days.
British Columbia, in western Canada, proclaimed Thursday a day of mourning across the province.
Five students aged 12 to 13 and a 39-year-old teacher were killed and at least 25 others were injured at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School.
Two others - the suspect's mother, also 39, and 11-year-old step-brother - were found dead at a nearby home, where the attack began.
Two young victims remain in hospital in a critical but stable condition.
In Tumbler Ridge, flags remained at half-mast on Thursday, and a memorial to the victims was growing as mourners stopped by to drop off teddy bears and flowers and pause for a moment of silence.
Residents could be found hugging and comforting one another as they come to terms with what took place.
""Small towns are small towns. We look out for each other. It's not like living in a city where you don't know your neighbor,"" said Shelley Quist.
""It doesn't happen here. It doesn't happen in Canada.""
Her son, Darian Quist, 17, was in the mechanics classroom with about 15 other students when the shooting took place. They blocked the doors and remained there for about two hours, until police escorted them out.
He said he knew one of the victims, and the students are feeling ""all a little shocked, angry, sad, everything in between"".
That these attacks could happen in the first place, and ""in a place like this, just doesn't seem real"".
But he added: ""I know people who lost their lives are real.""
On Wednesday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said there was a history of visiting Van Rootselaar's family home in the past several years because of the suspect's mental health struggles.
""On different occasions the suspect was apprehended for assessment and follow up,"" said RCMP Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald.
British Columbia Premier David Eby told a news conference outside the Tumbler Ridge town hall late on Wednesday evening they were in contact with the public healthcare system officials to ""understand what interactions may have taken place"".
Van Rootselaar was born a biological male, but identified as a female, authorities said.
Tumbler Ridge has about 2,400 residents, and its secondary school, where the shooting unfolded, has 160 students. Police said Van Rootselaar had dropped out of school four years ago.
The RCMP also said there had been guns in the suspect's home, which had been seized by police about two years ago.
Someone in the family, whom police did not name, later successfully petitioned to get the firearms back.
Authorities found two firearms - a long gun and a modified handgun - on the scene, though they said they did not know how the suspect procured the weapons used in the shooting.
A 2021 Facebook post from the suspect's mother, Jennifer Strang, described how the teenager was interested in guns, BBC Verify found.
One post shared in 2021 by a relative shows the suspect holding a hunting rifle.
Court documents from a separate matter about a decade ago offer a glimpse into the suspect's upbringing.
Legal papers from a custody battle says the family led ""an almost nomadic life"" between 2010-15.
This included ""multiple moves over the last five years between Newfoundland, Grand Cache and Powell River, British Columbia"".
In a July 2024 Instagram post, the suspect's mother described herself as a ""conservative leaning libertarian"" and spoke out in support of protecting ""trans kids"".
""Do you have any idea how many kids are killing themselves over this kind of hate?"" she wrote.
On Wednesday night, hundreds of mourners gathered for a moment of silence in Tumbler Ridge's main square and outside the British Columbia legislature in Victoria.

Four takeaways from Pam Bondi's fiery Epstein testimony,2026-02-12T16:30:24.677Z," Madeline Halpert
","US Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the justice department's handling of the files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and faced a barrage of angry questions on other issues during a fiery congressional hearing on Wednesday.
Her testimony before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee descended at times into a shouting match, with Bondi at one point calling a Democrat a ""washed-up loser"". After another heated exchange, one lawmaker stormed out.
Here are some of the key exchanges from the four-hour hearing.
The hearing followed the release by the justice department earlier this year of millions more files from its investigations into the well-connected paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
Several of Epstein's victims were seated behind Bondi at the hearing, and lawmakers frequently referred to them.
In her opening statement, Bondi called Epstein a ""monster"" and told the victims she was sorry for the abuse they endured.
But lawmakers directed a litany of complaints at Bondi about how the justice department has handled its release of the files. Several criticised what they said was a failure to redact the names of victims as required by law.
Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said that in some cases ""nude images"" of survivors were released, some of whom had their identities protected ""for decades"".
Jayapal asked survivors in the room to stand and raise their hand if they had not been able to meet with the justice department, which led all of them to rise.
Jayapal then urged Bondi to apologise to the victims for the justice department's handling of redactions.
Bondi fired back, describing Jayapal's questioning as ""theatrics"" and adding: ""I'm not going to get in the gutter with this woman.""
The attorney general said at another point during the hearing that officials were doing their best to protect victims in the timeframe allotted by the legislation that required the files to be released. She said any names brought to them that have been released ""inadvertently"" have been ""immediately redacted"".
Bondi also faced questions on Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who after a meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche was moved from a ""low-security"" Florida prison to a ""minimum security"" all-women Texas prison camp.
""She needs to be moved back to a maximum security prison as soon as possible,"" one Democrat, Deborah Ross, said to Bondi.
Bondi said it was a question for the Bureau of Prisons, and she only learned about the transfer after the fact. She said Maxwell ""will hopefully die in prison"".
Marina Lacerda, an Epstein survivor who attended the hearing, told the BBC that Bondi has been unwilling to help survivors.
""She hasn't taken any of our calls. She hasn't taken any of our emails. She has totally ignored us, just like she did today,"" said Lacerda.
She also accused Bondi and the justice department of trying to ""intimidate us"" into silence.
The hearing turned tense over names in the Epstein files that had been redacted, too.
A bipartisan group of US lawmakers has accused the justice department of improperly removing the names of people from the files who are not protected.
They have been allowed to review unredacted versions of the files, which has since led the justice department to unredact names in at least one document.
Thomas Massie, a Republican who has been involved in these efforts, told Bondi he wanted to know who was responsible for the redactions and whether anybody will be held accountable for the ""failure"".
Massie went on to say that this issue is ""bigger than Watergate"" and spanned numerous US administrations.
""This is a political joke,"" Bondi said as Massie continued to press her on why some people's names, including billionaire Les Wexner, had been blacked out from the files initially.
Wexner has previously alleged that Epstein stole millions of dollars from him while working as his financial adviser.
A legal representative for Wexner told the BBC: ""The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.
""Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.""
During discussion of the Epstein files, California Democratic congressman Ted Lieu mentioned Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who is facing growing pressure from officials and the family of his prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre to testify in the US.
Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 containing no admission of liability.
Lieu had the hearing display a picture of the former prince from the Epstein files, which shows Mountbatten-Windsor on all fours hovering over a female. No context has been supplied for the photos.
It is unclear when and where they were taken and the picture itself does not indicate criminality.
Lieu asked why the photos had not been used to prosecute Mountbatten-Windsor. Bondi responded by asking why Lieu did not bring those questions to former Attorney General Merrick Garland.
""I agree with you,"" said Lieu, adding Garland ""dropped the ball"".
While the Epstein files took centre stage during the hearing, Bondi was also pressed by lawmakers on federal immigration agents fatally shooting two people during confrontations in Minneapolis, which sparked nationwide demonstrations.
Tennessee Democratic congressman Steve Cohen told Bondi the shootings were ""executions"" that the justice department did not investigate.
Bondi defended the federal government's actions in Minnesota, saying protesters and federal agents had been incited by elected officials, whom she claimed have obstructed law enforcement and declared themselves ""at war"" with the federal government.
Other Republicans joined in to defend her, including the committee chairman, congressman Jim Jordan, who praised how Bondi had implemented President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration.

The families are alleging that the online platforms are addictive by design. Lawyers for YouTube and Meta, which owns Instagram, reject the allegations.
Prince Harry expressed hope for ""truth, justice and accountability"" in footage shared exclusively with BBC Breakfast.
His remarks come after the prince launched a campaign for stronger protections for children from the dangers of social media last year.
""We've said time and time again that this is a David versus Goliath situation,"" the prince told the bereaved families, who had gathered on Wednesday evening following the day's court proceedings.
""I've been in some similar situations myself - vastly different - but when you're sitting in court and if you have that feeling of just overwhelming emotion, because you can't believe that the people on the other side are saying what they're saying - that by the very nature of defending what they're defending, the lies that they are stating, is devaluing life, is devaluing your children's lives - if that brings stuff up for you, it is totally normal,"" he said.
""None of you should be here,"" Harry said with an audible warble to his voice.
""Thank you for doing everything that you've done. Thank you for telling your stories over and over again. Truth, justice and accountability: those are the three things that will come from this.""
Ellen Roome, who believes her 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong, travelled to the US to support the case.
She told BBC Breakfast that she was among the roughly 50 bereaved parents who were addressed by the prince on Wednesday.
""We can't make a difference for our children, but we can make a difference for other people's children,"" she said.
Roome told the programme the trial was ""the first of its kind"" and that ""the world is waking up"" to the danger that ""harmful"" social media content can pose to young people.
The case would force the tech giants to take ""accountability"", she said, adding that she thought ""these companies are a law unto their own"".
The BBC has approached YouTube and Meta for comment.
A spokesperson for Meta told the BBC the company ""strongly"" disagreed with the allegations made in the legal case, adding it had introduced ""teen accounts"" with ""built-in protections"" that give parents ""tools to manage their teens' experiences"".
YouTube also has various features to limit content for younger users.
The outcome of the case brought in California may also affect separate cases brought by attorneys for dozens of US states seeking tougher restrictions on Meta platforms.

Police identify 18-year-old as suspect in Tumbler Ridge shooting,2026-02-12T09:11:04.701Z," Ana Faguy
","An 18-year-old has been named as the suspect in a shooting that killed eight people and injured dozens more in British Columbia, Canada.
Police said Jesse Van Rootselaar was found dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot injury. The motive for the attack is not yet known.
Six people were killed and at least 25 others were injured at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Two others - the suspect's mother, 39, and step-brother, 11 - were found dead at a nearby home.
Hundreds of mourners gathered to exchange comfort and moments of silence in Tumbler Ridge's main square and outside the British Columbia legislature in Victoria on Wednesday night.
""Schools should be safe,"" said Tumbler Ridge vigil attendee Gigi Rejano said, according to the AFP news agency, while others cried nearby and pictures of victims were laid near a tree.
In Victoria, speaker of the legislature Raj Chouhan said, ""We can only pray together, hold hands together and send our love to all those people"", according to a local journalist.
The shooting at the nearby home occurred first, then the suspect went to the school, McDonald said.
The victims at the school were a 39-year-old female educator, three female students, all aged 12, and two male students, one aged 12 and the other 13.
Authorities do not believe there are other suspects involved in the shootings.
Police said they had attended the suspect's family home on multiple occasions over the past several years, with some calls related to mental health concerns.
Authorities said Van Rootselaar was born a biological male but identified as a woman.
""I can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who approximately six years ago began to transition to female,"" Dwayne McDonald, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner, said.
Van Rootselaar was known to police, and ""we've begun the process of reaching out to"" the public health care system to ""understand what interactions may have taken place,"" British Columbia Premier David Eby told a news conference outside the Tumbler Ridge town hall late on Wednesday evening.
The suspect previously had a valid gun licence that had since lapsed, McDonald said.
Police said Van Rootselaar had dropped out of Tumbler Ridge Secondary School four years ago.
Around 13:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Tuesday, police received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Officers arrived on the scene within two minutes of the call, heard active gunfire and entered the school, McDonald said.
Within minutes they located the shooter, who was deceased from what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Authorities found two firearms - a long gun and a modified handgun - on the scene. But McDonald said it remains unclear the exact roles the firearms played in the shooting.
Police then began searching for victims throughout the school. Two victims were taken to hospital by air ambulance and remain in hospital.
Tumbler Ridge has about 2,400 residents, and its secondary school has 160 students in Grades 7-12.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the students and teachers ""bore witness to unheard-of cruelty"" during the shooting, noting that some victims remain in hospital ""fighting for their lives"".
Tumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka told reporters late on Wednesday the close-knit community was ""one big family.""
""Lend your ear when someone needs your ear,"" he said, growing emotional at times. ""Lend your shoulder when someone needs your shoulder. Give somebody a hug.""

'One in a billion': Dawson's Creek stars lead tributes to James Van Der Beek,2026-02-12T09:02:30.628Z," Nardine Saad
Reporting from Los Angeles
","Dawson's Creek actors have led tributes to James Van Der Beek, who has died at the age of 48 after having bowel cancer.
In a hand-written statement posted on Instagram, Katie Holmes remembered Van Der Beek and his ""bravery, compassion, selflessness and strength"", as well as the actor's ""appreciation for life"".
Co-star Busy Philipps wrote: ""James Van Der Beek was one in a billion and he will be forever missed and I don't know what else to say. I am just so so sad.""
Other stars who reacted to Van Der Beek's death include Reese Witherspoon, an executive producer on Legally Blonde prequel Elle, in which Van Der Beek will posthumously star, who said she was ""devastated"" by his death.
""What an extraordinary, talented man who also showed great kindness and grace in every action,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""Praying all the angels watch over his family during this difficult time.""
Van Der Beek was diagnosed with cancer in the latter half of 2023 and revealed the news in November 2024.
The star played Dawson Leery in the hit TV show, which ran from 1998 to 2003, as well as starring in other shows and films including Varsity Blues.
In her tribute, Holmes, who played Joey Potter in Dawson's Creek, added: ""I mourn this loss with a heart holding the reality of his absence and deep gratitude for his imprint of it.""
Philipps, who played a university roommate of Joey, portrayed by Holmes, added: ""He was my friend and I loved him and I'm so grateful for our friendship all these years.""
She urged her 2.4 million followers to help his family through an online fundraiser to help with medical bills and other expenses.
The GoFundMe page posted online on Wednesday solicited donations to assist Van Der Beek's widow Kimberley and their six children, whose ages range from four to 15. It had raised $1.2m (£865,000) by Thursday morning.
""I am profoundly heartbroken for his incredible wife Kimberly and their six magical children,"" Philipps said, sharing photos from their time on the teen drama.
Mary-Margaret Humes, who played Van Der Beek's mother on Dawson's Creek, shared an Instagram tribute in honour of her late co-star on Wednesday.
""Rarely am I at a loss for words... today would be the exception. James, my gracious warrior, you fought a hard battle against all odds with such quiet strength and dignity,"" she wrote alongside two photos of them together.
""I will always love and admire you for that. Our last conversations ... merely a few days ago ... are forever sitting softly in my heart for safe keeping. To our extended Dawson's Creek family of friends, please be respectful of our silences at the moment as Beautiful Kimberly and family have asked for peaceful privacy for now.""
Philipps and Van Der Beek reunited on screen in 2012 for an episode of ABC comedy Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, in which Van Der Beek played a fictionalised version of himself.
Actress Krysten Ritter, Van Der Beek's co-star in Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, remembered him as a ""beautiful human inside and out"".
Ritter wrote on Instagram: ""Smart, funny, empathic, kind, talented and just pure magic. I'm so grateful for our friendship and so heartbroken. All my love goes out to his amazing wife Kimberly and their children.""
""Love you so much James and fake James,"" she added.
While Van Der Beek was set to reunite with his Dawson's Creek co-stars - including Oscar nominee Michelle Williams, Holmes and Joshua Jackson last September - the actor could only make a video appearance due to his illness.
Hamilton and In the Heights creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who stepped in for Van Der Beek at the event, paid tribute to the actor on Instagram, writing that his ""whole heart"" was with Van Der Beek's family.
Actor and TV presenter Alfonso Ribeiro shared on Instagram that he got to say goodbye to his ""true friend, brother and life guide"" over the weekend, writing that he will always cherish his role as godfather to Van Der Beek's daughter Gwen and now sees Van Der Beek as his guardian angel.
""I was with him through this horrible journey to beat cancer. His family and friends went on this roller coaster ride. The highs when it looked like he had it beat to the breaking lows of it coming back,"" the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air alum wrote.
Retired wrestler and cheerleader Stacy Keibler shared a photo of herself and Van Der Beek taking in a sunset as the actor was seated in a wheelchair.
She said that she to got to spend Van Der Beek's final days with him.
""When you know time is sacred, you don't waste a single breath. You don't rush. You don't scroll. You don't worry about tomorrow. You sit. You listen. You hold hands. You watch the sky change colors and you let it change you too.
""In these past days, you taught me more about being present than any book ever could. You showed me what it looks like to trust God's plan, even when it breaks your heart. Especially when it breaks your heart,"" she wrote.
Actor Chad Michael Murray, who appeared in Dawson's Creek and One Tree Hill, described Van Der Beek as ""a giant"".
""His words, art and humanity inspired all of us - he inspired us to be better in all ways. God bless you guys,"" he wrote in the comments section of the family's Instagram post announcing his death.
""I'm so grateful for being able to call James a brother. I'll miss him deeply. Rest easy,"" added Kerr Smith, who starred alongside Van Der Beek in Dawson's Creek.
""James represented something to aspire to,"" wrote One Tree Hill actor Austin Nichols, who also appeared in Varsity Blues.
""As a friend, husband and father, I know he was even more powerful and inspiring. You will be missed,"" Nichols said.
Commenting on the family's Instagram announcement, Buffy the Vampire Slayer star Sarah Michelle Gellar wrote that she is ""so sad for your beautiful family"".
""While James legacy will always live on, this is a huge loss to not just your family but the world,"" the actress wrote.
Actress Jennifer Garner described Van Der Beek's death as a ""heartbreaking loss"" and sent love to his widow and children as they ""navigate this tender time"".

Party balloon or cartel drones? Closure of El Paso airspace causes 'chaos',2026-02-12T04:26:41.768Z," Olivia Ireland
Brandon DrenonandBernd Debusmann
Reporting from the White House
","The sudden and unexpected closure of the airspace over El Paso, Texas, appears to have stemmed from the US federal government conducting drone-related tests.
The 10-day closure, which ultimately ended hours after it was announced late Tuesday, caused a mass panic in the US-Mexico border city, with the mayor telling the BBC that the chaos ""was completely unnecessary"".
The US Department of Defense said the airspace issue was due to the military disabling drones being used by Mexican cartels.
But CBS News, the BBC's news partner, said the closure followed a test earlier this week, where an energy laser was used to shoot down what appeared to be a foreign drone, but was actually a party balloon.
""Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace. The Department of War took action to disable the drones,"" a Trump administration official said after the area reopened Wednesday morning.
Citing multiple sources close to the matter, CBS reported the Pentagon had planned to test new military technology - reportedly a high-energy laser - to practice taking down drones near a military base next to the El Paso airport.
Meetings to discuss the technology's safety were scheduled with the FAA, but the defence department wanted to test it sooner, prompting the FAA - which regulates airspace safety - to halt flights, according to CBS.
Hours after the announced airspace closure, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posted on X that the FAA had worked with the Pentagon to ""address a cartel drone incursion"" and the ""restrictions have been lifted"".
The BBC has not independently confirmed the reported dispute between the military and the FAA. The Pentagon declined to comment when contacted by the BBC, and a Trump administration official told the BBC that it is ""in lockstep to safeguard America's national security and southern border against all foreign intrusions"".
The Associated Press, New York Times and other US media on Wednesday published similar reports.
CBS reported that cartels have been using drones on the border lately but it was unclear whether the military had downed any yet using the technology that was being tested.
El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson told the BBC that the city was not notified in advance about the 10-day closure, and that it spark fears from residents of a potential military conflict brewing.
""We haven't had flight restrictions like this since 9/11,"" he said, referring to the terror attacks on 11 September 2001, which shut down airspace across the entire US, and led to the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.
""And keep in mind, in 9/11, we were only shut down at the airport for two days.""
Renard added that it is still unclear to residents and city leaders why the airspace was closed, and that they have received no explanation from the FAA.
""What they were doing caused complete chaos,"" he said, adding: ""People were confused. They didn't know what to do.""
In an earlier news conference, the mayor said that medical evacuation flights were diverted because of the closure. Another flight that was carrying surgical equipment ""did not show up here in El Paso"".
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters on Wednesday that her government had ""no information indicating drone activity at the border"".
""If the FAA or any US government agency has relevant information, they can ask directly the Government of Mexico,"" she said.
Long-term airspace closures are rare. Since 2018, the FAA has cut airspace closures from an average of more than four hours per launch to just more than two hours, according to its web site.
The restriction covered a 10-mile radius around El Paso, including parts of southern New Mexico, west of the town San Teresa.
After the initial closure, El Paso International Airport said in a statement it was told ""on short notice"" to halt all flights and contacted the FAA for more information.
City Council member Chris Canales, who represents an area on the southwestern side of El Paso, told the BBC, ""The notice was published without any advance notice to local governments or to local air traffic controllers.""
The cancellations were so abrupt that people reported being told by airlines that their flights were still scheduled, even after the FAA's announcement.
""Just called (United Airlines) about my flight this morning and they said it's still scheduled to leave???"" one woman commented on Instagram early Wednesday.
Some on social media speculated about broader conspiracy theories and wondered if the US was on the brink of war.
""It is significant that the US shut down a major airport,"" Mick Mulroy, a former US Marine, CIA paramilitary officer and deputy assistant secretary of defense told the BBC.
""If the purpose was for counter drone activity related to cartel drones, it makes sense as the primary means to do so is through electronic warfare (EW),"" he added. ""EW poses a real risk to civilian aviation. Therefore it was prudent to do so.""
Mulroy said the alleged cartel drones were most likely being used for surveillance and ""not anything offensive"".
Mexico's Ciudad Juarez is just south and west of El Paso, and US Army base Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range lie to the north.
Fort Bliss is a military post focused on training and White Sands Missile Range is the country's largest overland testing range for missiles, rockets and advanced weapons.
In Mexico's interior, cartels have used drones to drop explosives on rivals or security forces, and one cartel, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has a specialised drone unit.
But along the border, drones are used primarily to help cartels gather intelligence and mostly for human smuggling operations.
""They monitor the position of Border Patrol agents and relay that to migrants to direct them across the border,"" said Parker Asmann, an expert in Mexican cartels at the Washington-based think tank Insight Crime. ""It's about gathering intelligence, surveillance and doing reconnaissance.""
In the El Paso area, which Asmann called a ""hub"" for human trafficking, drones are a ""newer"" technology performing work that would have previously been done mostly by ""spotters"" in the hills.
Drone activity in the area, however, is extremely regular, and it remains unclear why the reported incursion on Wednesday prompted a sudden and large-scale airspace closure.
Mayor Renard said its common for unauthorised drones to fly in the area.
""I don't think this is the first time a drone has entered the airspace. And I don't think it's going to be the last time,"" he said.
""You cannot shut down a major city in the United States for 10 days. That is completely unacceptable.
""For a couple of hours, if they were doing a test, we can completely understand that. But you can't come in and say, 'oh by the way we're gonna be shut down for that many days',"" he continued.
""A drone does not rise to the level of 9/11.""

US House votes to overturn Trump's tariffs on Canada,2026-02-12T01:42:28.923Z," Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu
Washington
","The US House of Representatives has voted to rescind US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods.
In a 219 to 211 vote, six Republican lawmakers joined Democrats to back a resolution that seeks to end the tariffs Trump imposed on Canada last year.
The vote is largely symbolic as it will still need to be approved by the US Senate and then approved by Trump, who is very unlikely to sign it into law.
Since his re-election, Donald Trump has imposed a series of tariffs on Canada, recently threatening a 100% import tax in response to Canada's proposed trade deal with China.
As the vote was taking place on the House floor, Trump posted on Truth Social: ""Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time.""
""TARIFFS have given us Economic and National Security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege,"" he added.
The vote came after US House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally in Congress, unsuccessfully tried to block discussion on the chamber's floor by lawmakers on Trump's tariffs.
With Republicans holding a thin majority in the US House, the six Republican defections along with a near-united front from Democrats was enough to secure the votes.
The measure had been introduced by Democrat Gregory Meeks who said that Trump had ""weaponized tariffs"" against allies and destabilized the global economy.
""Not only have these tariffs done immense harm to our relationship with Canada, pushing them closer to China, they have driven up prices here at home,"" he said before the vote.
Representative Don Bacon from Nebraska was one of the six Republicans who crossed the aisle to join Democrats in approving the measure. Before the vote, he said ""tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying.""
The bill now heads to the US Senate where Republicans also hold the majority. Even if it cleared that hurdle, it is unlikely to be signed into law.
Separately, Trump's tariffs are also facing legal scrutiny as the US Supreme Court is set to rule soon on a case questioning the president's legal authority to impose the levies.
Meeks, the top Democrat on the US House Foreign Affairs committee, said the measure on Canada is the first of several bills he plans to introduce that aim to roll back Trump's signature trade action.
""Our fight doesn't stop here,"" he said in a video posted online before the vote. ""I have resolutions also to end trump's tariffs on Mexico, on Brazil, and on his Liberation Day global tariffs.""

Dawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek dies aged 48,2026-02-11T23:29:51.248Z," Emma SaundersandNardine Saad
Los Angeles
California
","Actor James Van Der Beek, best known for his starring role in US teen drama Dawson's Creek, has died aged 48 after being diagnosed with bowel cancer.
""Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning,"" his family said in a statement posted to his social media accounts. ""He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace.""
The star was diagnosed with the disease in the latter half of 2023 but only revealed the news in November 2024.
The father of six starred in multiple popular shows and films in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including the cult classic Dawson's Creek and Varsity Blues.
In an interview with Business Insider, he revealed he started experiencing changes in his bowel movements, a common symptom of bowel cancer. He stopped drinking coffee to see whether that would help before having a screening test.
That revealed he had stage three of the disease, which meant it had spread to nearby lymph nodes.
Colorectal cancer develops from growths in the colon's inner lining and can spread if not treated, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
More men develop this form of cancer than women. Increased screenings have helped detect it early - lowering the number of people who die from colorectal cancer, the clinic notes.
Van Der Beek said his ""lowest point"" in treatment was feeling like he was losing core parts of his identity.
""All these beautiful things that I love, and I used to define myself as - a father, a provider, a husband - all that got taken away, or at least paused,"" he said. ""I had to sit there and say, 'Well, what am I?' And it was, 'I'm still worthy of love.'""
Following his own diagnosis, Van Der Beek spent time raising awareness about screening.
""I've learned a lot,"" he told Business Insider. ""If I can save anyone from having to go through this, that's magic.""
Van Der Beek was one of the most famous faces on TV in the late 1990s and 2000s, starring as Dawson Leery alongside Katie Holmes in the hit TV show Dawson's Creek, which ran from 1998 to 2003.
He also starred in the 1999 coming-of-age film Varsity Blues.
He also played a fictionalised version of himself in the cult television show Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, and he performed on the 28th US season of Dancing with the Stars.
Van Der Beek continued working through his diagnosis.
Earlier this year, he guest starred in Prime Video college comedy, Overcompensating.
Van Der Beek made a surprise virtual appearance at a Dawson's Creek reunion charity event on 22 September, having been forced to pull out of the live event due to having two stomach viruses.
The reunion saw the likes of Michelle Williams, Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson and Busy Philipps performing a live table reading of the show's pilot episode from 1998, joined by Lin-Manuel Miranda who stood in for Van Der Beek.
The event raised funds for charity F Cancer and was also a tribute to their castmate.
In an interview with ABC News in 2020, Van Der Beek said he was very shy as a child.
""I never wanted to be an actor as a kid. I wanted to be an athlete,"" he said.

Condolences have been pouring in on the comments section of the family's post announcing Van Der Beek's death and across social media.
In a post with photos over the years, Dawson's Creek co-star Busy Philipps mourned the loss of her friend.
""My heart is deeply hurting for all of us today…every person who knew James and loved him, anyone who loved his work or had the pleasure of meeting him, all of his dear friends and community that surrounded him as he battled this illness,"" she wrote on Instagram.
Philipps, who played Audrey Liddell on the series, directed her 2.4m followers to a fundraiser supporting his family to help with expenses, writing that she was ""heartbroken"" for them.

Director and actress Olivia Munn added: ""I'm so sorry. My prayers are with you and your beautiful family"".
Actress Jennifer Garner described Van Der Beek's death as a ""heartbreaking loss"" and sent love to his widow Kimberly and their children as they ""navigate this tender time"".
Model and make-up artist Tess Holiday said she was ""so incredibly sorry for your loss. My prayers are with you and your sweet ones.""
In a joint post with production company Sony Pictures, the official Dawson's Creek accounts on social media posted a photo of the late actor smiling in character as Dawson Leery.
""His iconic portrayal of Dawson Leery helped define a generation of television for fans and continues to resonate with audiences today,"" the caption read. ""Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones.""
SAG-AFTRA, the labour union representing Hollywood actors and performers that Van Der Beek joined in 1994, honoured him for ""bringing sincerity, depth and heart to his performances"".
Actor Hal Ozsan, who described Van Der Beek as a brother, wrote on Instagram that he does not have the words to express the grief he is feeling: ""There will be a James-sized hole in my heart for the rest of my life.""

Casey Wasserman to stay as chair of LA 2028 Olympics after Epstein files fallout,2026-02-11T21:02:35.129Z," Nardine Saad
Los Angeles
California
","The chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games will remain in his role after its board reviewed mentions of him in recently released files about Jeffrey Epstein.
Casey Wasserman ""should continue to lead LA28 and deliver a safe and successful Games"", the LA28 executive committee of the board said in a statement.
The talent agent came under fire when the US justice department's files showed he flew on Epstein's private plane in 2003 and exchanged emails with Ghislaine Maxwell. Calls for his resignation ensued, and his agency was dropped by two high-profile clients.
Wasserman has said he regrets his emails with Maxwell and he did not have a relationship with the late sex offender.
""We found Mr Wasserman's relationship with Epstein and Maxwell did not go beyond what has already been publicly documented,"" the committee said in a statement to the BBC.
The BBC has contacted representatives for Wasserman.
The LA28 volunteer board of directors includes many entertainment, political, sports and business figures, such as Dreamworks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
Wasserman has said he ""deeply regrets"" decades-old flirtatious emails with Maxwell, Epstein's accomplice who is currently serving a 20-year prison term for the trafficking of minors for sex.
He also emphasised that he had ""never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein"".
The sports and entertainment executive has not being accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.
The LA28 board said in its statement that it took allegations of misconduct seriously and that Wasserman had fully co-operated with its review by outside counsel.
""Twenty-three years ago, before Mr Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell's deplorable crimes, Mr Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein's plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation,"" the statement said.
""This was his single interaction with Epstein. Shortly after, he traded the publicly-known emails with Maxwell.""
Based on those factors, the statement added, as well as ""the strong leadership"" Wasserman has exhibited over the past decade, the executive committee of the board determined that he should continue to lead LA28.
Singer Chappell Roan announced her split with Wasserman's namesake firm this week, saying that she has a ""duty to protect her team"" and her decision reflected her belief that ""meaningful change in our industry requires accountability"".
Roan made no mention of Epstein, nor the Epstein files, in her statement on Instagram.
Hall of Fame US football striker Abby Wambach likewise announced that she was leaving the agency, writing on Instagram: ""I read Casey Wasserman's correspondences in the Epstein files.
""I know what I know, and I am following my gut and my values. I will not participate in any business arrangement under his leadership.""
Wasserman is also facing calls by artists and staff from inside his agency to step down from or sell the firm, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Monica Rodriguez, who joined some other LA city council members to call for Wasserman's resignation last week, pushed back against the board's Wednesday decision.
Rodriguez, who serves on a committee that oversees the Olympic Games in LA, told the Los Angeles Times that residents ""deserve leadership that understands the gravity of these revelations"".

'It was terrifying': Tumbler Ridge's tight-knit community in shock after shooting,2026-02-11T18:39:23.669Z," Robert GreenallandGabriela Pomeroy
","People in the small Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge have reacted with shock and disbelief after nine people were killed and at least 25 wounded in a shooting at a local secondary school and home.
Members of the remote community, 415 miles (667 km) northeast of the western city of Vancouver, spoke of their fear and uncertainty during the school lockdown, as no-one appeared to be aware of the magnitude of what was unfolding.
They described how close the community of just 2500 people was, and how devastated it would be by what had happened.
""I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,"" town mayor Darryl Krakowka told Canadian broadcaster CBC.
""I don't call them residents. I call them family,"" he added.
Chris Norbury, a town councillor, was as close as anyone in Tumbler Ridge to the shooting. His wife teaches at the secondary school, his daughter attends the nearby elementary school and he works at the visitor centre just a block away.
Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newsday programme, he explained how scared and anxious he felt as he waited for news of his wife.
He first realised something was wrong when his daughter's school called him to say they were in lockdown. He was able to contact his wife, who was also under lockdown, but by the time he found out - from an emergency alert - that there was an active shooter, he was unable to contact her again.
""We just had to speculate and jump into social media to see what was going on - there was a lot of speculation... but being who I am I just wanted to stay calm as best I could and wait for the facts,"" Norbury said.
That proved far from easy, though.
""It was terrifying, it's hard to put into words the dread and the fear that you feel knowing that a loved one is in danger,"" he said.
Meanwhile he was able to see emergency vehicles, including helicopters, coming and going from the school and a nearby medical centre.
That feeling of helplessness and of not knowing what was happening was felt by those within the school too.
One father told the BBC his son was there while the shooting took place.
The child and his friends were busy studying in their classroom when ""all of a sudden they heard gunshots going off"", the father said.
""They were huddled in a corner of the classroom for two to three hours. It felt a lot lot longer.
Some of the students were ""really freaking out and crying"", the father said.
""My son was trying to console them. He tried to stay as calm as he could, but he is pretty shaken up, and he is scared... He didn't know where the gunshots were coming from.""
The boy told his dad it was a terrifying experience, and they didn't know what was going on. Luckily he was unharmed, but he is still waiting to hear information about some of his friends.
""I'm just so thankful that I didn't have to bury my kid,"" the father told the BBC.
Darian Quist, a grade 12 student at the school, was in a classroom with a teacher and about 15 students when the lockdown alarm sounded, though he believes he was in a different part of the school from the shooting. He and his classmates stayed there until the police escorted them out.
""For a while I didn't think anything was going on, but once everything was circulating and we realised something was wrong we got tables and barricaded the doors, and I believe we sat in there for two or two-and-a-half hours,"" he told CBC.
He said everyone was tense and nervous. People sent him ""disturbing"" photos, he said, with ""blood and things like that"".
""I think that's when it all set in,"" he said.
His mother Shelley Quist was working at the local hospital at the time. She said they only found out about the shooter half an hour after the lockdown - though she was on the phone with her son the whole time.
""It's just one of those things when you just think it's never going to happen,"" she said, adding: ""Panic was setting in until I laid eyes on [Darian].""
Norbury said that it wasn't until after 17:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after the lockdown was first announced - that people started to be released from the school and he was able to find out that his wife was safe.
Quist described the departure as ""organised chaos"". ""Professionalism definitely took hold,"" he said.
But even then those involved did not know the full extent of what had happened until the casualty figures were revealed.
""A lot of people are shaken up right now, especially when we were told the true numbers,"" Darian Quist said.
Though the names of the victims have not yet been released, it is clear the whole town has been deeply affected.

Are you in Tumbler Ridge? Share your experiences here
Norbury said he believed he may have known some of the children involved.
""I was a children's librarian for 10 years, and knowing that these children that I likely knew, that I likely read to... these are our friends, our friends' children have been injured, lost their life, and we just have to think how to come together as a community and rely upon each other for support,"" he said.
He added: ""Crime is incredibly low here, we've never had anything like this before. It's an incredible shock that anything like this could happen. We're such a tight-knit community, we're really like a family here.""
Norbury also reflected on the effect the shooting would have on the community in the future.
""How many people will be afraid to go to school? How many will this affect for the rest of their lives? And it absolutely will, that's my fear,"" he said.
""If I could talk to those people, I'd say, don't let this define you. Please get help when you need help. We are strong and we are resilient and we will get through this"".

Police release man detained in connection to Nancy Guthrie disappearance,2026-02-11T18:23:20.576Z," Koh Ewe
","Police have released a man hours after they detained him in connection to the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie, CBS News, the BBC's US partner, has reported.
After taking the man into custody at a traffic stop, police searched his home in Rio Rico, south of Tucson, Arizona, sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News.
After his release, the man, identified only as Carlos, told reporters outside his home that he did not know who Nancy Guthrie was. ""I don't follow the news,"" he said.
Guthrie, 84, was abducted from her home near Tucson more than a week ago, sparking a widespread search and desperate appeals from her family.
""I hope they get the suspect, because I'm not it,"" Carlos said, according to a video posted on X by CBS reporter Andres Gutierrez.
Carlos, reportedly a deliveryman, said he had been driving around and noticed authorities were following him.
He added that the officers did not ask him any questions and made him wait for hours in a car park.
A woman who identified herself as his mother-in-law earlier said that he had nothing to do with the case.
""They're just invading my property,"" she was quoted as saying by CBS.
The Pima County Sherrif's Department had confirmed police were conducting a court-authorised search at a location in Rio Rico, south of Tucson, Arizona.
The news of the detention came hours after the FBI released images and videos of a masked person at Nancy Guthrie's doorstep on the night of her disappearance. Authorities said the individual was armed.
""As of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance,"" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement on X.
He said authorities had been working to recover images from the home surveillance system that ""may have been lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors - including the removal of recording devices"".
The two short videos show the person approach the front door of Nancy Guthrie's home, then check the camera before moving away, picking up some vegetation from the ground and using it to cover the camera lens.
Savannah Guthrie shared the new video on Instagram. ""Someone out there recognises this person,"" she said on Tuesday. ""We believe she is still out there. Bring her home.""
On Wednesday, the FBI said it was conducting an ""extensive search"" in the Catalina Foothills are related to the investigation.
A senior official told CBS that the White House was monitoring the situation in Tucson closely.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that US President Donald Trump had reviewed the surveillance footage.
Trump's initial reaction to the footage was ""pure disgust"", Leavitt said in response to a question at the press briefing.
""The President directed me to please encourage all Americans with any information to call the FBI,"" she added.
US President Donald Trump, who ordered federal authorities to help in the investigation, previously called the case ""very unusual"".
Guthrie was last seen at her home in Catalina Foothills, an affluent neighbourhood roughly 6 miles (10km) north-east of Tucson, on the evening of 31 January, when family members dropped her off after dinner.
Authorities are investigating a series of ransom notes that could have been from her abductors, including one that contained two deadlines: 5 February and 9 February.
Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have released several videos on social media pleading for their mother's release.
The latest video was posted on Monday - the reported ransom deadline. In it, Savannah Guthrie pleads for the public to help locate her missing mother.
""I just want to share a few thoughts as we enter another week of this nightmare,"" she said in a the video posted on Instagram. ""She was taken, and we don't know where. And we need your help.""
The family has warned about their mother's ill health, saying that her health and heart were ""fragile"" and she ""lives in constant pain"".
""She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,"" the news anchor said in a video posted on Instagram.
Officials have also warned that Nancy Guthrie may be in dire health without her medication.
Authorities said on the night of her disappearance, the app on her pacemaker - an implanted cardiac device - disconnected from her phone.
Police also said they found blood on Guthrie's porch and analysis confirmed it was hers.
The FBI is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for information on the case.

Grand jury declines to charge Democrats in 'illegal orders' video,2026-02-11T16:58:15.894Z," Brandon Drenon
","US federal prosecutors have failed to secure an indictment against six members of Congress who published a video last year encouraging US troops to disobey orders they deem illegal.
A grand jury declined to indict the Democratic lawmakers on charges of seditious conspiracy in the case pursued by the office of the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, who was nominated to the position by President Donald Trump.
Trump had branded the video ""seditious"" and a federal probe into the video was launched shortly after.
One lawmaker, Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy captain and astronaut, has sued the government for moving to reduce his retirement rank over the video.
Following news of the failed indictment, Kelly wrote on social media: ""This is an outrageous abuse of power by Donald Trump and his lackies.
""It wasn't enough for Pete Hegseth to censure me and threaten to demote me, now it appears they tried to have me charged with a crime.""
The BBC has reached out to the US Department of Justice for comment.
The justice department had sought to charge the lawmakers, who had all either served in the military or had roles in intelligence, under a criminal statute known as 18 U.S.C. § 2387, which includes treason, sedition and subversive activities, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.
It contains a maximum 10-year prison sentence for those who encourage ""insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty by any member of the military"".
The other five member of the House who participated in the video are Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.
On Tuesday, Slotkin wrote on X: ""Today, it was a grand jury of anonymous American citizens who upheld the rule of law and determined this case should not proceed.
""Hopefully, this ends this politicized investigation for good.""
Critics of the Trump administration had called the government's crackdown on the six lawmakers an attack on free speech and said it was another instance of the president seeking to punish those he perceives as political enemies.
The controversy stems from a 90-second video released last November by the lawmakers, telling US service members that they ""can refuse illegal orders"".
It was released amid rising questions of legality regarding American strikes on alleged narco-trafficking boats off the coast of South America.
Kelly said in the video: ""Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.""
""Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our constitution aren't just coming from abroad but from right here at home.""

What are Canada's gun ownership laws?,2026-02-11T15:39:19.544Z," Jaroslav Lukiv
","A deadly mass shooting at a school in British Columbia is likely to increase scrutiny of whether Canada's gun laws should be toughened to prevent further attacks.
Nine people were killed and another 25 injured in the attack at Tumbler Ridge on Tuesday, in a remote part of the country that's about 415 miles (667km) north of Vancouver. The suspect was also found dead with a self-inflicted injury, authorities said.
Currently, gun ownership in the Canadian provinces is largely federally regulated by the government in Ottawa, and there are stricter laws in place than in most US states.
Mass shootings in Canada are rare, especially if compared with its southern neighbour.
Still, gun-related killings as a percentage of all homicides are significantly higher in Canada than in England and Wales, or Australia.
Tumbler Ridge mass shooting live updates
Under Canada's Firearms Act, guns must be kept locked and unloaded.
Anyone wishing to buy a firearm is also subject to extensive background checks and needs to have a licence.
Across the country, more than 2.2 million people - or 7.7% of Canada's adult population - had firearm licences, according to government statistics from 2021.
An estimated 10 million firearms were in circulation in the country that year.
According to a Canadian website on gun ownership, which obtained statistics from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or RCMP, there were 355,678 gun licences in British Columbia as of 2023, or about 6,240 gun licenses per 100,000 people. But the website cautioned that many people own guns without a licence, which is illegal.
A national freeze on the sale and transfer of handguns has also been in place since 2022. In January, the government began a national gun buy-back programme. A federal pilot programme in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, which aimed to collect 200 firearms, had only collected 26.
The latest mass shooting follows a string of others over the past decade.
In 2020, a gunman posing as a police officer killed 22 people in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia province over a two-day period - in what is Canada's deadliest mass shooting.
In the wake of the attacks, most military-grade assault-style weapons were banned in the country.
In 2017, a gunmen killed worshippers in a Quebec City mosque in Canada's province of Quebec. The attacker got a life sentence.
A year earlier, four people - including two at a school - were killed in La Loche, western Saskatchewan province. A 17-year-old attacker was later sentenced to life in prison.
In 2014, a gunman shot dead eight people, including two children, in Edmonton, Alberta, in western Canada.
One of the deadliest shootings in the country took place decades earlier - in 1989. Fourteen women were killed by a gunman in an anti-feminist attack at l'École Polytechnique university in Montreal.

Michael B Jordan says Fourth Wing TV show won't be 'cheesy',2026-02-11T11:56:59.498Z," Christal Hayes
Los Angeles
California
","Best-selling fantasy book Fourth Wing is coming to life in a TV adaptation - but Michael B Jordan, whose company is developing the show, says the casting of its beloved characters is still very much in the works and there won't be any ""obvious choices"".
The actor told the BBC he hopes to cast a mixture of new faces along with some well-known names.
""When it's done the right way, I think you can have a nice balance where casting won't be distracting,"" he told the BBC.
The star, who is nominated for an Academy Award for the hit film Sinners, promised that the show - about dragons, magic, warfare and steamy romance - won't be ""cheesy"".
Jordan's production company Outlier Society snapped up the rights with Amazon to author Rebecca Yarros' fantasy novels, which have sold millions of copies globally in 40 languages.
He acknowledged that casting would be crucial for adapting the Empyrean series, starting with Fourth Wing. The book franchise now spans three books, with two more expected.
""It allows people to, like, fall in love with the characters that they have imagined in their head without any baggage, with projecting their own feelings on certain casts,"" he explained.
Jordan noted that the number of roles in the series would allow a deep cast of characters.
""So just know, it's nothing cheesy coming out. It ain't no obvious choices. I think it's going to be something that feels honest,"" he added.
Jordan will be an executive producer on the Fourth Wing TV series. Asked whether he might play a role himself, he looked around before repeatedly replying: ""I don't know.""
Jordan was speaking on Tuesday at the annual Academy Awards luncheon in Los Angeles, where his Vampire horror film Sinners was widely celebrated after becoming the most nominated film in Oscars history.
Jordan's nomination for best actor is among 16 nods the film nabbed for Hollywood's most coveted honours, which are set to take place next month in Los Angeles.
Now, the Black Panther and Creed star is moving into doing more producing and directing, including with the forthcoming heist remake The Thomas Crown Affair. It follows his 2023 directorial debut with Creed III.
""As I've grown, my career has grown, and the want to explore other parts of the industry and other parts of our business and other parts of storytelling has always kind of been there,"" he explained to the BBC.
""It's been something I've been wanting to do for a long time,"" he said, noting his work is sometimes the ""hunter, gatherer of IP (intellectual property)"" to develop.

"Brad Pitt blockbuster F1 sequel in the works, producer confirms",2026-02-11T07:23:20.605Z," Christal Hayes
Los Angeles
California
","Lights out and away we go - again!
A sequel to the Brad Pitt blockbuster F1 is officially in the works, the film's producer Jerry Bruckheimer has told the BBC.
The film, co-produced by seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, is nominated for four Oscars this year – including best picture. Pitt, 62, stars as veteran driver, Sonny Hayes, who returns to the Formula 1 grid with the fictional team APXGP after a long absence.
Speculation about a possible sequel has been circulating for months but had not previously been confirmed, including during Apple TV's press day last week, where the film is streaming.
Speaking to the BBC at the annual Academy Awards luncheon in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Bruckheimer said: ""We're working on a sequel.""
The producer declined to give a timeline for the project or confirm casting details, including whether Pitt would reprise his role. But Bruckheimer added that he would ""of course"" be involved in casting decisions.
Released last summer, F1 grossed $630m (£467m) worldwide, making it Apple Original Films' most successful theatrical release to date. The production featured extensive filming during the 2023 and 2024 Formula 1 seasons, with scenes shot at multiple race weekends, including the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.
Bruckheimer said he was ""surprised"" and delighted by the film's awards recognition, including its best picture nomination.
""It was a long journey to get the movie made because we had to endure a couple of strikes – but in the end, the movie entertained audiences around the world,"" he said of F1. ""I never worked with Brad Pitt before and it's really a thrill to work with Brad.""
He said the annual luncheon was a great chance to ""reminisce"" with others he's worked with over the years.
Bruckheimer, who was last nominated at the Academy Awards for Top Gun: Maverick, also discussed his stacked calendar of projects.
He disclosed that plans were underway for Heat 2, along with another Days of Thunder film - the 1990s NASCAR film starring Tom Cruise.
He is also working on another Top Gun movie and another film in the Pirates of Caribbean franchise. Bruckheimer also touted a ""very interesting"" UFO project.
""We've got a lot of things in the hopper,"" he said. ""We're just waiting for one of them to get a great script and get it made.""
Last week, Apple TV held a press day to discuss upcoming projects.
Apple senior executive Eddie Cue read out an audience question about a possible F1 sequel, and Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali responded by telling fans to ""stay tuned"", adding that there would be more to say ""in the future"", according to media reports from the event.
Bruckheimer also spoke about the transitions happening in Hollywood – from massive studio mergers and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to politics and production cuts.
He spoke of feeling ""optimistic"" – noting that people would continue to need and want live entertainment.
""When they say the theatres are dying, it's because of us,"" he said. ""Because we haven't given things that people want to see.""

Who is in the Epstein files?,2026-02-11T03:58:27.241Z," Brandon Drenon
","The list of some of the world's most rich and powerful people with ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has lengthened, after the US government released millions of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier.
There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing. Many people who have featured in previous releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.
Here is a list of some of the people mentioned in the latest release.
The documents include email correspondence between Epstein and tech billionaire Elon Musk over travel plans Epstein appeared to be arranging, although Musk has said he has never visited Epstein's private island.
In November 2012, Musk wrote in one email: ""What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?""
In another, from December the same year, he wrote: ""I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose"", adding that a ""peaceful island experience"" is the opposite of what he's wanting.
Response: Musk responded in an X post in January, acknowledging that the emails might be used to ""smear my name"", but said he was more concerned about the prosecution of ""those who committed serious crimes with Epstein"".
Two emails from 18 July 2013 are written as though drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they are genuine or were ever sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.
One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates ""to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls"".
In an interview with NPR, his ex-wife Melinda said the release of the documents brought up memories of their marital struggles.
""I'm able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, my God, how did that happen to those girls?"" she said.
""At least for me, I've been able to move on in life, and I hope there's some justice for those now-women.""
Response: A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: ""These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.""

The US president is mentioned many times in the newly released files, which includes a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line.
Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence.
The list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures.
Response: Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.
Photographs appearing to show Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground have also been included in the latest Epstein files release.
In two of the images, the former prince is seen touching the person, who is unidentified and fully clothed, on her stomach. Another image shows him staring directly at the camera.
No context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken.
Response: BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Richard Branson's name appears many times in the files.
In one 2013 exchange, Epstein thanks Branson for his recent hospitality and public relations advice, to which Branson replies that it was ""really nice"" seeing him, adding: ""Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!""
Virgin Group has clarified that ""harem"" referred to three adult members of Epstein's team.
Response: In a statement to the BBC, Virgin Group said Branson's contact with Epstein was ""only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event"".
The statement added: ""When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations.
""As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again. Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever – Richard believes that Epstein's actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims.""
Sarah Ferguson, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife, who is invariably known as Fergie, appears to also be mentioned in multiple emails, including when Epstein was still under house arrest.
An email from an account believed to belong to Epstein says: ""I think Fergie can now say, I am not a pedo.""
In another email exchange from April 2009 there is a request to meet Epstein for a ""quick cup of tea"", that includes the lines: ""My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you.""
Response: The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response.
Epstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released in the files suggest, including to his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva.
The Metropolitan Police has launched a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.
In 2009, one year after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor, da Silva sent an email requesting ""anything you can help me with"".
Epstein replied: ""I will wire your loan amount immediately"".
A separate email exchange appears to show Epstein arranging a place for Mandelson to stay at one of his New York apartments, with Epstein writing, ""thrilled to host and sad I'm not there"".
Response: Lord Mandelson has said he will step down from the House of Lords. On Sunday, Mandelson reiterated his regret for ""ever having known Epstein"" and for continuing his association following Epstein's conviction. He has told the BBC he ""was never culpable or complicit in (Epstein's) crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death"". He has not responded to the allegations of leaking documents, but BBC understands that he maintains he did not act criminally and did not act for personal gain. He argues that he sought Epstein's expertise in the national interest during the 2008 global financial crisis.
The files also contain many messages that appear to be sent between the late convicted sex offender and one of Trump's former top advisers, Steve Bannon.
Most messages were sent in 2018 and 2019 after Bannon left his role in the first Trump White House, as he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death.
One text exchange shows Bannon apparently strategising with Epstein on how to change the narrative around his past crimes, suggesting ""first we need to push back on the lies"" and ""rebuild your image as philanthropist"".
Response: Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.
An October 2018 text exchange between Miroslav Lajčák - who was serving as Slovakia's foreign minister at the time - and Epstein appeared to show the two messaging about girls and diplomacy.
After Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: ""Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl.""
""Who wouldn't,"" Epstein texts back. ""You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters.""
Response: Following the latest release of Epstein-related documents, Lajčák resigned from his current post as Slovakia's national security advisor. He is not accused of any wrongdoing.
US Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick brought his family to visit Jeffrey Epstein's private island in 2012, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files' release, contradicting previous claims that he had cut ties with him years earlier.
In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant on what appeared to be the eve of the visit: ""We are looking forward to visiting you"", and, ""We would love to join you for lunch"".
During congressional testimony in February 2026, Lutnick confirmed the visit publicly for the first time, saying he spent about an hour on the island, along with his wife, four children, and their nannies. He previously said he cut off contact with Epstein in 2005.
Response: Lutnick told lawmakers that he was in the region for a vacation, and that in the years since the visit, ""I barely had anything to do with"" Epstein. He also acknowledged another one-hour meeting with Epstein, which took place a year and a half after the island visit.
The commerce department said in a statement to the BBC that ""Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing"".
Larry Summers, US President Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary and former Harvard University president, is also in the new documents, including references to meetings and dinners between Summers and Epstein.
In emails from 2017, Summers and Epstein joked about Trump and criticised him during his first term.
""Your world does not understand how dumb he really is,"" Epstein said of Trump in one email to Summers.
Response: After Summers was mentioned amid a batch of Epstein files released in November, he said he took ""full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein"" and resigned from multiple posts, including his role on the advisory board of OpenAI.
Steve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, is shown in the release of Epstein-related documents inquiring about a woman he met at Epstein's house.
In one email exchange, Tisch asked whether the woman was a professional or a ""civilian"".
In other exchanges, Epstein tells Tisch he had a ""present"" for him and described a woman he would introduce Tisch to as ""tahitian speaks mostly french, exotic"".
Response: In a statement to CNN, Tisch said he and Epstein ""had a brief association"", adding that he ""did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island"".
The director of a new documentary on First Lady Melania Trump, which they produced together, appeared in the newly released files in a photo embracing a young woman.
Brett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured.
Response: There is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner's representative for comment. He told Fox News he never had a personal relationship with Epstein, whom he says he met once. He said the woman he was pictured embracing was his fiancée at the time.
The anti-aging influencer and CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, exchanged a number of emails with Epstein, including crass comments, the latest documents release shows.
In the emails, he wrote that his friendship with Epstein was something he could share publicly and included a discussion of the 2018 Miami Herald story that identified some of Epstein's victims.
He also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex, emails show.
Response: On 2 February, Attia made a statement on X rejecting that he was ""involved in any criminal activity"", adding that "" I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties"".
The chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games sent flirty emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of Epstein.
Casey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, show him saying: ""I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?""
Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein.
Response: Wasserman said in a statement: ""I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light.""
Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google and one of the world's richest men, visited Epstein's private island and made plans to dine at Epstein's home in New York City, according to the documents released on Friday.
He also corresponded with Ghislaine Maxwell, who wrote to Brin in April 2003: ""Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed"", and, ""Look forward to seeing you"".
Response: The BBC has reached out to Google for comment. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing in the emails.
Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is mentioned in the newly released Epstein-related documents, showing they corresponded on multiple occasions after Epstein was convicted for sex crimes in Florida in 2008.
One exchange shows plans for Barak to stay at Epstein's New York City residence in 2017.
Response: Barak has acknowledged his regular interactions with Epstein but said he never observed or participated in any inappropriate behaviour or parties.
Noam Chomsky, the famed linguist, appeared in both releases of the Epstein files, and the latest tranche of documents suggests Chomsky advised Epstein on media coverage of sex trafficking allegations against him.
In emails from February 2019, the disgraced financier asked Chomsky if he should ""defend myself"" or ""try to ignore"".
A response that appears to be from Chomsky laments ""the horrible way"" Epstein was treated and the ""hysteria that has developed about abuse of women"".
""It's painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,"" the email said.
Response: In a statement, Chomsky's wife and spokesperson, Valéria Chomsky, said that ""Epstein created a manipulative narrative about his case, which Noam, in good faith, believed in.""
""It is now clear that it was all orchestrated, having as, at least, one of Epstein's intentions to try to have someone like Noam repairing Epstein's reputation by association,"" she said.
""Noam's criticism was never directed at the women's movement; on the contrary, he has always supported gender equity and women's rights.""
Brad Karp, the chairman of prestigious law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down from his role after the latest files showed dozens of apparent email exchanges between him and Epstein. One correspondence reportedly is said to show Karp discussing Epstein's pre-existing plea deal on sex trafficking charges.
In an email sent in March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, a sender named Brad Karp said: ""The draft motion is in great shape.""
Bloomberg reported that this discussion related to Epstein's efforts to protect the 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors, in which he avoided federal charges, which could have seen him face life in prison. There is nothing in the emails to prove that they were in fact linked to the plea deal.
Response: Announcing his resignation in a company statement on Wednesday, Karp said: ""Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm."" The statement did not mention the Epstein files, and Karp has not commented since. The BBC has contacted Paul Weiss for further comment.
In the justice department's first release of Epstein documents in December, several images showed former US President Bill Clinton, including a picture of him swimming in a pool, and another with him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.
Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was first arrested.
Response: A spokesman for Clinton, Angel Ureña, said on social media in December that photos released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) were decades old. ""They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be,"" he said.
""There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first,"" he said.
In a post on social media, Clinton said that he had told Congress everything he knows.
""I have called for the full release of the Epstein files. I have provided a sworn statement of what I know,"" he said. ""And just this week, I've agreed to appear in person before the committee.""
Clinton will testify before the House Oversight Committee later this month, and has called for the hearing to be public.
The files appear to reveal communication between Epstein and the self-help author Deepak Chopra years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from minors.
In a February 2017 email, Chopra seemingly asks Epstein to come to Israel with him and an unnamed group.
""Come to Israel with us,"" Chopra says. ""Relax and have fun with interesting people. [if] you want use a fake name . Bring your girls. It will be fun to have you . Love""
In another apparent exchange a month later, the pair talk about God and cells of the human body before Chopra says: ""Cells are human constructs. No such thing ! Universe is human construct No such thing. Cute girls are aware when they make noise.""
Later in the discussion, Chopra adds: ""God is a construct. Cute girls are real.""
Epstein also asks the alternative medicine advocate: ""Did you find me a cute Israeli?""
Response: Since these emails emerged, Chopra has posted a statement online saying he was ""deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims in this case"" and denied his involvement in ""any criminal or exploitative conduct.""
""Any contact I had was limited and unrelated to abusive activity. Some past email exchanges have surfaced that reflect poor judgment in tone. I regret that and understand how they read today, given what was publicly known at the time. My focus remains on supporting accountability, prevention, and efforts that protect and support survivors.""
The BBC has asked Chopra if in his dealings with Epstein, he was aware of any wrongdoing.
The 88-year-old retail billionaire, who shared a long friendship with Epstein, is named in a number of files.
The former CEO of Victoria's Secret is identified in one FBI document as a potential ""co-conspirator"", though appearing in the documents does not necessarily imply any wrongdoing.
Wexner has previously alleged that Epstein stole millions of dollars from him while working as his financial adviser.
Response: Wexner's lawyers told the BBC, ""The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.
""Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.""

Under-fire Trump commerce secretary confirms he visited Epstein's island,2026-02-11T03:51:40.735Z," Ana Faguy and Brandon Drenon
on Capitol Hill
","US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed he visited Jeffrey Epstein's island in 2012, contradicting previous claims that he had cut ties with the sex offender years earlier, before he was convicted.
""I did have lunch with him as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation,"" Lutnick testified on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. ""My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies … We had lunch on the island. That is true. For an hour.""
Correspondence about the visit was included in Epstein documents released by the US Department of Justice.
Some lawmakers have called on Lutnick to resign, but on Tuesday the White House said he had the full support of US President Donald Trump.
Lutnick's visit to the island was revealed in emails released by the justice department.
In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant on what appeared to be the eve of the visit: ""We are looking forward to visiting you"", and, ""We would love to join you for lunch"".
The commerce secretary previously told Congress he cut ties with Epstein in 2005 after the late financier - a neighbour of Lutnick in New York - used sexual innuendo to explain why he owned a massage table in a room of his home.
In Tuesday's testimony, he said: ""Over the next 14 years, I met him two other times that I can recall.""
The justice department files show Lutnick visited Epstein's Caribbean island on 23 December, 2012. That came four years after Epstein was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a child.
Lutnick's testimony on Capitol Hill marked the first time he publicly confirmed the visit.
""I don't recall why we did it, but we did it,"" he said Tuesday, referring to the lunch.
Lutnick, who is considered the architect of Trump's global tariffs policy, has not been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.
The other time, outside of meeting Epstein on his island, was a year and a half after that when Lutnick said he had an hour-long meeting with Epstein.
Lutnick noted that within the millions of pages of Epstein documents released by the justice department, roughly 10 emails connect him with Epstein.
""Over a 14-year period, I did not have any relationship with him, I barely had anything to do with that person,"" he said.
Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, grilled Lutnick about the conflicting accounts.
""The issue is not that you engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with Jeffrey Epstein, but that you totally misrepresented the extent of your relationship with him, to the Congress, to the American people and to the survivors of his despicable criminal and predatory acts,"" he said.
Lutnick is among a series of high-profile people named in the more than 3.5 million documents that have been released by the justice department, as mandated by law.
The revelation that Lutnick visited Epstein's island long after he asserted that he had cut off contact has led to bipartisan calls for the commerce secretary to resign from the Trump administration.
Democratic congressman Ro Khanna of California and Republican congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who co-sponsored the law that compelled the justice department to release the Epstein files last year, both urged Lutnick to step down.
After viewing unredacted copies of the files, Khanna revealed the names of six other people on Tuesday that he says were improperly blacked out.
Among them was retail billionaire Les Wexner. Hours after Massie identified him on Monday, the justice department partially unredacted the file.
Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche said the redaction was removed because Wexner's name ""already appears in the files thousands of times. DoJ is hiding nothing.""
The BBC has contacted the justice department for comment.
Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret, is identified in a 2019 FBI document as a potential ""co-conspirator"".
Appearing in the documents does not necessarily imply any wrongdoing.
Wexner has previously alleged that Epstein stole millions of dollars from him while working as his financial adviser.
A legal representative for Wexner told the BBC: ""The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.
""Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.""
Another name revealed by Khanna is Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, CEO of Dubai Ports World. The BBC has contacted him for comment.
The BBC is trying to confirm the identities of the other four people whose names have been unredacted.
While Lutnick was testifying on one side of Capitol Hill, survivors of Epstein abuse gathered on the other to announce Virginia's Law, legislation that aims to remove the time limit for survivors of sexual abuse to file civil claims.
The legislation is named for Virginia Giuffre, who was one of the most well-known survivors of Epstein's sexual abuse. She died by suicide in 2025.
Giuffre's sister-in-law Amanda Roberts said her wish was to eliminate the statute of limitations.
""No more laws that treat survivors as though time can erase harm,"" Roberts said, before adding: ""Pass Virginia's Law.""

Britney Spears sells rights to entire music catalogue,2026-02-11T03:26:37.432Z," Nardine Saad
Los AngelesandClaire Keenan
","Pop superstar Britney Spears has sold the rights to her entire music catalogue, the BBC has learned.
Spears, 44, is said to have sold to independent music publisher Primary Wave on 30 December for around $200m (£146m).
The singer - whose protracted conservatorship long dictated her personal and professional life - is known for the hits ...Baby One More Time, Oops!... I Did It Again, Toxic and Gimme More.
Primary Wave did not immediately respond to the BBC's requests for comment. Representatives for Spears declined to comment.
In January 2024, the singer said she would ""never return to the music industry"". Her last song was a duet released with Elton John in 2022.
Primary Wave has also acquired rights to the estates of Notorious BIG, Prince and Whitney Houston.
Details of the sale and the exact price of Spears' catalogue have not been made public.
High-profile artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, and Shakira recently sold their catalogues too.
Springsteen sold his back catalogue to Sony in 2021 for $500m, and Bieber reportedly signed a $200m deal with Hipgnosis Songs Capital in 2023.
The publisher was founded 20 years ago by music executive Lawrence Mestel after purchasing 50% of Kurt Cobain's portion of the Nirvana catalogue.
Spears is one of the best-selling female artists, with more than 150 million records sold worldwide. Her catalogue includes nine studio albums since her debut in 1999.
The sale comes after a tumultuous few years for the singer, who in 2021 ended a 13-year-long conservatorship – a legal guardianship that saw her finances and personal life controlled by her father.
The singer published her memoir in 2023 titled The Woman in Me, which detailed her struggles living under the conservatorship.
Her ex-husband Kevin Federline released his own memoir, You Thought You Knew, at the end of 2025.

US lawmakers tell BBC Andrew should testify over Epstein files,2026-02-11T02:41:38.282Z," Imogen James
","Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is facing growing pressure from US officials and the family of his prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre to testify in the US about his links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Speaking to the BBC, Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna said the Royal Family had ""not been transparent"", while Democratic Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fernandez said King Charles III ""should direct his brother"" to go to the US to answer questions.
On Monday, the King said the Royal Family were ""ready to support"" police in their inquiries.
Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 containing no admission of liability.
In the King's first intervention in the latest round of revelations in the Epstein scandal, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said if they were approached by the police, they stood ""ready to support them"" in their investigation.
It added the King had ""made clear...his profound concern"" over allegations against his brother, and the King and Queen's ""thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse"".
Thames Valley Police announced on Monday it was assessing a complaint by anti-monarchy group Republic over the alleged sharing of confidential material by Andrew with Epstein.
The former prince appears to have knowingly shared confidential information with Epstein from his official work as trade envoy in 2010 and 2011, according to material in the latest release of files seen by the BBC.
Andrew has been contacted for comment but is yet to respond.
Police assessing claims about Andrew sharing confidential trade details
Epstein emails: So-called 'shady financier' was Andrew's 'trusted money man'
When asked by the BBC if the former prince should go to the US, Khanna said that would be ""appropriate"".
The Congressman, who co-sponsored the law that compelled the justice department to release the Epstein files last year, also said the Royal Family should ""come clean"" and lay out what they knew and what ""action they're going to take"".
""They have a large wealth, they should probably be compensating these survivors for the horrors that have taken place,"" he added.
Khanna said the Royal Family were ""finally"" asking for an investigation, and that ""these women have been denied justice"".
It comes a day after Khanna told journalists this was the ""most vulnerable"" the British monarchy had been, and said stripping Andrew of a title was not enough.
""The King has to answer what he knew,"" he said.
The former prince has also moved out of his Windsor home and is currently living at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk while his new permanent home undergoes renovations.
Congresswoman Teresa Leger Fernandez, who is chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, called for more transparency from Andrew.
Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, she urged the King to tell his brother to ""answer questions here at the Oversight Committee"".
""You cannot say 'I am protected because I'm no longer in the jurisdiction of the United States, so I cannot be held liable',"" Fernandez argued.
She also called for an inquiry in England. She said Andrew ""was there, he knows who else was in the room with him. Who else was at those locations where these attacks took place?""
Sky Roberts, the brother of Virginia Giuffre, piled on the pressure earlier on Tuesday, telling journalists: ""I think he [Andrew] should show up in front of our Congress and answer questions.""
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer agreed.
The latest emails released by the US Department of Justice reveal there have been multiple unsuccessful approaches from US authorities for Andrew to help with Epstein inquiries.
The former prince cannot be forced by a subpoena to go to the US, which has caused a lot of frustration.
Last autumn, Democrats in Congress set a November deadline for the former prince to testify about what he knew about Epstein, but he gave no response.
Since the release of three million more documents related to Epstein, there has been growing pressure on Andrew, with claims a second woman was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with him.
Photographs appearing to show him kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground, both fully dressed, were also included in the latest batch of files.
Andrew has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct.
Correction 11 February 2026: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Teresa Leger Fernandez as a member of the House Oversight Committee. This has been amended.

Epstein files could be just tip of the iceberg for Andrew investigation,2026-02-19T20:17:08.971Z," Daniel Sandford
UK correspondent
","When Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at about 08:00 on Thursday, it had nothing to do with Virginia Giuffre, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse.
What led to him being arrested started with information that came out in the massive Epstein file release in January, around activities while he was a trade envoy for the British government. But it will not have stopped there.
It was emails in those files that seem to be between Andrew and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that led to Thames Valley Police getting involved.
One email in particular stood out. In November 2010, after Andrew had returned from a UK government-funded trip to Asia, he was sent a series of country reports relating to his trip.
Within five minutes of receiving them he seems to have forwarded them to Epstein, who had by this point already been convicted and spent time in prison for sex offences.
There were further email revelations from the files.
A month later, on Christmas Eve, Andrew appeared to email Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money.
In a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew seems to suggest Epstein invest in a private equity firm he had visited a week before.
These will have formed the beginning of what today turned into a full investigation by Thames Valley Police. But detectives will have not relied only on the emails that we have seen.
In order to build a case they will have gone to the government and to the palace asking for emails that might explain what was going on. The palace said last Monday that it would ""support"" Thames Valley Police.
Detectives will also have done their own trawl of the three million documents in the Epstein files, and they will have asked for unredacted copies from the FBI or the US Department of Justice. The National Crime Agency is helping UK police forces with those requests.
So far we have seen only the tip of the iceberg, but detectives may have seen more of what lies under the surface
It is highly unlikely that the police arrested Andrew on Thursday on the basis of just a couple of emails people have seen within the Epstein files.
At this stage, Andrew has only been arrested. He has not been charged. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising from his relationship with Epstein and has not responded to specific BBC questions about the files released in January.
And a reminder, this arrest has nothing to do with allegations Andrew has previously faced from Giuffre, who said she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions in the early 2000s. An out-of-court financial settlement was reached between Andrew and Giuffre in 2022, which made no admission of wrongdoing on Andrew's part.
The police released Andrew under investigation on Thursday evening. Typically with arrests relating to white collar crime, people are held for a few hours to allow for searches and initial questioning. Being released under investigation does not rule out further questioning at a later date.
Now detectives will have a big decision to make. This could take weeks.
Police officers with a crown on their cap badges will sit down with lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service and decide if there is sufficient evidence to charge the King's brother.
If they decide to take the case to court, it will be called R v Mountbatten-Windsor, or in layman's terms, the King against the King's brother.

Man guilty of XL bully offence after fatal attack,2026-02-19T20:26:15.503Z," Shivani Chaudhari
Chelmsford Crown CourtandLewis Adams
","An amateur rapper has been found guilty of owning one of two XL bully dogs that mauled his mother-in-law to death - two days after the breed was banned.
The pet, named Bear, killed Esther Martin, 68, while she was at Ashley Warren's home in Jaywick, Essex, on 3 February 2024.
Warren was filming a music video in London when Martin suffered ""dozens and dozens"" of bite wounds.
The 41-year-old, now of Addlestone in Surrey, will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on 1 April.
The jury spent 14 hours and 28 minutes deliberating before coming to a verdict.
Warren sat in the dock wearing a grey hoodie with his head facing down throughout the hearing.
He had denied being the owner or in charge of two dogs that caused injury resulting in death while dangerously out of control in a private place.
Jurors found him guilty by a majority of 11 to one of being the owner of Bear but cleared him of being in charge of the other dog, Beauty, which also injured Martin, but which, the court heard, belonged to his girlfriend.
He was also found guilty by a majority of 11 to one of possessing a knife at Clacton railway station on 3 February 2024.

Martin, from Woodford Green, east London, was described in court as a ""doting and loving grandmother"".
She was 5ft 3in (1.6m) tall and had restricted movement due to a hip replacement, arthritis and a limp.
Leaving her in charge of the two XL bully dogs, and eight puppies, was a ""tragedy waiting to happen"", prosecutor Christopher Paxton KC said.
She had mobility issues and ""little to no experience"" of being left alone with them for a prolonged period of time, Mr Paxton said.
He told jurors: ""It was, you may think, a tragedy waiting to happen, given the imbalance that arose between 68-year-old Esther, short in stature, and the towering power of these banned XL bully dogs.""
Paxton said it was a ""ludicrous suggestion"" to say she could be considered a ""fit and proper person"" to control the dogs.
She was attacked within hours of arriving in Jaywick, where Warren had asked her to watch his dogs while he was in London shooting the video.
""Esther suffered dozens and dozens of dog bite marks and wounds, which led to a catastrophic bleed and her death,"" said Paxton, when opening the trial.
Warren had been in a relationship with Martin's daughter Clare for 14 years before she died suddenly in 2021.
He would have been aware of Martin's mobility issues and had ""no basis"" to believe she could ""physically stop the dogs"", Paxton said.
Footage from nearby CCTV, shown to the jury, captured screams coming from the house in Hillman Avenue and dogs barking ""in a frenzied state"".
The animals were so ferocious that police officers chose to Taser them through a smashed window, rather than enter the house, Paxton said.
A doctor was airlifted to the scene but Martin, who suffered at least 60 mostly dog-related injuries, was pronounced dead after being pulled from the property.
But Warren told the jury his XL bullies were ""gentle"" and that ""not in a million years"" could he have predicted them attacking anyone.
He wept at times during the trial, insisting ""happy, lovely"" Martin had never shown any unease about the dogs and that he was ""never going to get over"" her death.
The mauling came two days after it became a criminal offence to own an XL bully in England and Wales without a certificate of exemption.
Warren became the first person to be charged with XL bully-related offences.
Paxton said Warren was aware his dogs were banned but acted as if the law did not apply to him, choosing not to get an exemption certificate or muzzles.
He was released on bail ahead of sentencing.
After the verdict, Det Ch Insp Louise Metcalfe, of Essex Police, said: ""I am pleased that we have been able to ensure Ashley Warren has been held accountable but I know that no verdict will ever bring Esther back.
""I know her death has had, and continues to have, a huge impact on her family and my thoughts are with them today as they continue to grieve the loss of their mother.""
In a statement. Martin's daughters, Sonia and Kelly, said: ""Our mum will be remembered in many ways by many people, but we will remember her for her infectious laugh, comforting smile and wicked sense of humour.""

Arrest after two teens found dead at holiday park,2026-02-19T15:07:50.580Z," Grace McGrory
East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire
","A man has been arrested after two teenagers were found dead at a holiday park in East Yorkshire.
Humberside Police said it was called to Little Eden Holiday Park near Bridlington on Wednesday following concern for safety.
The force said a 15-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy were found dead inside a rental property. A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter and remains in custody.
Ch Supt Matt Peach said: ""Whilst we are in the very early stages and the deaths at this time remain unexplained, we are exploring the possibility that they may be connected to carbon monoxide poisoning, with further inquiries continuing.""
Peach added emergency services and partner agencies had attended all other properties on the site to offer ""advice, support, guidance and ensure everyone's safety"".
He said: ""This is incredibly distressing and heartbreaking for the families of the teenagers involved, and they are at the forefront of our minds and actions.

"Epstein eyed record label investment to access women, files suggest",2026-02-20T01:07:40.097Z," Ben King
Business reporter
","Warning: this article contains offensive and derogatory language
Jeffrey Epstein considered investing in music company EMI after his associate David Stern appeared to suggest it potentially offered access to women, recently released emails suggest.
Stern told the convicted sex offender that the music industry was ""related to P"", a way Epstein apparently often referred to women, in emails newly released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ).
Epstein replied that he was interested, adding: ""Do we need help - mandelson? [sic]""
Stern and Lord Mandelson did not reply to requests for comment.
Stern was a London-based German businessman who was close to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and previously directed the former prince's start-up business competition Pitch@Palace.
He acted as a go-between in negotiations with Mountbatten-Windsor over Sarah Ferguson's money troubles, and has connections to China.
Many of his emails to Epstein flagged potential deals, and in February 2010 he forwarded a short news article about the financial woes of EMI at the time.
EMI is a now-defunct conglomerate that included EMI Records, formerly one of the major players of the music industry. It was acquired by Universal Music in 2012.
""Troubled industry but related to P,"" Stern wrote to Epstein.
""P"", which Epstein apparently used to refer to women, is believed to be an abbreviation of the word ""pussy"", another term Epstein often used.
For birthdays and New Year greetings, Stern wished Epstein ""lots of P"", according to the recently released files. He once offered to get Epstein fashion show tickets ""to review Chinese P"".
He would send Epstein a ""P factor"" for the places he visited, giving the Spanish island Ibiza 9/10, and Sarah Ferguson's 50th birthday party 0.2/10.
At the time Epstein had considered asking Stern for his help in an EMI investment, Lord Mandelson was First Secretary of State and Business Secretary in the UK government.
Stern said it was ""too early to get Mandelson involved before i know more"".
Epstein appears to have emailed Lord Mandelson a few days later, saying: ""please email me bens contact info.. or havehim cal me re emi. [sic]""
In reply, Lord Mandelson appears to say: ""Gave to [redacted]. Email is [redacted]. Talk re EMI ??"".
It's not clear exactly who ""ben"" is.
Epstein sent another reply to Stern, suggesting that if the deal went ahead, he would put US businessman and former Sony Music company CEO Tommy Mottola in charge of it.
He wrote, ""my friend is tommy mottola former head of sony I'd like him to be brought in to fix it"".
Mottola did not reply to a request for comment.
Mottola's name appears more than 700 times in the DOJ's recently released files. An appearance in the Epstein files is not a sign of wrongdoing.
Epstein's proposed deal did not go ahead – and EMI's main lender Citigroup ended up taking control of the company.
However later on, in 2011, Epstein's circle were still discussing a bid for EMI.
Kevin Law, a businessmen in the US state of Connecticut who was often in touch with Epstein, apparently wrote: ""Tell your buddy Andrew from the UK if he's interested in EMI as we discussed I can put him in the syndicate w KKR.""
It is not clear if Epstein's ""buddy"" referred to here is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
Law has said he ""never bid on EMI with any group nor did I ever do a business deal with Epstein,"" and said he did not know the former prince.
The giant private equity firm KKR declined to comment. At the time KKR had a controlling stake in a rival record company, BMG.
Stern was apparently still keen on acquiring a record company in 2011. He wrote: ""EMI may now come up for sale. Could actually be of interest to Chinese if structured properly. Also, most certainly great asset to have for P!""
However Epstein did not buy it then either.
In November 2011, Citigroup split EMI into two parts and, the following year, sold it to Universal and a consortium involving Sony and record executive David Geffen.
The DOJ files show other discussions between Epstein and associates about buying model agencies and fashion-related businesses, which also did not go ahead.
French prosecutors have previously suspected that Epstein used his contact in the fashion industry, Jean-Luc Brunel, to house and transport young girls.

UK has not given US permission to use RAF bases for Iran strikes,2026-02-19T18:00:13.994Z," Jonathan Beale
Defence correspondentandJoe Pike
Political correspondent
","The British government has not given permission for the US to use UK military bases to support potential US strikes on Iran, the BBC understands.
The US has in the past used RAF Fairford, in Gloucestershire, and the UK overseas territory of Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, to carry out strikes in the Middle East region.
The Times reports that US President Donald Trump's latest criticism of Sir Keir Starmer's deal to hand the Chagos Islands over to Mauritius and lease back a joint UK-US military base was prompted by the UK withholding permission to use bases.
A UK government spokesperson said: ""As routine, we do not comment on operational matters.""
The US has been pressuring Iran to agree to curb its nuclear programme.
It has threatened possible strikes if it fails to do so and has moved warships, aircraft and other military assets to the region in preparation for a possible strike.
At the same time, some progress has been reported at talks between American and Iranian negotiators in Switzerland.
On Thursday, Trump said the world would find out ""over the next, probably, 10 days"" whether the US would reach a deal with Iran or take military action.
A UK government spokesperson said: ""There is a political process ongoing between the US and Iran, which the UK supports.
""Iran must never be able to develop a nuclear weapon, and our priority is security in the region.""
Sir Keir spoke to Trump over the phone on Tuesday, after the US government gave its formal support for the Chagos deal.
The Times reports that the pair discussed Trump's ultimatum to Iran over its nuclear programme, and Trump made his statement attacking the Chagos deal the next day.
Insiders believe the Pentagon's preparations for possible strikes on Iran - which could potentially be launched from Diego Garcia - may have shifted the president's understanding of the significance of the island, the largest in the Chagos archipelago.
Trump referenced this in his Truth Social post, saying: ""Should Iran decide not to make a deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the [RAF] Airfield location in Fairford [Gloucestershire], in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime.""
Neither RAF Fairford nor Diego Garcia were used in the US strikes carried out last year on Iran's nuclear facilities.
At the time a senior UK defence source said Washington had not sought permission.
RAF Fairford and other UK military bases were most recently used by the US in support of a military operation to seize the registered tanker known as Bella 1 earlier this year.
But that operation was carried out with the full support of the UK. At the time ministers said the operation was justified under international law.
Questions of international law would likely be applied by the UK government in justifying support for any US military action in Iran.
Under a long-held agreement, the US would have to first request to use any UK sovereign military bases before conducting military operations.
Under international law, there is no distinction between a state carrying out the attack and those which have supported that state, if the latter has ""knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act"".
In January, the BBC's political editor Chris Mason asked Sir Keir whether he supported a potential US strike on Iran.
At the time, the prime minister replied he was talking to allies about how to prevent Iran from developing nuclear activities and killing protesters.
""The aim here is that Iran shouldn't be able to develop nuclear weapons. That's hugely important,"" he said.
""And of course we need to deal with the fact that they are repressing protesters, killing protesters. It's grotesque what is happening. And so that's where our focus is and we're working with allies to that end.""
Reacting to the latest developments, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, a long-standing Trump critic, said: ""It's now clear Donald Trump is trying to bully the government into letting the US use UK bases like Diego Garcia to pursue unilateral military action.
""Keir Starmer needs to stand strong and give Parliament a vote on the use of UK bases by US forces.""

Lobbying firm co-founded by Mandelson on brink of collapse,2026-02-19T19:49:30.416Z," Theo Leggett
Business correspondent
","Global Counsel, the lobbying firm co-founded by Peter Mandelson, has confirmed it is preparing to enter administration on Friday.
Staff have reportedly been told the move became inevitable when leading clients severed their relationships with the company, after details emerged of apparent links with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Lord Mandelson resigned from the board of Global Counsel in 2024, though he remained a shareholder until earlier this month. His co-founder, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, stepped down as chief executive on 6 February.
Sources close to the company insist its difficulties stem entirely from ""the Mandelson legacy"" and not from any actions by staff.
Global Counsel warned there will be ""a significant number of redundancies being made by the administrators when they take control of the company"" on Friday.
The lobbying firm was set up by Lord Mandelson and Wegg-Prosser after Labour lost the 2010 general election.
It became a highly influential lobbying firm in Westminster, advising high-profile clients such as Shell, TikTok and Barclays.
The company employs more than 100 people and has offices in Berlin, Brussels, Singapore, Washington DC and Doha.
However, its future was thrown into question following the publication of documents from the Epstein files, which cast light on Lord Mandelson's links with the disgraced financier.
In a statement on Thursday, Global Counsel said ""many clients"" had remained loyal to the firm in recent weeks.
But it added: ""The continuing maelstrom of political and media attention surrounding Peter Mandelson has made it challenging to continue with the business in its current form.
""The administrators-in-waiting have already indicated that, in the unlikely event that any ongoing servicing of clients is viable, this will be on a limited basis only.""
The files also contained mentions of a meeting between Wegg-Prosser and Epstein in 2010, two years after the latter's conviction for soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor.
Epstein died in New York in 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Lord Mandelson is credited as one of the key architects of the New Labour movement, which came to power with Tony Blair's election victory in 1997.
He served in several ministerial posts under Blair and Gordon Brown, as well as being European commissioner for trade from 2004-2008.
He was appointed ambassador to the US in December 2024, but was fired in September after the extent of his relationship with Epstein became clear.
Earlier this month, two properties linked to Lord Mandelson were searched by police following allegations of misconduct in public office.
Lord Mandelson has been contacted for comment but has not responded. The BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.

Starmer appoints Romeo as head of UK civil service,2026-02-19T15:49:43.445Z," Joe Pike
Political correspondent
","Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has appointed Dame Antonia Romeo as cabinet secretary, the UK's top civil servant.
Dame Antonia will be the first woman to hold the post in the role's 110-year history.
She faced multiple bullying complaints earlier in her career but government sources have told the BBC that Sir Keir was impressed by her ability to ""get things done"".
The government has previously said three allegations relating to Dame Antonia's use of expenses and bullying of staff when she was the UK's consul general in New York were investigated and there was ""no case to answer"".
The cabinet secretary is the prime minister's most senior policy adviser and sits next to them during cabinet minister meetings, which usually take place weekly in Downing Street when Parliament is sitting.
They are responsible for ensuring policy decisions are put into action and is ultimately responsible for all civil servants in Great Britain.
Dame Antonia has a long track record of leading government departments including spells as permanent secretary at the Home Office, International Trade and the Ministry of Justice.
Her appointment was made following a due diligence process overseen by crossbench peer Baroness Gisela Stuart, the First Civil Service Commissioner.
Sir Keir said Dame Antonia is an ""outstanding public servant, with a 25‑year record of delivering for the British people"".
He said: ""Since becoming prime minister, I've been impressed by her professionalism and determination to get things done.""
Dame Antonia said it was a ""huge privilege"" to be appointed, adding: ""The Civil Service is a great and remarkable institution, which I love.
""We should be known for delivery, efficiency and innovation, working to implement the government's agenda and meet the challenges the country faces.""
Dame Antonia, a University of Oxford graduate, joined the Civil Service in 2000 as an economist after previously working for a consultancy firm in the private sector.
Her high-ranking jobs included serving as the UK's consul general in New York between 2016 and 2017.
Dame Antonia's job involved promoting UK trade and business in New York, which saw her pictured with celebrities, shortly after the referendum to take Britain out of the EU.
Concerns were raised about Dame Antonia's use of social media, with one former colleague claiming in an email that she seemed to be ""focusing an undue amount on building her personal Twitter brand"".
Dame Antonia replaces Sir Chris Wormald, who was forced out as cabinet secretary last week after serving in the job for just 14 months.
Sir Chris is the shortest serving cabinet secretary in history.
His departure came after months of negative media reports suggesting Downing Street was unhappy with his performance.
At the time of his appointment, the prime minister said Sir Chris would be tasked with ""the complete re-wiring of the British state to deliver bold and ambitious long-term reform"".
As a career civil servant, some questioned whether he was the best person to reform the Civil Service.
Sir Chris also had ultimate responsibility for the due diligence checks carried out before Lord Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador, although he took up the role only a few days before the appointment was formally announced.
Lord Mandelson was sacked from the role last September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein had emerged.
The FDA union for senior civil servants criticised the anonymous briefings against Sir Chris.
Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokesperson Lisa Smart, responding to Dame Antonia's appointment, said the public are ""tired of the endless sniping and the revolving door of officials"".
She said: ""It's time to stop the Downing Street drama and start delivering for the country.""
Reform UK said it would break the role into three if it entered government.
They have proposed: a cabinet secretary responsible for the process of cabinet and cabinet committee meetings; a Civil Service leader; and a chief adviser to the prime minister, who would be a political appointee.
Reform UK MP Danny Kruger said the current combined role ""is far too much executive responsibility for a single civil servant, and helps explain the chronic bureaucracy and misgovernment of Britain"".

Cats may hold clues for human cancer treatment,2026-02-20T01:04:25.868Z," Helen Briggs
Science correspondent
","The first detailed genetic map of cancer in pet cats reveals striking similarities with human versions of the disease, possibly helping find new ways to treat cancers in both.
Scientists analysed tumour DNA from almost 500 domestic cats, uncovering key genetic mutations linked with the condition.
Cancer is one of the main causes of illness and death in cats, however, very little is known about how it develops.
""Cat cancer genetics has totally been a black box up until now,"" said lead researcher, Dr Louise Van der Wayden. ""The more we can understand about cancer in any species has got to be beneficial for everybody.""
The international team led by the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge examined around 1,000 genes linked to 13 types of feline cancer.
They found many of the genes driving cat cancers are mirrored in humans, suggesting the two species share key biological processes that allow tumours to grow and spread.
The scientists say the household cat could hold the key to understanding certain types of breast cancer, such as triple negative breast cancer. Around 15 out of 100 breast cancers are of this type.
Cats develop this subtype more often than humans, giving scientists access to samples, and offering clues to new medicines that might help in treatment.

Almost a quarter of UK households own at least one cat, making the animal almost as popular as dogs as a trusted companion.
But while cancer studies have been carried out extensively in dogs, cats have remained unexplored.
The scientists say both household pets could give clues to environmental factors involved in some types of cancer.
They share the same spaces as us, meaning that they are also exposed to the same environmental factors that we are.
""This can help us understand more about why cancer develops in cats and humans, how the world around us influences cancer risk, and possibly find new ways to prevent and treat it,"" said Prof Geoffrey Wood of the Ontario Veterinary College, Canada.
The research is published in the journal, Science.

"Climber survives 1,500ft fall before running four miles for help",2026-02-19T13:09:21.649Z," Jonathan Geddes
BBC Scotland
","An Ayrshire man has said he is lucky to be alive after falling more than 1,500ft off Goat Fell mountain on Arran - and then running for miles to find help.
Callum Laird plunged off the mountain due to icy conditions, and although he managed to break his descent at points by clinging to rocks, the 25-year-old eventually dropped onto a grassy marsh.
He only realised the extent of his injuries when he encountered a woman and her daughter, having left a trail of blood along a hiking trail.
Callum was taken to Arran War Memorial Hospital, where he was treated for his injuries. He suffered only superficial burns, a chipped ankle and an injured shin.
This article contains images which some viewers may find upsetting.
Experienced marathon runner Callum, from Cumnock was scaling Goat Fell last Saturday as part of his training for the upcoming Trans Gran Canaria ultramarathon.
He hoped climbing the Arran peak could replicate some of the conditions he expects to find in Spain, but found parts of the mountain covered in ice.
He told BBC Scotland News: ""It was when I started to turn back that I went into free fall off the side of the mountain.
""I managed to catch a rock about halfway down. I was dangling off it, trying to find a phone to call mountain rescue, but couldn't find it. I was there for two minutes and already starting to get cold.
""I noticed there was blood there, but I put that to the back of my mind, and decided I would need to aim for the softest landing I could see.
""That was another 800ft or so, and I eventually landed in a grassy marsh.""
When Callum landed he knew that if he remained there, his condition would only get worse, and during the fall his phone had been lost.
After checking he had not broken any bones, he hauled himself up and started heading in the direction of the Glen Rosa ferry terminal miles away, intending to travel off the isle.
Callum's partner Nicole works at Crosshouse hospital in Kilmarnock, and he planned to go and see her.
He told BBC Scotland his memories were blurry about some of the incident, but after going through a couple of river crossings and marshes he got onto the Glen Rosa trail path and started running for about three or four miles.
He added: ""I could feel my right ankle starting to seize up but I kept going. I met this woman on the trail, and it turned out her husband is a doctor with the mountain rescue team.
""She was with her daughter and they gave me a cup of tea and wrapped me in blankets – they told me I looked like I was going to die.""
Despite this, Callum was still insisting he would get the ferry and head home, despite being at risk of hypothermia.
""The woman was determined I wasn't, and that I'd go to hospital, and when I got to the car I looked behind and saw this trail of blood behind me.""
It was only when he reached hospital that Callum realised the danger he was in, as medics rushed to treat him.
The following day he was airlifted to Crosshouse, and then discharged that night.
His burns are now starting to heal, and will see how his recovery goes before deciding whether he can take part in the Trans Gran Canaria event.
However, he is keen that other climbers are aware of the incident and are aware of the risks in climbing a mountain when it is icy.
He explained: ""You should always go with somebody or make sure there is someone that knows your route.
""It might seem a bit much but always make sure you have proper equipment, because if I'd had an ice axe with me I could have pulled myself back up.
""I had poles on me but they were no use with the ice. It might be an extra weight, but it could be something that saves your life.
""I can't believe I'm still alive, to be honest.""

BBC plans David Attenborough celebration for 100th birthday,2026-02-19T09:20:22.128Z," Steven McIntosh
Entertainment reporter
","Sir David Attenborough's 100th birthday will be celebrated with three special programmes, the BBC has announced.
The corporation will mark Sir David's ""extraordinary milestone"" on 8 May with a week of special programming featuring new and old shows by the beloved presenter.
One of the new programmes, titled Making Life on Earth: Attenborough's Greatest Adventure, will go behind the scenes of his landmark BBC One series.
Life on Earth was first broadcast in 1979 and followed Sir David as he travelled to 40 countries to film 600 species.
The new programme will feature new interviews of the wildlife broadcaster and the original production team as they reflect on the making of the series.
It will also touch on the challenges they faced along the way, including a coup in the Comoros, being shot at, as well as Sir David's famous encounter with gorillas in Rwanda.
Sir David will also appear in a new series, Secret Garden, in which he will reveal the hidden worlds within Britain's gardens.
Over five episodes filmed across the UK, the series will capture the rich diversity of life in Britain's back gardens while also reflecting on how the public can do their bit to save struggling species.
And the presenter will appear in David Attenborough's 100 Years on Planet Earth, a live event from the Royal Albert Hall featuring the BBC Concert Orchestra and special guests.
The week will also revisit episodes from Sir David's most-loved series including Planet Earth, One Planet, Blue Planet, Frozen Planet, Planet Earth and his most recent special Wild London.
Jack Bootle, head of commissioning for specialist factual at the BBC, said: ""It's impossible to overstate what Sir David Attenborough has given us.
""His programmes have not only defined science and natural history broadcasting, but they have also changed how we see our planet and our place within it.
""This special week is a celebration of an extraordinary milestone and of a body of work that continues to inspire awe, curiosity and care for the natural world.
""It's also a moment for all of us at the BBC to say thank you to David - for his generosity, for his brilliance and for a lifetime spent bringing the wonders of nature into our homes.""

"Shell-shocked, haunted photo of Andrew will be part of how arrest is remembered",2026-02-19T22:14:44.147Z," Sean Coughlan
Royal correspondent
","The shell-shocked, disbelieving, haunted face of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor will become part of how his arrest will be remembered.
It's not a particularly edifying sight. Andrew is slumped in the back seat of a car after his release, fingers steepled, whether in prayer or protection.
His collar is up. For that matter, his collar has been felt. Was Andrew's expression of shock how he looked when he had a mugshot photo taken in police custody?
It'll become the counterpart of that other famous Andrew picture, taken almost 25 years ago, of a smiling confident prince, beside a 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre in a London townhouse, when the capital was his playground.
Earlier, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had become the first senior member of the Royal Family in modern history to have been arrested. It was another catch your breath moment.
It was followed by an unprecedented statement from his brother, King Charles. ""Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,"" read the unambiguous statement from the King, offering no hiding place or royal get-out clause.
The arrest, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, relates to Andrew's time as the UK's trade representative between 2001 and 2011. It follows a series of allegations, prompted by the release of the Epstein files, that Andrew shared official documents.
That included sharing reports from trade visits and a confidential briefing on investment in Afghanistan with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and passing a Treasury briefing to a personal business contact.
Being a member of the Royal Family will make no legal difference to how his case is assessed.
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein.
The no-nonsense police statement on Thursday morning was a bluntly worded news earthquake: ""The man remains in police custody at this time.""
Whoever thought we'd read that sentence when the man in question is still in the line of succession to the throne, and in theory, if not in practice, remains a counsellor of state?
Andrew's explanation of his behaviour won't be in a TV interview. The public will not have forgotten the BBC's Newsnight interview, which remains the last time Andrew spoke publicly about his relationship with Epstein.
This time, it will have been in the presence of a lawyer and the investigating officers, rather than under the TV lights, and the consequences of any untruths will be much more serious.
The action by the police on a winter's morning in Norfolk was remarkable breaking news - and also appeared to have taken the King by surprise as much as anyone else.
But the story of Andrew's links to Epstein has been decades in the making - and so has Andrew's downfall, first chipping away at his reputation before turning into an avalanche of disgrace.
The association with Epstein meant Andrew lost his trade envoy role in 2011, and after that disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019 he was removed as a working royal.
His retreat from public life became even more complete after his 2022 settlement with his accuser Virginia Giuffre.
And in October last year, as emails revealed that Andrew hadn't ended his links with Epstein when he had claimed, he was stripped of his prince and duke titles, and eventually shuffled out of his Royal Lodge home at Windsor.
They were tough sanctions, removing any vestige of royal status.
The Palace has had some nervous moments in recent times, with questions shouted by hecklers suggesting they might be protecting Andrew.
The statement from the King will have sought to draw a line under this and separate the Royal Family from whatever might happen to Andrew.
Another important factor in all of this is the public mood. The Epstein files, and what they have revealed regarding a network of those apparently high in connections but low on morals, have left people feeling angry at such unaccountable power and wealth.
It has felt abusive to the public, that the rich and influential appear to have been immune from the consequences of their behaviour, be it in terms of either sex or money. It has seemed to the public that corruption paid.
Making the arrest even more resonant is that it happened on Andrew's 66th birthday. Any candles would have to wait.
There are references to Andrew's previous birthdays in the Epstein files, such as a glitzy bash for his 50th at St James's Palace.
One person who had to turn down the invite for that night of ""mysterious mischief"" was Jeffrey Epstein, who was still under house arrest as part of a sentence for procuring a minor for prostitution.
Andrew celebrated his birthday 12 months ago as Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Knight of the Garter. Who knows what will have changed by his next birthday.

He told police his XL bullies were friendly – days later his mother-in-law was mauled to death,2026-02-19T20:00:09.834Z," Lewis Adams
Essex
","When the police visited Ashley Warren's home in Jaywick, Essex, he told them his XL bully dogs were misunderstood, even suggesting they were less vicious than a poodle.
Yet 10 days later, and two days after their ownership became illegal without a certificate of exemption, they mauled his mother-in-law to death.
Esther Martin, 68, had been left in the property with the two dogs, eight puppies and a child while Warren filmed a music video in London on 3 February 2024.
The amateur rapper was alerted to screams coming from his property in Hillman Avenue and demanded ""someone that's strong, really strong"" went immediately.
But it was too late. Martin suffered ""dozens and dozens"" of catastrophic bites and was dead within minutes.
Warren, 41, was arrested upon his return to Clacton railway station and became the first person in the UK to be charged with XL bully-related offences.
He has now been found guilty of owning one of the dogs, called Bear, responsible for killing Martin.
He was cleared of being in charge of the other dog, Beauty, which also injured Martin, but belonged to his girlfriend.
Martin travelled from Woodford Green in east London to Warren's house, arriving just before lunchtime on the day she was killed.
Her daughter, Clare, had been in a relationship with Warren for 14 years before she died suddenly in 2021.
Prosecutors at Chelmsford Crown Court said leaving Martin with the dogs was ""a tragedy waiting to happen"".
The 5ft 3in (1.6m) grandmother had a history of medical complaints and was waiting for a second hip replacement. She also had arthritis and a limp.
She was attacked within a few hours of arriving, and Ring doorbell footage played during the trial captured her screams.
Warren had been well aware of the dogs' power. He was caught on CCTV chasing after Bear after an escape from his house on 31 January 2024.
The video showed him struggling to hold on to Bear, who weighed 47kg (7st 4lb).
The day before, Warren wrote in a message that the animals were ""too much for me"".
""How did the defendant expect Esther Martin to control the dogs?"" prosecutor Christopher Paxton KC asked the jury.
Police had visited Warren's house a week before, where he made several unprompted comments about his XL bullies.
""It's a shame about all the laws and all of that,"" he told an officer, also lying to say he already had exemption paperwork for Bear, who he bought on Gumtree.
""I'm telling you it's a shame what everyone thinks about them and everything, man, because they are one of the friendliest dogs that I know.""
He said having a negative perception of XL bullies was ""mad to me"" and insisted poodles were ""more aggressive"".
Giving evidence during the trial, he wept as videos of his 10 dogs were played.
But jurors were told Warren was aware the dogs were too strong even for his girlfriend at the time to walk - and police noted they ignored his instructions during their visit.
Dog behaviour expert Dr Candy D'Sa told the trial Martin suffered level six bites when attacked - ranked as the most serious.
She said Warren's dogs were kept in an ""impoverished environment"" and had not been walked for four weeks before the incident, making them ""incredibly frustrated"".
The jury heard Martin was using a broom to stop the puppies fighting when Beauty and Bear knocked her over and attacked.
Such was their ferocity that police feared they would be killed if they entered the house, instead opting to Taser the dogs through a smashed window.
Paxton described there being a vast imbalance of strength between Martin and the dogs' ""towering power"".
Bear and Beauty were put down at the scene, and the puppies were later destroyed.
Warren, described as an ""aspiring rap artist"", was recording a music video in London when he heard about the attack.
He published songs after Martin's death, although no direct reference to the incident was made. The impact, however, is evident.
In the first track released in August 2024, he rapped: ""So much [explicit] is happening and so much [explicit] has happened.
""But I still can't imagine all the things that have happened, but it feels like yesterday.""
Pictures of Warren's XL bully puppies feature in the video during this part of the song.
He also continued posting videos and messages to more than 700 Facebook followers in the build-up to his trial.
One showed a card written to ""Ester"" (sic), while another revealed he had written ""miss you lots xx always x"".
While giving evidence, he insisted he could not have predicted ""in a million years"" his ""gentle"" dogs killing someone.
Warren told the jury he was ""never going to get over"" Martin's death.
Warren was also found guilty of possessing a knife when he was arrested after getting a train from London to Clacton-on-Sea.
He had claimed it was a prop from his music video.
He is due to be sentenced on 1 April.

Why there's no quick fix in sight for the problem of dazzling headlights,2026-02-19T09:43:37.095Z," Katy Austin
Transport correspondent
","When Jane Kingsbury, 80, last had her eyes tested, she says her optician told her that her eyesight was OK. But Jane, from Cambridge, says she is giving up driving at night because the feeling of being ""dazzled"" by other vehicles has left her feeling unsafe. ""I am worried about the glare from oncoming lights,"" she says.
And when Jane mentioned this at a discussion group she attends, others felt the same. ""Over 90% of us did not want to drive in the dark,"" says Jane. ""So we have changed the time of our meetings from 7.30pm to 1.30pm [for much of the year] so that we can drive home before dark.""
Jane and her friends aren't alone. In a debate at Westminster last October, MPs voiced widespread concerns about bright headlights. Some described social isolation among constituents who had become too scared to drive in the dark.
The RAC motoring organisation, which has campaigned on headlight dazzle, has repeatedly asked its members for their views. Most recently, more than half of respondents to a survey of 1,745 UK drivers in January this year felt the problem had worsened in the past 12 months. A third of those who said they were affected by dazzle said they felt less safe when driving at night.
It's not only older drivers who feel this way. Emily McGuire from Essex told the BBC: ""I am in my 30s and sometimes I can't tell if [other vehicles'] main beam is on or off and once they have passed, I can't see properly for a good few minutes, it's terrible.""
She owns a smaller car and feels that she can't avoid the lights on higher, bigger cars: ""I suffer with migraines when a car approaches me with extremely bright lights, I have to look down or in the other direction… I also have to slow right down when it's really dark and I'm on a country lane.""
And experts say the problem is getting worse. Denise Voon, clinical advisor at the College of Optometrists - which also campaigns on the issue - says: ""I am a practising optometrist and I've noticed that maybe 15 years ago, you rarely had people coming in complaining about headlight glare. But now it's becoming more and more prevalent.""
It's an issue that has even reached the United Nations - it will mandate all new cars to automatically adjust their headlight levels.
But this will only affect new cars. And so the questions many are asking are: what, if anything, can be done about all the cars currently out there causing headlight discomfort - and why did nobody spot that this might be a problem?
Experts believe a number of factors can cause headlight dazzle.
One is the angle of headlights. If misaligned, they are more likely to cause glare. Misalignment can cause a vehicle to fail its MoT test.
Then there's the fact that headlights have got brighter, to help drivers see better.
Headlights have moved a long way from the ""kind of brown glow"" produced by filament bulbs decades ago, according to Dale Harrow, professor of Intelligent Mobility and Car Design at the Royal College of Art in London. They have become more complex and ""a design object in their own right,"" he says.
Glass casings have given way to plastic and significantly, the light source has changed too, with most people now using LEDs instead of halogen bulbs, he says - the quality has improved and lights are now ""brighter, but also a lot clearer"".
While this ""has to be a good thing"" when it comes to helping the driver see clearly, Harrow says, it has also resulted in ""unplanned drawbacks"" - including dazzling other road users.
Another problem is the illegal retrofitting of LED bulbs, especially when fitted into units designed for halogen. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency has said it has stepped up a crackdown on retrofit bulbs, with sellers facing potential fines of up to £1,000.
""Recent advances in headlight technology have improved visibility but all headlights – whether LED or not – must still be aimed correctly and checked at the MOT test,"" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
Our eyes adapt in the dark to become a lot more sensitive to light, says Denise Voon. As a result, being suddenly hit by very bright lights can temporarily make it very hard to see, even causing pain.
Retinal cells at the back of the eyes which detect the light can get bleached, and take a while to recover. That's when people notice an imprint remaining in their vision after looking away.
Although headlight glare does affect younger people, age is thought to be a factor. Older people are more prone to conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma, for example.
Voon says there are a number of reasons why LEDs may be particularly problematic. Firstly, they are two to three times as bright as traditional halogens, and their ""colour temperature"" is bluer and whiter, which mimics natural daylight.
Also, LED lights ""are a lot more directional, so you've got this much brighter, whiter light in a very directional point hitting your eye compared to the more diffuse halogen ones"".
It's not clear if it is the brightness, colour, temperature or the direction of the lights - or some combination of all of these - that causes most problems, she says: ""But what we know is that's one of the differences.""
Despite widespread concerns that the problem is getting worse, there isn't evidence that brighter lights are causing more accidents.
Statistics from the Department for Transport (DfT) show that headlight dazzle was recorded as a contributory factor in 216 collisions in 2023. Four of those collisions were fatal.
Although the overall number of collisions rose very slightly compared to the previous year, it was far below the 330 recorded in 2014. The figure was also lower than any of the intervening years except 2020, when the pandemic meant fewer drivers on the roads.
But the fact that since 2024 ""vision affected by dazzling headlights"" is no longer listed in the DfT's published statistics as a contributory factor in its own right, makes comparisons or identification of a trend harder.
Equally, these statistics don't tell us whether some people are choosing not to drive at night and nor do they account for other changes in driver behaviour.
Still, a government-commissioned report by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), published last year, found that drivers ""perceived glare from vehicle headlamps to be an important and widespread issue when driving at night"".
It also concluded that headlamps were perceived as ""too bright"", and that ""whiter"" headlamps and those on larger vehicles were ""generally perceived to be especially problematic for causing glare"".
So far so obvious, you may think, based on what campaigners have been saying for some time. But the study went further.
Researchers took out a car at night, rigged with equipment to measure light intensity and an observer in the vehicle could press a button if they felt glare might interfere with their driving.
The study drew a link between higher levels of luminance - meaning the intensity of light - and the likelihood of experiencing glare. It also suggested that 40,000 candela per sq m - a measure of luminance - may be an ""important threshold for the experience of glare being more likely"".
Also, when the research car was travelling uphill or around a right-hand bend, glare was more likely, researchers said - a driver's eyes are more likely to fall within the ""throw"" of headlamps from oncoming vehicles.
Echoing the concerns of experts, researchers also found ""some tentative indication that larger body shapes such as SUVs and models with light-emitting diode (LED) headlamps may be more likely to be associated with glare"". However, further research was recommended in this area.
The government has since agreed to conduct such further research. But this has not started yet, and it's unlikely to begin for at least a couple of months.
But all this raises the question of why nobody anticipated widespread complaints about glare - in spite of all the research and development work that's been carried out by carmakers around the world. ""It seems more priority has been put on giving drivers the best possible view of the road at night and less on the consequences for oncoming traffic,"" says Simon Williams, the RAC's head of policy.
Manufacturers reject this. ""Safety is every car maker's top priority and providing good visibility to drivers in darkened conditions is essential,"" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. ""All headlights must meet international standards so drivers can see as clearly as possible but without dazzling other drivers.""
In October, I had the opportunity to speak to Thomas Broberg, senior advisor for safety at Volvo's Car Safety Centre in Gothenburg, Sweden. He explained how vehicles have to meet the standards of countries in which the manufacturer wants to sell them - vehicle manufacturing being an international business.
There are regulations around the headlights themselves, he says, covering their shape, intensity and glare. Also, headlights are tested on the road by different authorities and ""as a global car company, we need to comply with all of them"".
Broberg said it was a ""concern"" that people are complaining about glare, but insisted that avoiding glare was part of the design process. He also pushed back against the suggestion that SUVs end up dazzling people more. ""The angle of the light is actually regulated,"" he says. ""So if you have a higher vehicle, then you need to have a lower [beam] angle.""
He argues that road geometry, and poor aiming of headlights in cars that don't have automatic levelling systems, are more likely culprits.
In theory, technological innovations should help, particularly auto-dimming - although not everyone finds that they dip early enough.
Off the back of the TRL report, the government has promised to look further into design factors that may be contributing to glare. The idea would be to use the findings to propose changes to international regulations at the United Nations.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has a World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. Following an agreement by this forum, new vehicles are meant to have mandatory automatic headlight levelling by September 2027. The effect of this technology is to correct the aim of headlights if the vehicle's load changes.
But this would not change the headlight settings on the millions of cars on our roads already.
The TRL report also points out that ""many instances of glare are likely to remain even with stronger regulation"", because real-world situations of ""road geometry"" - the shape of the road, with ups, downs and corners - are not realistically under DfT's control.
""We know headlamp glare is a real frustration for many drivers and is even discouraging some from driving at night,"" a DfT spokesperson says. ""That's why we're investigating the causes as part of our Road Safety Strategy and are pressing for improvements to international lighting regulations.""
There are some basic things drivers can do to reduce the impact bright lights have on them. For example, keep their windscreen clean, inside and out.
The College of Optometrists reminds motorists to always wear glasses if they have them, and make sure they are clean. It also advises staying up to date with vision tests, which can also pick up problems with eye health.
More practical advice when confronted with bright oncoming headlights is to briefly look to the side of the road, keeping your eyes open - and of course, be considerate of other drivers when you're behind the wheel yourself.
For Emily and others affected by glare, this guidance will have to make do for the time being. She says: ""It's tough but we cope and carry on until something is done about it.""

'The arrogance of XL bully owner killed our mum',2026-02-20T05:26:51.945Z," Lewis AdamsandNicola Haseler
Essex
","Warning: This article contains distressing content
The daughters of a woman mauled to death by XL bully dogs said the arrogance of the owner of one of the animals was to blame for the killing.
Esther Martin was attacked at her son-in-law Ashley Warren's home in Jaywick, Essex, on 3 February 2024.
She suffered ""dozens and dozens"" of bite wounds, which led to a catastrophic bleed. The 68-year-old was fatally injured just two days after the dogs were banned in England and Wales.
""Who would deserve to be ripped apart by two dogs, knowing that's what is happening?"" Sonia Martin-Coppen, 49, told the BBC.
Martin had travelled from Woodford Green in east London to be at the property, where there were two adult XL bullies – called Beauty and Bear – and eight puppies.
There was also a child at the house.
Warren, a 41-year-old aspiring rapper, had asked Martin to look after the dogs that day while he went to London to film a music video.
Footage from a nearby CCTV camera, shown to the jury at Chelmsford Crown Court, captured screams coming from the house in Hillman Avenue and dogs barking ""in a frenzied state"" at about 15:30 GMT.
Warren was found guilty of owning or being in charge of Bear and possessing a knife at Chelmsford Crown Court on Thursday.
""She had raised concerns about the dogs,"" Martin-Coppen said.
""The fact they were big; the fact they were XLs; the fact they were banned; the fact they were not under control and would jump up at people.""
Martin's other daughter, Kelly Fretwell, said her mother had ""waddled"" when she walked, had a limp, arthritis and had undergone two hip replacements.
The combined weight of all 10 dogs inside Warren's house had been up to 190kg (29st 13lb), prosecutors had told the jury.
""It didn't take a brain surgeon or a rocket scientist to know that she was not a fit and able person [to care for the dogs],"" Fretwell said.
Martin-Coppen added: ""We are not talking small animals. We are talking pure muscle, pure power, untrained, cooped up in a small house.""
The animals were so ferocious, police officers chose to Taser them through a smashed window rather than go into the house, the trial had heard.
Prosecutors said Warren had made no attempt to get an exemption certificate for his XL bullies ahead of the dogs being banned.
They had not been walked for four weeks before the attack and a dog behaviour expert had described conditions inside Warren's home as ""impoverished"".
Martin-Coppen said: ""They shouldn't have been in the property; they should have been rehomed.
""Mr Warren's arrogance is what caused this. It's not lack of knowledge – he knew the law was coming in.""
Warren had been in a 14-year relationship with another of Martin's daughters, Clare, who had died suddenly in 2021, aged 29.
Esther Martin was described by her daughters as having had an ""infectious laugh"" and grand sense of humour.
They said she had just been ""regaining her life"" after Clare's death.
""It was the first time in a long time she was starting to feel positive,"" Martin-Coppen said. ""Warren's actions by not being a responsible dog owner directly impacted that day.""
Warren, now of Addlestone in Surrey, was the first person to be prosecuted under XL bully ban.
He will be sentenced on 1 April.

My life changed in an instant after terminal diagnosis,2026-02-20T00:01:34.263Z," Aileen Moynagh
Health reporter
BBC News NI
","When Patrick Malone was diagnosed with a rare type of incurable cancer in May 2024 ""absolutely every aspect"" of his life changed in an instant.
""It was heartbreaking and very scary because you realise fairly quickly that it's terminal and the prognosis is suspect,"" he said.
Almost two years on, he said a new support service for people like him who are living with mesothelioma has been ""invaluable"" for him and his family in dealing with the diagnosis.
Access to immunotherapy treatment means the 66-year-old's cancer has reduced and is now stable, something he said ""buys me a lot of time"".
Mesothelioma is typically associated with exposure to asbestos but, while there is no cure, early access to specialist nursing and coordinated care can make a significant difference.
It's something Patrick said was ""a big plus point at the time when there really wasn't any plus points"".
""Nobody will realise how good [the service] is until maybe they either get cancer or know somebody that has it,"" he said. ""And then it becomes apparent and very much needs to be built into your new life living with the disease.""
A retired civil servant, Patrick said he never worked with asbestos during his career, but looking back he said there was a role in one government building in particular that involved him going up and down to a ""really dusty and really murky"" basement which stored files.
The building was later closed after asbestos was found.
The use of asbestos in building was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays, but materials containing it are still found in many older buildings.
""I assume my time there has exposed me to asbestos dust on more than one occasion,"" he said.
He has submitted a claim for compensation, but said it was ""hard to take"" that doing his job ""most likely"" resulted in him being diagnosed with cancer.
Carol Johnston, one of only two mesothelioma clinical nurse specialists in Northern Ireland, said the timeline from exposure to diagnosis can be challenging for patients to come to terms with as many will has ""maybe contracted [mesothelioma] through their day-to-day work, maybe 30 or 40 years ago"".
""It can feel like a late diagnosis, but it's not - it's just prolonged in how it behaves and how it presents itself.""
Ms Johnston works with Stephanie Todd to provide regional support services to patients and their families in the form of specialist clinical advice, emotional support, and practical information.
The service began in September 2024, bringing Northern Ireland in line with care offered across the rest of the UK.
Since then, it has received more than 60 referrals for people like Patrick from across the region.
He said it has been an ""open door"" for help and reassurance.
""I'm fortunate that, even though I've got this disease, I'm getting the very best of treatment, the very best of care,"" he said.
Until recently mesothelioma patients would have ""potentially fallen into other specialities, or have had a long pathway to diagnosis"", but Ms Todd said this, combined with the ""sheer impact of the diagnosis itself"", illustrates why a dedicated service is needed.
As it is a terminal illness, Ms Johnston said they would be treating their patients with palliative care from diagnosis through to end of life, but having a designated nurse can give patients more individualised support.
""The palliative aspect means that we are managing symptoms and supporting patients and providing a service that we can help them have a quality of life - that they can live as well as possible for as long as possible by whatever way that is,"" she said.
As well as providing emotional support, the specialist nurses help patients navigate their journey offering insight into treatment plans, guidance when filling in forms, help with travel insurance, or to talk to about scan results.
The initiative is run by the charity Mesothelioma UK, which first began it's work in Northern Ireland after being contacted by the Rodgers family who lost their father Tony to mesothelioma on New Year's Day 2022.
Niamh Rodgers said having the clinical nurse specialists is ""invaluable"" for patients and their families, adding it will provide a new level of care and expertise for mesothelioma patients.
""We are very proud of what we have achieved and the stage that we are at,"" she said.
""It is something that we could only have dreamt of four years ago whenever daddy passed away.
""We know that he'd be very proud of what we have achieved.""
Mesothelioma is a type of incurable cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body's organs, according to the NHS.
It's typically associated with asbestos and usually develops more than 20 years after exposure.
Mesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lungs, although it can also affect the lining of the stomach, heart or testicles.
The UK has the highest incidence of mesothelioma in the world, with around 2,700 people diagnosed each year – about 50 of those are in Northern Ireland.

Bumper ski season but also avalanches in Scotland's snowy hills,2026-02-20T05:59:00.967Z," Steven McKenzie
BBC Highlands and Islands reporter
","Scotland's mountain snowsports centres say they have been enjoying their best winter in six years.
Glenshee has been open since the end of December and the resort said conditions in the last three weeks had been ""fantastic"".
Glencoe Mountain said it was proving to be the best season since the Covid pandemic hit in March 2020, while Cairngorm Mountain described it as a ""great year"" so far.
Away from the slopes, heavy snow and high winds have increased the avalanche risk on some of Scotland's highest mountains.
The Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) has already recorded three times the number of avalanches it noted for the whole of last season, with almost 100 of them in the last month.
Scotland's mountain snowsports resorts have previously endured some difficult seasons because of disappointing conditions including those in 2016-17 and 2018-19.
Nevis Range had to delay the start to its 2024-25 winter season until the arrival of more snow.
This winter, snow and several days of calm weather have allowed all Scotland's mountain centres to open for snowsports, though high winds have caused some disruption - and milder weather has been forecast for the weekend.
Glencoe Mountain boss Andy Meldrum said the site had more than 1,000 skiers and about 600 sledgers on Tuesday.
He said: ""Best season since Covid. We have been open for skiing now since early January.
""Almost all runs and uplift on the mountain are open.""
Friday is a significant day for the resort. It is 70 years since the first ski tow ran in Scotland, which was in the Main Basin at Glencoe.
David Farquharson, managing director at Glenshee, near Braemar, said conditions had been ""fantastic"" from about three weeks ago.
He said it had come just at the right time for schools' February half term break.
""Busiest day so far has been 2,500 people. Certainly already better than any since being shutdown for Covid,"" said Farquharson.
He said the big difference over the last 50 days was that the centre had been able to open up more runs than just its beginners' area.
Farquharson added: ""The difficulty is finding the staff now as we are just a seasonal employer so we start with 15 full-time staff and are now employing 60 to 70, which is a big ramp up from our small base.""

Cairngorm Mountain, near Aviemore, said it has had 23,000 skiers since opening on 21 November.
A spokesperson said: ""Since then, we have had 68 days of snowsports available, with some of our surface lifts - including the West Wall Poma - operating for the first time in several years.
""The team on the hill has been working around the clock to keep operations running smoothly and is focused on maximising the snowsports potential this season.""
They added: ""The winds and drifting snow have caused some challenges, but they have also created amazing conditions on the mountain.""
Nevis Range, near Fort William, and The Lecht, in Aberdeenshire, have also been able to open for snowsports.
A spokesperson for The Lecht, which opened on 8 January, said: ""This winter has been a lot more successful than last year.
""We have had lots of natural snow which has meant we have been able to open up the whole hill rather than just the beginners area with factory snow.""
Last year, The Lecht only managed to open its main uplift with natural snow for about five days and the rest was on artificially-made snow.
The spokesperson said: ""We were constantly battling mild temperatures last year.
""There is some mild weather coming in over the weekend so hopefully it won't do too much damage.""
While skiers have been enjoying the conditions, the heavy snow and strong winds have heightened the potential risk of avalanches on some of Scotland's highest mountains.
They include areas popular with hillwalkers, climbers and back country skiers.
The Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) provides hazard forecasts between mid-December to mid-April.
It has recorded about 150 avalanches already this season - almost 100 in the last month, and more than three times the number it did for the whole of the previous season.
There were 42 in 2024-25 - the lowest number in the service's almost 40-year history.
Earlier this week, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team said it came across an avalanche in Ben Nevis' Red Burn area during multiple rescues on the mountain.
SAIS has issued ""considerable"" avalanche hazard warnings in recent weeks, including for the Cairngorms, Creag Meagaidh and Lochaber.
The Met Office says year‑on‑year comparisons of snowfall are difficult because of the UK's highly variable climate.
It said a single winter may see more or less snow than the previous one for many different reasons.
""However, when we look at the longer‑term picture, over the last 30 years, there is a clear reduction in the number of days with falling snow,"" said a spokesperson.
They added: ""We'll need to wait until the end of this winter season before assessing how this year fits into that longer‑term trend.""
The Met Office said one thing that was certain was that this winter has been wet.
It reasons for this an ""energised"" jet stream, a fast-flowing current of air that travels around the planet, had seen low-pressure systems crossing the Atlantic towards the UK.
""Meanwhile, a blocking high pressure system over northern Europe has slowed or stalled these low-pressure systems allowing successive weather fronts to deposit rain on the UK,"" said the spokesperson.
""Persistent rainfall since the start of the year has created the sense that winter is 'stuck on repeat,' with little to no prolonged dry periods.""
They said western parts of Scotland in contrast have been much drier than normal.

"Don't make us security guards, says teacher stabbed by pupil",2026-02-20T06:13:33.577Z," Bethan Lewis
Wales family and education correspondent
","A teacher who thought she was going to die when she was stabbed by a 13-year-old pupil in the schoolyard has said giving staff handheld scanners will not stop violence in schools.
Liz Hopkin, who was attacked at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in 2024, said she ""felt really worried"" after the Welsh government announced it would offer school staff more guidance on what to do if they suspected a pupil had brought a weapon into school.
It comes as a 15-year-old boy was charged with attempted murder after a teacher was stabbed at a school in the neighbouring county.
Hopkin said teachers ""aren't security"", while the Welsh government said the resources were about ""prevention, building on existing guidance"".
Earlier this month, the Welsh government said it would be building on a protocol already in place in Cardiff where all schools had been issued with search wands.
But Hopkin said there was too much emphasis on ""detection"" rather than ""prevention"".
""By the time you've got the knife in school, you've missed so many opportunities prior to that - to stop the knife coming in in the first place,"" she said.
""I think it's a really good headline for the government to say they're bringing out this protocol because people will think that schools have got more powers then to deal with this, but actually you're just shifting the responsibility.""
She said it potentially added ""the role of security guard to teachers who are trying to build relationships with young people"".
""If pupils feel that you are now police and security, you're eroding any kind of trust that they would have in you.""
She added that asking a young person ""in crisis"" to go into a small room to be scanned could also escalate the situation.
""I just feel that that responsibility for searching for knives or weapons of any type should be left to the police.
""We already have enough responsibility with less and less resources.
""I would never, ever suggest to anybody to put themselves at risk to check. That's not your role.
""We aren't security. Stop putting the responsibility onto schools.""
The Welsh government said the work was ""part of a wide range of actions"" it was taking on behaviour following the National Behaviour Summit and after working with the education sector.
It added that the new resources would include training, strategies and information to a provide a consistent national approach to help keep all young people and school staff safe.
""These resources are not specifically about scanners and any decisions on having scanners would be taken at a local level. There is no expectation for staff to take on security-related duties.""
Hopkin, her colleague Fiona Elias and a pupil were attacked at the school where she worked in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, by a girl who had previously been found with a knife.
The teenager, who cannot be named due to her age, was sentenced to 15 years in detention last year, after she was found guilty of attempted murder.
A multi-agency review found the pupil would have benefited from ""targeted help"" if ""information had been fully shared and assessed"".
Hopkin, who has said she will never return to teaching, said: ""You kind of move a little bit forward, but it's not an experience that you get over.""
Most children carrying knives are doing so because of fear, with only a very few intent on hurting others, she said, adding that extreme incidents were born of more low-level disruption in classrooms, with exposure to social media content an aggravating factor.
""It's about earlier intervention. It's about putting much more money, funding and resources into early help.""
She said people tended to think of knife crime as ""something that happens in gangs and county lines"", but the incident that happened to her in Dyffran Aman shows it is happening ""in rural areas across Wales, where people feel that they will be safe from this type of incident"".
""It has to be stopped and it's not a case of stopping pupils coming in with weapons - yes that is part of it - but it's addressing the whole issue of what's going on in Welsh society in schools and in communities.""
Hopkin said budgetary pressures on schools and other services were ""a massive issue"".
""We're not getting the financial support within schools, within external agencies such as youth services, mental health services, all of those supportive services... all of that is being eroded.""
The Welsh government said it was working with a range of services to tackle the societal factors that influence behaviour in schools.
""We recently confirmed collaboration with the four Police and Crime Commissioners and their police forces to strengthen partnerships between police, local authorities, and schools,"" a spokesperson added.
Cardiff Council said its guidance was part of ""a broader framework of support to help schools in keeping all young people and school staff safe"".
It said searches were only carried out when there was ""a clear and reasonable concern that a young person may be in possession of a weapon"" and conducted ""with the utmost care and respect"".
Search wands were used to avoid physical contact, it said, adding ""they and the guidance do not replace law enforcement in an emergency"".
""This approach is trauma-informed, legally compliant and consistent across all Cardiff schools.""
Its guidance also covers preventative strategies including working with parents, carers and the community, as well as educating young people about the dangers of weapons, the spokesperson said.

Andrew released under investigation after arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office,2026-02-19T21:54:55.286Z," Zahra FatimaandHafsa Khalil
","Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been released under investigation following his arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
On Thursday morning, Thames Valley Police said it had arrested a man in his 60s in Norfolk and was carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk.
King Charles III said the ""law must take its course"" in response to Andrew's arrest and that the police had his ""full and wholehearted support and co-operation"".
Police had previously said they were considering investigating Andrew over allegations relating to his association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and were reviewing allegations he shared confidential material.
Communications between the pair featured among the tranche of files released by the US government.
In an updated statement on Thursday evening, Thames Valley Police confirmed the man ""had been released under investigation"". It added that its searches in Norfolk had now been concluded.
The former prince was pictured slumped back in the back seat of a vehicle after leaving Aylsham police station.
This is the first time Andrew has been arrested. He has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing.
Thames Valley Police said that, following a ""thorough assessment"", a formal investigation had now been opened.
It also said earlier in February that it was assessing a separate allegation that a second woman was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.
BBC News understands that Thames Valley Police contacted the Home Office to give them advance warning before Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested.
The arrest, which took place at Sandringham at 08:00 GMT on Thursday, is not in relation to any allegations of sexual offences.
Vehicles believed to be unmarked police cars were seen outside the King's Norfolk estate, where the former prince has been living since leaving his home in Windsor, in Berkshire.
The BBC understands that Royal Lodge - Andrew's former home in Windsor Great Park - is being searched by police. A number of uniformed officers have been seen beyond the gates.
Thames Valley Police said it was not naming the arrested man ""as per national guidance"", and warned that as the case was now active, care must be taken to avoid being in contempt of court.
Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: ""We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.""
Norfolk Constabulary told the BBC it was ""supporting a Thames Valley Police investigation into misconduct in a public office"".
The former Duke of York served as the UK's trade envoy between 2001 and 2011, travelling globally and enjoying privileged access to senior government and business contacts around the world.
In 2010, Andrew appears to have forwarded government reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore and China to Epstein, files relating to the late financier recently released by the US Department of Justice appear to show.
The documents also appear to show Andrew forwarded information on investment opportunities in gold and uranium in Afghanistan to Epstein.
Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.
King Charles said he learned of the news his brother's arrest with the ""deepest concern"".
""What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,"" he said in a statement.
""Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.
""As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.""
The BBC understands that the Prince and Princess of Wales support the King's statement.
It is also understood that neither the King nor Buckingham Palace were given advance warning of Andrew's arrest, which occurred on his 66th birthday.
The royals have been maintaining a business as usual approach, opting to continue with their engagements, despite the extraordinary developments of this morning.
The King, who had been attending a solo engagement to mark the start of London Fashion Week on Thursday, did not react to questions from reporters asking for his reaction to his brother's arrest.
Queen Camilla was asked about the arrest of her brother-in-law as she left an engagement in Windsor on Thursday.
""Are you concerned about Andrew's arrest, your Majesty?"" the Queen was asked as she got into a waiting car outside a lunchtime orchestral concert at Sinfonia Smith Square Hall. She was seen waving but did not respond.
Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing over his association with Epstein. He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on the specific allegations in relation to the release of millions of Epstein files in January.
Meanwhile, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told the BBC that he has submitted a five-page letter to several UK police forces providing new and additional information from the Epstein files.
In a statement, Brown says the new information is in addition to what he submitted to the forces last week, in which he ""expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women"".
The brother of the late Virginia Giuffre, Sky Roberts has told BBC Newsnight that he believes his sister had been ""vindicated"" by news of Andrew's arrest.
The former prince previously faced allegations from Virginia Giuffre, which were settled out of court.
She alleged she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions, including on Epstein's private island Little St James in the early 2000s.
The settlement reached between the two made no admission of wrongdoing on Andrew's part.
Despite acknowledging the reasoning behind Andrew's arrest as ""not a direct correlation"" to Virginia's allegations, Roberts heralded the moment as a ""win for survivors"".
""We wouldn't be here without her (Virginia). We wouldn't be to a moment [sic] where this would have been investigated to this point"" he said.
Roberts also commended the King for his support of the investigation by Thames Valley Police, adding: ""I say thank you to the King and to the Royal Family for standing behind survivors"".
Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 as he said the allegations had become a ""disruption"" for the royal family.
He subsequently lost his military titles and royal patronages as Giuffre brought a civil action against him in the US in 2022.
However, he has kept his place as eighth in line to the throne.
Andrew was stripped of his princely title in October 2025, the same month Giuffre's posthumous memoir was published and as fresh details about his association with Epstein came to light.
US President Donald Trump reacting to the arrest told reporters: ""I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the Royal family.""

What happens next after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest?,2026-02-19T21:50:43.433Z," Duncan WalkerandTom McArthur
","Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
It comes after Thames Valley Police said it was assessing a complaint over the alleged sharing of confidential material by the former prince with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The former prince has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.
He has since been released under investigation. Andrew was seen leaving Aylsham police station on Thursday evening.
Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at about 08:00 GMT on Thursday on the King's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, where he has been staying.
Officers arrested the King's brother on his 66th birthday.
It is understood that neither the King nor Buckingham Palace was informed in advance of Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest, by officers from Thames Valley Police.
We don't know the specifics of the allegations of misconduct in public office being investigated.
However, previously reported allegations include that he had shared reports from trade visits, forwarded a confidential briefing on investment in Afghanistan, and passed a Treasury briefing to a personal business contact.
BBC News UK and home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said: ""There has to be an assumption that part of this is going to be the sharing of documents within the Epstein files - between Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein himself. That's when Thames Valley Police got involved.""
But Sandford said it was possible that police were not only focusing on emails seen widely in the Epstein files.
""Firstly, there's three million documents in the files, so there may be some the media have missed. But secondly, Buckingham Palace said they would support Thames Valley Police in their inquiries.
""And that potentially means the police have gone to the Palace, or could go to the Palace, asking to see evidence of communications between Andrew and others.""
Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright of Thames Valley Police said: ""We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.""
The force said it would not be naming the arrested man ""as per national guidance"".
In a later update on Thursday evening, Thames Valley Police confirmed the arrested man ""has now been released under investigation"".
It is the first time the former prince, who has faced numerous allegations over his links to Epstein, has been arrested.
Misconduct in public office is a really complicated offence, writes BBC News home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani.
It essentially boils down to an allegation that someone who was doing a job on behalf of the British public did something seriously wrong, knowing it to be wrong.
There are four ""elements"" or factors that police must focus on during their investigation so that prosecutors can later decide whether or not someone should be charged.
First, the police must establish whether the person they're investigating was a ""public officer"" and the incident in question was plausibly part of those duties.
If that's agreed, detectives will then look for evidence that the incident in question saw the suspect ""wilfully"" neglecting to perform their duty or wilfully misconducting themselves in some other way. That wordy definition has long been a source of legal debate.
The next question is whether the action they committed was so bad that it was ""an abuse of the public's trust"".
Lastly, if the evidence has passed those three tests, police need to examine whether the person under investigation acted ""without reasonable excuse or justification"".
That final question is crucial. It's a fundamental principle of criminal justice that someone suspected of wrongdoing is given an opportunity to put forward their side of the story - and that starts when the police come and knock on their door.
King Charles's brother spent much of his 66th birthday in custody and we've just received word on where he had been taken.
The former prince was pictured slumped back in a vehicle following his release from Aylsham police station on Thursday evening.
Typically with arrests relating to white collar crime, people are held for a few hours to allow for searches and initial questioning. Being released under investigation does not rule out further questioning at a later date.
At some point a decision will have to be made by the Crown Prosecution Service and Thames Valley Police about whether to charge the King's brother with misconduct in a public office.
It could be weeks before any substantial decision is made.
On Thursday morning, Thames Valley Police said that, in addition to the arrest, it was ""carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk"".
Unmarked police vehicles were seen arriving at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk before Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest.
In an updated statement following Andrew's release, Thames Valley Police said its searches in Norfolk ""have now concluded"".
In recent weeks, Andrew has set up a temporary home on the estate whilst his permanent residence there, Marsh Farm, is being renovated.
Meanwhile, BBC News correspondent Helena Wilkinson, said she had seen uniformed police officers close to the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park.
Until very recently, this sprawling property in Berkshire is where Andrew lived.
BBC News understands that searches are being carried out at Royal Lodge and that the officers are there to guard the scene. It is thought to be the only address being searched at the moment in Berkshire.
Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent, told BBC News that by arresting the King's brother, officers will be able to ""to access computer equipment, files, photographs, any other evidence"".
He said they will be able to ""carry out searches of any premises he owns or occupies, or any other premises he controls, so there may well be searches in other areas as well"".
The King has said ""the law must take its course"", following the arrest of his brother.
In a statement the King said: ""I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office.
""What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.
""In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation.
""Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.
""As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter.
""Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all. Charles R.""

How do islands compare on price of food essentials?,2026-02-19T17:24:13.715Z," Euan Duncan
Guernsey
","A consumer council has questioned why Jersey shoppers are paying more for food than those in Guernsey.
It comes after a minister said last week it was ""really unfortunate"" if having separate ferry operators between the islands increased food prices.
BBC analysis of 12 everyday items suggested prices in Jersey were on average 6.2% higher than those in Guernsey - exceeding the 5% goods and services tax (GST) in place in Jersey but not Guernsey.
Jersey Consumer Council chairman Carl Walker said: ""People can understand why prices are going to be more expensive in Jersey than the UK, but when you start looking at Guernsey with it being so close... you have to start asking 'what's going on?'.""
The BBC tracked the price of the same 12 items of food over the past week at four island supermarkets, revealing a disparity in the cost of produce including easy peelers, chopped tomatoes and beef mince.
In addition to the GST, the minimum wage in Jersey is 40p an hour higher than in Guernsey.
However, Walker said having two ferry operators was also driving up prices.
Lifeline freight services to Guernsey and Jersey are provided by different companies after a joint tender process by the island's governments failed to result in a unanimous decision.
Walker said: ""We've got two different ferry operators charging potentially different prices.
""We saw one of the big retailers recently go public about the difference in freight and the red tape and the struggles that they have in operating in the island.
""What both islands lack is some sort of discounted supermarket like an Aldi or a Lidl. That would help drive prices right down.""
Sustainable Economic Development Minister Kirsten Morel, who led the negotiations for the ferry deal, said it was unfortunate if choosing separate operators led to higher prices on food but added he would not apologise for ""protecting Jersey's food supply chain"".
Sandpiper CI, which manages the M&S franchise in Jersey, in December 2025 wrote to the island's scrutiny panel requesting a review of the contract signed between DFDS and the Government of Jersey.
Mark Cox, chief executive of the Channel Islands Coop, previously said dealing with the two different ferry contracts was ""challenging"" and added to the ""complexity of a very expensive supply chain"".
Waitrose said its prices were ""fairly based on additional costs"" while Morrisons said prices differed in the islands from the UK ""due to the additional costs such as logistics"".
CI Coop, a separate business to the Co-op Group in the UK, said: ""Our location means higher shipping and freight costs, and getting goods on to island shelves is simply more expensive.
""Over the past three years, inflation in the islands has been higher than in the UK, and local wage levels already exceed the UK National Living Wage.
""These factors all contribute to the cost of operating here and, inevitably, influence the prices customers see.
""We also apply the same pricing across Jersey and Guernsey, with differences only where required by local taxes.
""This means any variation is limited to GST and products subject to different duty rates, such as tobacco, beers, wines, and spirits.""
In 2024, Morrisons began running supermarket franchises in the islands and began expanding later that year.
It said: ""Since acquiring our stores in the Channel Islands we have been working hard on reviewing our customer offerings.
""Since November, we have reduced over 890 prices and currently offer the cheapest prices for a wide range of basket staples such as bread, milk, tea, eggs and butter.""
The BBC contacted Sandpaper CI but the company declined to comment.

'Just to be nominated for an Oscar is incredible',2026-02-19T16:34:20.349Z," Pamela Tickell
North East and Cumbria
","A visual effects supervisor said just to be nominated for an Oscar, regardless of a win, was ""quite incredible"".
Teesside University creative digital media graduate Russell Bowen was one of a team of four to receive a Best Visual Effects Academy Award nomination for The Lost Bus, based on a rescue mission during the 2018 Californian wildfires.
Bowen, from Pembrokeshire but now based in Vancouver, said: ""Amazingly, we're up against some of the very people who inspired me to go into the industry.""
He said he was inspired by staff and guest speakers at the university to follow a career in visual effects, and that he would attend the awards in Hollywood on 15 March.
He shares the nomination with Charlie Noble, David Zaretti and Brandon McLaughlin for the survival drama which follows a bus driver who helps 22 children to safety from the inferno.
Bowen studied BA (Hons) Creative Digital Media and graduated in 2009.
""When guest speakers used to come up to do talks for students about their work in film, I knew I'd found my career and Teesside was going to help me get there.""
He said hundreds of artists ""poured their hearts and souls"" into creating the visual effects in the film.
""I'm proud to represent them at the most prestigious film awards night on the calendar,"" Bowen said.
""When I heard we'd been nominated, I went through the motions of shock which turned into overwhelming joy.""
Bowen spent 14 years with visual effects company DNEG working on films such as Venom; The Fate of the Furious and Star Trek Beyond.
More recently he joined beloFX, working on projects including Star Wars: The Acolyte, and is currently working on horror film The Mummy with Blumhouse and Warner Brothers.

Deputies from islands discuss sea and air links,2026-02-19T12:28:46.947Z," Zhara Simpson
Channel Islands
","A ""productive"" series of meetings have focused on sea and air links in the Channel Islands, deputies have said.
President of the States of Guernsey's Committee for Economic Development, Deputy Sasha Kazantseva-Miller, and Vice President, Deputy Andrew Niles, invited Jersey Deputy Kirsten Morel, Minister for Sustainable Economic Development, to the island on 13 February.
The States of Guernsey said the discussions focused on how the two islands could work together to achieve the best outcomes for islanders in both communities.
Kazantseva-Miller said the size of the islands and the diversity of operators and community needs meant it was a ""complex landscape"" to navigate.
She said: ""I would like to thank Deputy Morel for travelling to Guernsey for a reciprocal meeting to continue discussions around ways we can improve inter-island connectivity, trade and relations between the two Bailiwicks.
""Connectivity is central to our economic prosperity as well as social, sporting, and cultural interactions.""
Morel said: ""We began discussing areas of mutual interest when Deputy Kazantseva-Miller visited Jersey a few weeks ago, and today was productive in developing those discussions with the objective of benefiting islanders and businesses in both Bailiwicks.
""I am grateful to Deputy Kazantseva-Miller for hosting such a productive series of meetings.""
Kazantseva-Miller said since the the 2025 election, its priority was to engage with Jersey in a ""pragmatic and solutions-driven manner"" which was the focus of their meetings.

Earlier, Thames Valley Police released a separate statement saying it had arrested a man in his 60s.
It comes after police said they were assessing a complaint over the alleged sharing of confidential material with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Royal Family tree: King Charles III's closest family and line of succession,2026-02-19T12:09:11.230Z,No Author Listed,"King Charles III became the UK's monarch on 8 September 2022, making him the oldest person to succeed to the British throne, at the age of 73.
The order of succession is the members of the Royal Family in the order in which they stand in line to the throne.
Born: 1948
Charles has been King since his mother Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022.
The now former Prince of Wales married Lady Diana Spencer, who became the Princess of Wales, on 29 July 1981. The couple had two sons, William and Harry. They later separated and their marriage was dissolved in 1996. On 31 August 1997, the princess was killed in a car crash in Paris.
He married Camilla Parker Bowles on 9 April 2005. When Charles became King, she became Queen Consort, as per the wishes of the late queen. Following the coronation she is now known as Queen Camilla.

Complete guide to King Charles III's Coronation
Born: 1982
Prince William is the elder son of King Charles III and Diana, Princess of Wales, and is now first in line to the throne.
He was 15 when his mother died. He went on to study at the University of St Andrews, where he met his future wife, Kate Middleton. The couple were married in 2011.
On his 21st birthday he was appointed a Counsellor of State - standing in for the late queen on official occasions. He and his wife had their first child, George, in July 2013, their second, Charlotte, in 2015 and third, Louis, in 2018.
The prince trained with the Army, Royal Navy and RAF before spending three years as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot with RAF Valley on Anglesey, north Wales. He also worked part-time for two years as a co-pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance alongside his royal duties. He left the role in July 2017 to take on more royal duties on behalf of his grandparents.
William inherited the Duchy of Cornwall estate from his father and is now the Prince of Wales. Catherine is now the Princess of Wales.
As heir to the throne, his main duties are to support the King in his royal commitments.
Born: 2013
George Alexander Louis was born on 22 July 2013 at St Mary's Hospital in London. His father was present for the birth of his son, who weighed 8lb 6oz (3.8kg).
Prince George of Wales, as he is formally known, is second in line to the throne, after his father.
Born: 2015
Catherine, Princess of Wales gave birth to her second child, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, on 2 May 2015, at St Mary's Hospital. William was present for the birth of the 8lb 3oz (3.7kg) baby.
She is third in line to the throne, after her father and older brother, and is known as Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Wales.
Born: 2018
The new Princess of Wales gave birth to her third child, a boy weighing 8lbs 7oz, on 23 April 2018, at St Mary's Hospital in London.
William was present for the birth of Louis Arthur Charles, who is fourth in line to the throne.
Born: 1984
Prince Harry trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and went on to become a lieutenant in the Army, serving as a helicopter pilot.
During his 10 years in the armed forces, Capt Wales, as he became known, saw active service in Afghanistan twice, in 2012 to 2013 as an Apache helicopter co-pilot and gunner. He left the Army in 2015 and now focuses on charitable work, including conservation in Africa and organising the Invictus Games for injured members of the armed forces.
He has been a Counsellor of State since his 21st birthday and stood in for the late queen on official duties.
He married US actress Meghan Markle on 19 May 2018, at Windsor Castle. In January 2020, the royal couple said they would step back as ""senior"" royals and divide their time between the UK and North America. They said they intended to ""work to become financially independent"".
Just over a year later, Buckingham Palace confirmed the couple would not be returning to royal duties, and would give up their honorary military appointments and royal patronages.
Born: 2019
The Sussexes' first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on 6 May 2019, weighing 7lbs 3oz, with the duke present for his birth.
Archie was not automatically a prince when he was born because he was not a grandson of the monarch. But he gained the right to that title when King Charles acceded to the throne. Harry and Meghan are understood to want their children to decide for themselves whether or not to use their titles when they are older.
Born: 2021
The Duchess of Sussex gave birth to her second child in Santa Barbara, California, on 4 June 2021. Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor - to be known as Lili - is named after the Royal Family's nickname for the late queen.
She was given the middle name Diana in honour of Prince Harry's mother, who died in a car crash in 1997 when he was 12 years old. Like her brother, she gained the right to use the royal title when her grandfather became king.
Born: 1960
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was the third child of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - but the first to be born to a reigning monarch for 103 years.
He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They had two daughters - Beatrice, in 1988, and Eugenie, in 1990. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996.
Andrew served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. In addition to royal engagements, he served as a special trade representative for the government until 2011.
Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after an interview with the BBC about his relationship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges.
In February 2022, Andrew agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle a civil sexual assault case brought against him in the US by one of Epstein's victims, although he made no admission of liability and had repeatedly denied the allegations.
The scandal continued to dog Andrew and in October 2025 he gave up his titles, including the Duke of York, and days later was also stripped of his prince title.
He was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office in February 2026. It came after police said they were assessing a complaint over the alleged sharing of confidential material by the former prince with Epstein. Andrew has denied wrongdoing in relation to the Epstein files.
He remains eighth in line to the throne.
Born: 1988
Princess Beatrice is the elder daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice.
She married property tycoon Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi at The Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor, in July 2020. The couple had been due to marry in May, but coronavirus delayed the plans.
Born: 2021
Princess Beatrice had a baby girl, Sienna Elizabeth, in September 2021, who is 10th in line to the throne. Princess Beatrice is also stepmother to Mr Mapelli Mozzi's son Christopher Woolf, known as Wolfie, from his previous relationship with Dara Huang.
Born: 2025
The couple welcomed their second daughter, Athena Elizabeth Rose, on 22 January 2025. She was born several weeks prematurely weighing 4lbs 5oz. She is 11th in line to the throne.
Born: 1990
Princess Eugenie is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Her full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie and she is 12th in line to the throne.
Like her sister Princess Beatrice, she has no official surname, but uses York. She married her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on 12 October 2018.
Born: 2021
Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's son, August, born on 9 February 2021.
Born: 2023
Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's second son was born on 30 May 2023 making him 14th in line to the throne.
Born: 1964
Prince Edward was given the title Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, almost two years after the death of his father Prince Philip, who previously held the title. It was understood that Philip had wanted Edward to take on the title, but the decision was left to King Charles.
Prince Edward's wife Sophie becomes the Duchess of Edinburgh and the prince's former title, the Earl of Wessex, has now been given to his son James, Viscount Severn. The couple also have a daughter, Lady Louise, born in 2003.
After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company. He subsequently supported the late queen in her official duties and carried out public engagements for charities. He is 15th in line to the throne.
Born: 2007
James, Earl of Wessex is the younger child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. He was given the title after his father Prince Edward became the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2023.
When James was born, he was given the title Viscount Severn - a ""courtesy"" title as son of an earl, rather than using prince. It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles.
Born: 2003
Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter.
Born: 1950
Anne, Princess Royal is Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's second child and only daughter. When she was born she was third in line to the throne, but is now 18th. She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987.
Princess Anne has married twice; her first husband Captain Mark Phillips is the father of her two children, Peter and Zara, while her second is Vice-Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence.
The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970.
Born: 1977
Peter Phillips is the eldest of the late queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012.
The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles.
Peter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020.
Born: 2010
Savannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly and was the late queen's first great-grandchild.
Born: 2012
Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly.
Born: 1981
Zara Tindall followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple had their first child, Mia Grace, in 2014.
The children of the Princess Royal do not hold a royal title, as they are descended from the female line, but she remains 22nd in line to the throne. Their father, Mark Phillips, turned down an earldom when he married Princess Anne, so they do not have courtesy titles.
Born: 2014
Zara Tindall gave birth to her first child, Mia Grace, in January 2014.
Born: 2018
The couple's second child was born on 18 June 2018 at Stroud Maternity Unit, Gloucestershire, weighing 9lb 3oz.
Lena Elizabeth was named in honour of her great-grandmother.
Like her sister, Lena does not have a royal title and so will also be known as Miss Tindall.
Born: 2021
Zara and Mike Tindall's son Lucas Philip, their third child was born on 21 March 2021 weighing 8lbs 4oz. He is 25th in line to the throne.

"Do not give away Diego Garcia, Trump tells UK in fresh attack on Chagos deal",2026-02-19T09:03:42.640Z," Jaroslav Lukiv
","Donald Trump has thrown the UK's Chagos deal into doubt as he launched a stinging criticism of the plan that would see the UK hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a joint UK-US military base.
The US president urged Sir Keir Starmer not to ""give away Diego Garcia"" - the largest island on the archipelago and home to the base.
Trump said ""this land should not be taken away from the UK"" and if it did it would be ""a blight on our Great Ally"", in a post on social media.
This comes despite Washington on Tuesday giving its official backing to London's plan to cede sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius.
In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was ""crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe"".
""The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,"" it said in a statement.
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.
Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.
Under the deal - which was announced last May - the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years at an average cost of £101m a year.
Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.
The US president's position on the issue has seen rapid U-turns in recent months - from describing the planned transfer as an ""act of great stupidity"" to saying the deal was the ""best"" the prime minister could make.
UK ministers have previously said that the deal could not go ahead unless it had the support of the US.
The bill, aimed at enshrining the agreement into UK law, has been delayed and there is no date set for the next stage.
UK Minister Alex Davies-Jones said the bill would return to the House of Lords ""as soon as parliamentary time allows"".
Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: ""I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...""
The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was ""strategically located in the Indian Ocean"".
""Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,"" he said.
""We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.""
And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: ""Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the airfield located in Fairford in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.""
The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities.
The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.
Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: ""The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.
""When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies.""
But on Tuesday, the US Department of State gave its official backing to the planned handover of the Chagos Islands.
In a statement, it said it ""supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago"".
Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: ""It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether.""
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail.""
Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: ""Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history.""
Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.
They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Misley Mandarin - one of the Chagossians who had travelled to the islands - said they would have to ""drag me from my beach"".
He said ""there's no reason"" for the deal ""because Mauritius never owned Chagos Islands in the first place"".
""Keir Starmer, you could be a hero right now - don't ratify that deal, cancel that deal and let Chagossians come back to their homeland as British,"" he added.
The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.
The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.
But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.
In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.
Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.

Veterans threaten MoD with legal action over LGBT compensation scheme,2026-02-19T02:51:07.592Z," Josh Parry
LGBT & identity reporter
","A pair of veterans who say they were driven out of the armed forces for being gay have threatened to take legal action against the Ministry of Defence after being refused access to financial reparations.
The former servicemen say that, because of their rank, they have been unfairly denied access to the government's full compensation scheme - which offers up to £70,000 to those who lost their careers under a ban that lasted until 2000.
It comes just months after King Charles III dedicated the UK's first memorial to those impacted by the so-called ""gay ban"".
The BBC has contacted the MoD, which previously said it ""deeply regrets"" the treatment of those impacted by the ban.
Mark Shephard, 49 and Steven Stewart, 55, have issued a pre-action letter to the MoD, challenging the lawfulness of the LGBT+ Veterans Financial Recognition scheme, which was introduced after a landmark report into the treatment of LGBT+ veterans under the ban.
The law - which was in place between 1967-2000 - meant personnel who were gay, or perceived to be gay, faced intrusive investigations, the shame of dishonourable discharge and in some cases imprisonment.
Those impacted can apply for a LGBT Dismissed or Discharged Payment of £50,000, with an additional amount of up to £20,000 available for those who experienced additional impacts, such as criminal records or abusive questioning and interrogation.
The pair are part of a group of around 40 veterans who have been rejected for the payment, and say the scheme's criteria unfairly discriminates against lower-ranking veterans who felt forced out of the military.
Under the terms of the scheme, those who were commissioned officers - a position of authority in the forces - who were not dismissed outright but felt pressured or forced to leave because of the threat of disciplinary action qualify to receive the £50,000 payment.
However non-commissioned ranks who felt similarly forced out do not qualify for the payment.
Lawyers for the pair say this distinction means the scheme ""does not operate fairly between individuals who were differently ranked during service"" and say they are prepared to bring a judicial review to force the government to widen the criteria.
They predict the rules could be stopping thousands of veterans from receiving reparations.
Shephard served in the RAF from 1995 to 2001 as a fitter, helping to maintain and service aircraft.
He says in 1999, while serving at RAF Benson, he was questioned about his sexuality and told he could either face dismissal, or volunteer to resign and work his 18-month notice period.
He said: ""I felt like I was driven out of the career I trained hard to achieve and excelled at.""
Shephard added: ""Nothing will ever make up for what many people had to go through. This action isn't about the money but ensuring those who had to give up their military lives and careers get the justice they're entitled to.""
The threat of legal action is likely to cause embarrassment for the MoD, which has been keen to publicise the work its done to make reparations for the suffering caused by the ban, including hosting an official event in which the King dedicated a memorial to LGBT+ service personnel.
Angela Jackman KC, a partner at Irwin Mitchell, representing the veterans, said: ""The scheme makes no allowance for Dismissed or Discharged Payment to potentially thousands of enlisted personnel who say they were subjected to discrimination and harassment, including disciplinary proceedings, which forced them to resign.
""In some cases, veterans say they were given an ultimatum to resign otherwise face consequences such as dishonourable discharge.
""The rules simply do not acknowledge numerous circumstances where veterans were constructively dismissed.""
Stewart served for seven years in the British Army as a corporal in the Royal Military Police, where he was deployed in the Gulf War and in Northern Ireland, receiving a Accumulated Campaign Service Medal for his long-term service.
He left the army in 1995 following an investigation into his sexuality, which he says was ""intrusive and deeply traumatic"".
He added: ""The least I and many others deserve is for the redress scheme to actually recognise what happened to hundreds, if not thousands of service personnel, was wrong.""
The MoD has previously vowed to speed up the awards process after it was criticised for handling applications too slowly, particularly for elderly and infirm veterans.
BBC News understands that a number of former service personnel who were eligible for the scheme have died while waiting for payouts.
Ed Hall, chairman of LGBT+ veterans support charity Fighting with Pride, said: ""This scheme is an opportunity for the government to put itself on the right side of history, and we urge the government to listen and address the manifest injustice these former service people are facing.""
A spokesperson for the MoD previously said it ""deeply regrets the treatment of LGBT serving personnel between 1967 and 2000, which was wholly unacceptable"" and that what they experienced was ""not reflective of today's values or the inclusive culture of our armed forces"".
The BBC has contacted the MoD for its response to the threat of legal action.

'Heavy and persistent' rain causes flooding,2026-02-18T18:40:53.578Z," George Thorpe
Channel Islands
","People have been warned localised flooding is an ""ongoing risk"" as heavy rain batters the Channel Islands.
Jersey's government said 20 to 30mm (0.8 to 1.2 inches) of rain was expected throughout the day and floods had been reported in several areas of the island.
Traffic and Highways Services in Guernsey said flooding had also impacted roads with an emergency closures on La Route des Capelles, Route des Coutanchez and Verte Rue in St Sampson.
Jersey Met's forecast said further rainfall on Wednesday could be ""heavy and persistent"" across the Channel Islands with another 10mm (0.4 inches) possible overnight.
Jersey's Infrastructure & Environment (I&E) department advised people to travel with caution due to flooding and standing water on the roads.
""Teams from I&E are working to clear debris and make the roads safe,"" it added.
The department also advised people to check for blocked drains at their properties.
In Guernsey, the government said the road closure in St Sampson would be in place ""until further notice"".
""La Route des Capelles, Verte Rue and Route des Coutanchez in St Sampson has been closed between Grow Limited and The Guernsey Institute Coutanchez Campus due to flooding following heavy rain,"" a Facebook post added.
Jersey Police said it had received reports a section of Trinity Hill near Oak Tree Gardens had lifted due to the adverse weather conditions.
A police spokesperson said: ""The Parish of St Helier has been notified and will be attending to assess.
""Please take care whilst travelling along this section of road.""
Mist and fog has also been causing disruption on the island, with Jersey Airport saying some flights might be delayed.
A post on its Facebook page said: ""With high passenger volumes expected, the terminal may be busier than usual.
""Please check directly with your airline for the latest flight updates.""

Thousands of puffins starve to death during storms,2026-02-18T18:03:04.463Z," Lisa Young
CornwallandTamsin Melville
Cornwall
","Thousands of dead seabirds have washed up on the south west coast, Channel Islands and French beaches, a wildlife trust has said.
The majority of the birds are puffins which had become starved and exhausted due to not being able to feed during the recent storms.
Alderney Wildlife Trust (AWT) said it had received reports of puffins stranded on the island's beaches and more than 10,000 of the birds had perished and washed up on beaches in France, Spain and Portugal.
Cornwall Wildlife Trust (CWT) said 262 puffins had washed up on Cornish beaches in January and February while only two had been reported last year.
The south west coast has been battered by storms since January with Goretti, Ingrid and Chandra all causing floods and devastation for both humans and wildlife.
Roland Gauvain, the chief executive of AWT, said the Channel Islands had ""so far been reasonably lucky"".
He said there had been a major seabird wreck (the term for a mass-mortality event) in 2014 when 54,000 birds were recorded washed up, of which about 30,000 to 36,000 were puffins.
He added colleagues in France had also collected data for Spain and Portugal and found thousands of dead seabirds had been recorded.
""It seems the wreck has reached over 10,000 at this point, though there is a lot of proving figures to be done. That's probably an underestimate of what has been found so we're looking at a major seabird wreck,"" he said.
Puffins rely on their eyesight to hunt and need clear water to find food but rough seas had made it difficult for them to feed, Gauvain explained.

""Those populations will most likely be UK and northern European breeding populations that have been wintering out at sea and have been picked up in the storms during the last couple of months and bashed around the place,"" he added.
""Finally they are making their way back on shore where, unfortunately, a lot of them are already dead or dying as they approach the coastlines and get into rougher coastal waters.
""The south, southerly and southwesterly winds seem to have kept this event more along the French coastlines.
""If the wind comes more to the west, I think we're likely to see increasing numbers in our region.""
Bex Allen who runs Cornwall Wildlife Trust's (CWT) Marine Strandings Network said it had received more than 40 calls a day about seabird deaths.
She said the trust was waiting for post-mortem results but believed it was the continuous bad weather that had affected wildlife including seabirds.
""They're beautiful and to see them washing up especially in these numbers is really heartbreaking,"" she said. ""It hasn't shown any let up at the moment I'm afraid.
""It's like it's progressed around the coast so I'm expecting them to come in a bit further north, maybe working up into north Devon over the next few days. We just have to see really.""
She said the following number of stranded seabirds had been reported to the trust during January and February:
262 puffins
21 guillemot
5 cormorant
4 razorbill
3 Manx shearwater
2 gulls
2 kittewake
1 black backed gull
1 great Northern diver
1 little auk
1 shag
During 2025 two puffins were reported during the year and 14 were recorded in 2024.
Cadi Penny at Rosemullion Veterinary Practice in Falmouth has cared for two puffins which were stranded at nearby beaches. She said the birds were fed with fish paste by syringe.
""Once we had two days of getting them both well fed we could then pass them on to an appropriate rehab person to help us out.
""They're doing brilliantly, they're putting on weight every day and doing really well, so hopefully will be released soon.""
CWT advised anyone finding a dead puffin to call its Marine Strandings Network on 0345 201 2626 so the data could be sent to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
The charity said anyone who found a live exhausted seabird should contact a local vet or the RSPCA West Hatch Wildlife Centre on 0300 123 0721.
Penny advised people who found unwell birds to approach them wearing personal protective equipment because of bird flu and also as wild birds ""could be quite feisty"".
She said: ""Pick them up gently with a towel and cover their head, even when they're feeling quite poorly they are very feisty creatures, so cover their head as it helps calm them.""
AWT urged people finding sick or dead birds in the Channel Islands to contact local shelters.
Advice has also been issued on Facebook by Jersey's government, which said anyone who finds a dead seabird should contact the environment department with the location of the animal.
""We're monitoring the situation closely with colleagues in Guernsey, France and the UK,"" the Facebook post added.

Met making 'initial inquiries' into claims about Andrew protection officers,2026-02-18T14:36:24.611Z," Kathryn ArmstrongandGuy Lambert
","The Metropolitan Police is carrying out ""initial inquiries"" into allegations relating to close protection officers formerly assigned to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
It comes after an unnamed former senior Met protection officer told LBC that members of the Royalty and Specialist Protection (RaSP) may have ""wilfully turned a blind eye"" during visits to a private island owned by Jeffery Epstein.
Multiple survivors have alleged they were trafficked to and abused on the island, known as Little St James, which Epstein purchased in 1998.
In a statement, the Met said it had ""not identified any wrongdoing"" but ""initial enquiries into these specific allegations have begun so we can establish the facts"".
Speaking to LBC on Tuesday, the former Met protection officer claimed Andrew's protection team travelled with him to the private island on at least two occasions, including travelling on Epstein's private jet on one of those occasions.
The unnamed former officer said there were ""real concerns"" in the late 1990s and early 2000s that the ""royal protection team became too close to their principals"", and staff were ""terrified"" of being demoted.
Under the rules governing how police forces are held to account, the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) would carry out any further investigation should the initial Met assessment identify concerns.
Andrew's accuser Virginia Giuffre alleged she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions, including on Little St James in the early 2000s.
While Andrew reached a financial settlement with Giuffre, it did not constitute an admission of wrongdoing, and the former prince has always strenuously denied any offence.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell on 10 August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.
Multiple police forces across the UK have said they are assessing whether to launch investigations into Epstein-related allegations. They are:
Thames Valley Police - assessing allegations that a second woman was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with the former prince
Essex Police - examining flight logs and emails referencing Epstein's private jet using Stansted Airport
Bedfordshire Police - assessing Epstein's use of London Luton Airport
Met Police - launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson, following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein
Surrey Police - seeking information on an allegation of human trafficking and sexual assault dating back to the mid-1990s
Norfolk Constabulary - reviewing Epstein files but have not received specific allegations
Wiltshire Police - reviewing its records and ""cannot definitively say that we have not had any allegations at this stage"", and said it had supported the Met
Police Scotland - said it wanted to ""speak to anyone with information"" about Epstein's private jet using Edinburgh Airport
West Midlands Police - confirmed it was assessing the private flights into and out of Birmingham Airport following the publication of Epstein files
The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has set up a national coordination group that is working with the National Crime Agency to support the number of forces carrying out enquiries.
A NPCC spokesperson said this will help forces ""understand any potential impact arising from the millions of documents that have been made"", adding ""it may take some time due to the volume of material and the complexity of international jurisdictions"".
""The sharing of documents related to oversees criminal investigations between law enforcement agencies in different countries is an extremely complex process, and not straight forward.""
Additional reporting by Chi Chi Izundu
Clarification 18 February: The story initially reported the Metropolitan Police is carrying out ""initial inquiries"" into close protection officers formerly assigned to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. The story has been amended to make clear the force is carrying out ""initial inquiries"" into allegations relating to close protection officers formerly assigned to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

Ramadan a time to 'super-fast charge yourself',2026-02-18T14:22:53.699Z,No Author Listed,"Ramadan is a time to ""super-fast charge yourself spiritually and mentally"" for the year ahead, a Muslim representative has said.
Muslims across the Channel Islands are observing the holy month by not eating or drinking during daylight hours.
The period of fasting is broken by a meal after sunset, called Iftar, which Jersey Islamic Centre trustee Dr Sarfaraz Jamali said provided a ""sense of belonging"" for many.
Imraan Moolla, from the Guernsey Muslim Initiative (GMI), said: ""Ramadan comes around once a year, and in that month you super-fast charge yourself spiritually and mentally - hopefully it will last you to the next Ramadan.""
Jamali said he had seen the Muslim community in Jersey grow significantly since he helped found the Islamic Centre.
""We are running into shortage of a space how to squeeze it into,"" he said.
""Every year the community is growing.
""It is just that sense of belonging and we are part of the community, plus you have those who are helping and I take my hat off to them.""
The Islamic Centre estimates between 65 to 70 people come together each evening for Iftar.
Moolla, from the Guernsey Muslim Initiative (GMI), said Ramadan was a personal journey to spiritually reset and refocus values.
He said the island's Muslim community was ""quite small and spread out"" which was why there were planned events, organised by both the GMI and the Guernsey Islamic Charitable Trust (GICT), for the community at the mosque as well as outside.
""Many people live far from their families in their home countries, so Ramadan can feel far away from family,"" he said.
""These community initiatives help bring people together.""
He likened the holy ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar to ""fast charging yourself"".
""It teaches patience as well,"" he said.
""People may be tired or a bit hangry, but the whole point is to just stay calm and keep yourself in check.""

Pet firm ends trips to islands over ferry costs,2026-02-18T13:17:43.063Z," George Thorpe
Channel Islands
","An animal transport firm will no longer service the Channel Islands due to rising costs linked to new ferry contracts, bosses say.
The Pet Bus said the route had become unviable after the islands chose separate ferry operators - Jersey is serviced by DFDS while Brittany Ferries operates in Guernsey.
Lesley Ford, who co-owns the Oxfordshire-based company, said the loss of a reliable inter-island service had doubled travel times and increased costs. Since launching in Jersey in 2025, DFDS has put forward proposals for a new inter-island ferry.
The BBC has contacted the Government of Jersey, the States of Guernsey, DFDS and Brittany Ferries for comment.
Ford said the company used to bring animals to the Channel Islands in one round trip, but it now had to do individual journeys to Jersey and Guernsey, while a reduction in high-speed crossings had also proved challenging.
""It's become more complex and more expensive,"" she said.
""For us as a business, we have to ensure that the route is profitable because we have to be able to invest back into the business at some point.""
Ford the decision to cut services had been ""emotional"" and the company's staff would miss visiting the Channel Islands.
She said there was the possibility of returning in the future if services change.
Ford said: ""I think we will always really need the back up of the ferry services, especially for when we bring larger animals, so we're always going to need to use the ferries.
""I think the inter-island service and high speed service for us certainly needs to change and maybe that will in the future.""

Suspected family-run crime gang targeted in raids,2026-02-18T12:30:05.060Z," Richard Baker
North West
","A series of dawn raids have ""ripped a hole"" in what was thought to be a family-run organised crime gang, making 21 arrests linked to drug dealing and modern slavery offences.
The police action was launched at 05:00 GMT, targeting homes in Salford, Manchester, Rochdale, Tameside, Bury, Wigan and Bolton along with raids in Merseyside and Wales later in the morning, Greater Manchester Police said.
Det Supt Joe Harrop said the use of children, some as young as 12, to sell drugs such as heroin, cocaine and cannabis for the gangs was a ""stain on our communities"".
Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson, who was among the officers joining the raids, said those involved in such offending ""deserve everything that's coming to them"".
Sir Stephen said the group were involved in criminality of ""the highest level"".
""Their method of operation is to exploit vulnerable people, young people and, frankly, simply to cast them off when they get caught, as people lower down the chain frequently are,"" he said.
Harrop, who heads force's serious organised crime unit, said the raids were an attempt to take down criminals ""at every level"" seeking to ""dismantle"" their hub.
The gang, which spanned several generations and had been operational for 10 years, were also suspected of being involved in money laundering and the ""taxing"", or robbing, of other gangs, police said.
Children recruited aren't ""fully aware"" of their roles working for such gangs, Harrop said, but often go on to ""rise up the ranks"", in turn recruiting more children.
Harrop also warned the public to be alert to the signs of potentially groomed children, which can include seeing them in possession of large amounts of cash and designer clothes.

Parents angered by lack of online safety strategy,2026-02-18T12:17:35.621Z," Chris Craddock
BBC Jersey communities reporter
","A parent said she is frustrated Jersey still does not have an online safety law almost a year after a review was launched into the issue.
Jersey declined to adopt the UK's Online Safety Act when it was drafted in 2021 which gave Ofcom powers to fine social media companies.
The government has launched a consultation about how legislation could work in Jersey.
Parent Vicky O'Neil said Jersey was ""sitting there waiting idly"" as other countries introduced a social media ban for under-16s, adding: ""We need to have robust tight regulation for online safety to protect our children"".
The Economic Development Minister Kirsten Morel criticised the UK Online Safety Act in 2024 and said it was ""over complexified"" but since then there has not been a vote on what online safety protections in Jersey could look like.
In the meantime the government has launched a consultation on how legislation could be used to remove illegal content and protect privacy.
O'Neil is in favour of following Australia's ban for under 16s being on social media.
She said: ""Until big tech can prove that their platforms are safe and that their platforms are okay and not addictive for children to be on, a ban needs to be enforced.""
She added: ""Children under 18 cannot drink but you are obviously going to get a percentage of those children that do have access to alcohol, but something is better than nothing which is what we currently have.""
Douglas Kruger is also a parent in Jersey, and does not think an outright ban would be the best approach.
He said: ""We do need to protect our kids at the same time we have to preserve liberty and freedom of speech... with a ban you can do more harm than good.""
Kruger added: ""We've watched this play out in Australia where kids can now no longer chat with their friends and that's not what we're after; that's not the solution.
""The developing childhood mind is not able to sustain the attacks from screens and from social media so it's a subtle distinction because we need the parental control - we do not need a government ban.""
The government also recently announced it was in favour of adopting a similar social media ban for under-16s and ministers would look at what options were available.
Chief Minister, Deputy Lyndon Farnham said: ""Protecting children and young people from online harm is a responsibility we take extremely seriously.
""We know that the digital landscape changes quickly, and our response must be able to change just as fast.""
The NSPCC said a ban would be the ""wrong solution"" and ""it would create a false sense of safety that would see children – but also the threats to them – migrate to other areas online"".
Guernsey's government is in a different position to Jersey's as it has permissive extent clauses in the UK's Online Safety Act legislation, which means it can extend parts of it into local laws.
The Committee for Home Affairs (CfHA) said it is ""currently monitoring the implementation and associated snags in the UK and considering how it may be extended here"".
Rachel Masterton from the Office of The Data Protection Authority said: ""A knee-jerk reaction to bring something in may cause more problems than it solves... I think we need to make sure that we do it right if we're going to look for a legislative way"".
She added: ""We're ready to get involved in any consultation process that there is locally with regards to either extending the Online Safety Act to Guernsey or creating our own legislation"".
It is also something that has divided opinion between young people in Jersey.
Victoria College students Robbie, 16, and Felix, 15, have been studying online safety in their PHSE lessons.
Robbie said: ""I feel like we should have the ban for under-16s... the reels and the short clips I feel like are not good for young minds"".
Felix disagreed and said: ""I'm personally against the idea of a ban... I just think that that kind of behaviour could just shift to a different medium if we try and limit technology"".
The lessons are led by PHSE teacher Gillian Silver who said online safety is societal problem that has to be addressed.
""I think the biggest thing they feed back to us is they would like their parents to be more involved in their online worlds,"" she said.
""We also have joined up thinking across our schools about what are the issues that young people are asking for support around.""
She added: ""I think it's really important that we hear what they're saying"" and lessons should be ""organic, reactive, and proactive to what's going on"".

Flights to remote St Helena resume after fire safety shut-down,2026-02-18T12:00:14.061Z," Beth Rose
","One of the world's remotest airports has re-opened to passengers after fire safety concerns closed it for more than a week.
Saint Helena Airport in the South Atlantic was shut on 6 February and a major incident declared when safety checks found the airport's fire engines failed to meet international standards.
Specialist parts were imported from Germany helping to bring two of the three tenders up to standard, with plans to ""look at longer term replacement options,"" the airport said.
The island's governor, Nigel Phillips, said he was ""delighted"" flights had re-started and was ""extremely grateful"" to those who worked to regain the Category 6 status.
A Category 6 airport refers to specific fire safety requirements which enables airports to accept aircraft with lengths between 28m and 39m and fuselage widths up to 5m.
The UK-funded airport opened in 2016 and is the only commercial way people can get on and off the island with journeys by sea taking several days.
St Helena, a British Overseas Territory, lies 1,200 miles (1,900km) off the south-west African coast.
It has a landmass of 47 sq miles (121 sq km), making it about the same size as Jersey in the Channel Islands, and is home to just under 4,000 people.
The closure meant some residents were unable to leave the island while others, including police officers and government lawyers, were stranded on the mainland in South Africa following annual leave.
Small aircraft flights, including for medical evacuations, were permitted to continue flying during the closure.
St Helena Airport said the first scheduled flight took place on 17 February after it ""regained Category 6 accreditation for its firefighting capabilities"".
""This is down to the incredible hard work and long hours put in by the mechanics at the airport, supported by specialist engineers,"" it said.
In a radio address to the island, the governor said that, once operations were back to normal, an investigation would look at the circumstances leading to the closure of the airport.
The island's chief minister, Rebecca Cairns-Wicks, who was elected last year, added the re-opening was a ""huge relief to everyone"".
""The last 10 days has been challenging but you have shown just how our community spirit, strength and resilience has helped to get through it. We can now get people to where they need to be.""
The airport added it was not selling tickets for flights up to and including 21 February as they would be reserved for existing ticket-holders and ""repatriation"" of those who had been affected by the closure which would be ""allocated based on length of delay"".

Police assessing Stansted Airport private flights over Epstein ties,2026-02-18T10:30:17.371Z," Rachel Muller-Heyndyk
","Essex Police has said it is assessing information about private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the Epstein files.
The BBC understands that while the police are ""assessing"" the information, it would not necessarily lead to a full investigation.
Last year a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to the convicted sex offender had arrived at or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018.
Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the New Statesman last week that police ""urgently"" need to re-examine whether Jeffrey Epstein's victims were trafficked within and outside of the UK.
An Essex Police spokesperson said: ""We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.""
In December, BBC News discovered that three British women who were allegedly trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK alongside other documents related to the convicted sex offender.
US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims told the BBC it was ""shocking"" that there has never been a ""full-scale"" investigation into his activities in the UK.
Brown said the scale of trafficking would ""become apparent"" if an investigation had been conducted into the flights.
The former PM wrote to the chief police constables and commissioner of the Met, Essex and Thames Valley Police.
He added that Stansted, located around 40 miles away from central London, was one of the airports ""where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another"".
Stansted Airport said in a statement: ""All private aircraft at London Stansted operate through independent Fixed Base Operators, which handle all aspects of private and corporate aviation in line with regulatory requirements.""
The airport said that these terminals are ""entirely independent"" and that ""no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal"".
Immigration and customs checks for passengers arriving via private jets are carried out ""directly by Border Force"", it said, adding that it does not ""manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft"".
BBC News has again contacted police forces in areas where Epstein-linked flights landed or took off from, including Police Scotland, Merseyside, Belfast, West Midlands, and Bedfordshire.
Our investigations team is sifting through the latest Epstein documents released by the US Department of Justice to see what other flights and trains Epstein may have used to travel in the UK.
The Essex Police statement comes as a new national group has been set up to support UK forces that are ""assessing allegations"" following the publication of the Epstein files, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has said.
Thames Valley Police is assessing allegations, reported by the BBC, that a second woman was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
The force previously said it has held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein during his time as the UK's trade envoy.
Elsewhere, Norfolk Constabulary said it was ""reviewing documents"" released in the US to ""ensure that all relevant information has been properly assessed"".
A spokesperson said the force had ""not received any allegations and is not currently conducting any investigation"", but that it was ""reviewing documents"" released in the US to ""ensure that all relevant information has been properly assessed"".
Last year, a BBC News investigation found one arrival and departure of an Epstein-linked flight at RAF Marham in west Norfolk.
Separately, the tranche of documents released in December included a photograph taken the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk of Andrew lying across the laps of women, with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell standing in the background.
The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.
Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.
Two properties linked to the former business secretary and British ambassador to the US were searched following the allegations.
The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.
Lord Mandelson has previously expressed regret for his continued association with Epstein and apologised ""to the women and the girls who suffered"".
He was dismissed from his role as ambassador in September, after Downing Street said new information had emerged about the depth of this relationship with Epstein.

Ferries resume but drivers warned of crashing waves,2026-02-18T09:14:11.114Z," Catherine Nicoll
Isle of Man
","Ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Lancashire have resumed after cancellations on Tuesday, but a warning of large waves crashing onto coastal roads remains in place.
The Manxman left Douglas for Heysham shortly after 07:00 GMT, an hour earlier than scheduled following the cancellation of Tuesday evening's crossing and its overnight return due to gales.
An amber weather warning for coastal overtopping has been put in place between 10:00 and 14:00, with Douglas Promenade set to be particularly affected.
As a result of the conditions, Douglas Council has urged drivers to avoid using the Bottleneck Car Park on Loch Promenade until the weather has improved on Thursday.
Other areas likely to be affected include Ramsey and Laxey promenades, with disruption on parts of Castletown Promenade and Shore Road in Rushen also possible.
The council also said the Eastern Civic Amenity Site would remain closed on Wednesday morning because of the blustery conditions, which were forecast to see gusts of up to 50mph (80km/h) hit the island.
Ronaldsway Met Office has also warned of slippery conditions on the island's roads, with a warning for ice in place until 16:00.

William says it has taken 'long time to understand my emotions',2026-02-18T08:15:26.736Z," Noor Nanji
Royal correspondent
","The Prince of Wales has opened up about taking time to ""understand my emotions"" in a frank conversation about mental health.
Prince William told a special episode of BBC Radio 1's Life Hacks that ""we need more male role models"" to talk about their mental health publicly in order to help other men do the same.
Taking part in a panel discussion about male suicide with host Greg James, he said that would help open discussions ""become second nature to us all"" and reflected on his own strategies for processing emotions.
Mental health is a cause close to the prince's heart, and his Royal Foundation is contributing £1m to develop a National Suicide Prevention Network.
According to the Office for National Statistics, suicide was the leading cause of death among young people aged 20 to 34 in England and Wales in 2024.
During the panel discussion, Prince William said he thought it was a ""real national catastrophe"" that the prevalence of male suicide in the UK was not talked about enough.
He reflected on his own feelings, saying: ""I take a long time trying to understand my emotions and why I feel like I do, and I feel like that's a really important process to do every now and again, to check in with yourself and work out why you're feeling like you do.
""Sometimes there's an obvious explanation, sometimes there isn't. I think that idea that mental health crisis is temporary - you can have a strong mental health crisis moment but it will pass.""
Prince William encouraged people to ""learn to love yourself and understand yourself"".
He also emphasised the importance of sharing your feelings, saying: ""Part of feeling comfortable talking about mental health is understanding it.""
When asked if his children talk openly about their feelings, Prince William jokingly said: ""Sometimes too much. I get all the details, which I love, it's amazing.""
He added: ""We need more male role models out there, talking about it and normalising it, so that it becomes second nature to all of us.""
He said support from organisations working in this area could also be ""that little stepping stone"" to get you through a difficult moment.
""And if we talk about that more, and educate people more, then hopefully the idea of suicide keeps being pushed further and further away.
""Because you know that tomorrow, you might wake up and you might feel very different.""
If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.
The panel also featured Allan Brownrigg, director of clinical services at James' Place charity, as well as musicians Professor Green and Guvna B, and a young man, Nathan, who shared his personal experiences on the subject.
Rapper Professor Green, whose real name is Stephen Manderson, has campaigned on mental health for years and previously spoke in a BBC documentary, Suicide and Me, about losing his father to suicide.
He said he ""jumped at the chance"" to be a part of the panel, and that it aimed to highlight ""the importance of discussions around men's mental health"".
The rapper, 42, said he also wanted to remind people ""that these conversations are important to have and it's okay to have them"".
""I've got a little boy and I hate to think of him growing up in a world where he doesn't have a circle of friends that he knows he can go to, or services that he knows he can access if in a time of need, at a time when he perhaps doesn't have me,"" he said.
Professor Green, who is a supporter of the suicide prevention charity Calm, said he felt it was ""incredibly important"" to have the support of Prince William, ""not least of all because of the openness that he shows up with, which I don't think people would necessarily expect"".
""But he's obviously gone through his own life of suffering and experience and things he's seen firsthand,"" he said.
""And I just think it enables us to shine such a light on something that people will otherwise just avoid.""
Prince William has regularly spoken about mental health and the impact of male suicide.
Last year, the prince was visibly moved as he heard first hand about the devastating impact of suicide.
He had to pause during an emotional conversation with Rhian Mannings, who told the prince that her husband had taken his own life, five days after the couple had faced the death of their one-year-old son.
The new National Suicide Prevention Network, bringing together 20 organisations in this field, will be chaired by Professor Ann John, an expert in the prevention of suicide and consultant in public health medicine in Wales.
The Royal Foundation says preventing suicide is a ""complex challenge"" and there is no ""one size fits all model of support"".
But the new network, which will operate across the UK, will try to understand more about the root causes of suicide, as well as offering support for those affected.
The prince's interview was recorded on 29 January, the day before millions of new files relating to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were released by the US Department of Justice.
Ahead of an official trip to Saudi Arabia in early February, the prince and his wife Catherine said they were ""deeply concerned"" by the latest revelations and ""their thoughts remain focused on the victims"".

Dual nationals face scramble for UK passports as new rules come into force,2026-02-17T21:41:07.110Z," Sean Seddon
Angus ThompsonandBernadette McCague
","When Jelena returns home from a ""holiday of a lifetime"" travelling around South America later this year, she faces being told she can no longer enter the UK.
The British-Latvian dual national is among those who say they have been caught out by upcoming changes to passport rules for dual nationals, which are due to kick in on 25 February.
Entry requirements for dual nationals are being overhauled as part of sweeping changes to the immigration system the government says will streamline and modernise the UK border.
But for Jelena, who has lived in the UK for 16 years, the changes are a ""betrayal"", and others in the same situation have told BBC News the prospect of being denied entry is causing anger and concern.
Here are how the new rules will work - and why Jelena and others like her are furious about it.
Under the existing rules, a British dual national - whose other nationality is from a country not subject to a UK visa requirement - could travel to the UK using their foreign passport.
But from 25 February that will no longer be the case.
Instead, they will need to show either a British passport, or a new digital version of the certificate of entitlement to attach to their second nationality passport - and without one of them, they could face being denied the right to travel back to the UK.
Neither British passports or certificates of entitlement are automatically issued to people who obtain citizenship, which means some dual nationals have never applied for them, even if they have lived in the UK for decades.
Both documents take several weeks to obtain and there are costs too. A British passport costs around £100 for an adult, while the certificate of entitlement costs £589.
These new rules for dual nationals are linked to the roll out of the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) system this month, a major immigration reform which will require visitors to the UK who do not have a visa to apply for a £16 entry document before arriving.
The government said it plans to increase the ETA fee to £20 in the future.
Dual nationals cannot apply for an ETA and must meet the new documentation requirements instead, with checks now carried out by airlines when departing en route back to the UK.
The new rules do not apply to Irish passport holders but other EU citizens will be affected.
According to the latest census in 2021, 1.2% of UK-born residents were UK-other dual citizens (587,600) and 6.5% of non-UK-born residents were UK-other dual citizens (648,700).
The government has said the reforms bring the UK's immigration system into line with countries like the US and Australia.
But critics say the looming deadline and a lack of communication around the changes have left people scrambling to apply for new documents, with dual nationals who are out of the country on holiday or visiting family facing the prospect of being stranded until they can acquire a passport or the certificate.
Jelena, who was born in Latvia and has lived in the UK ever since coming to study, became a British citizen in November.
The 34-year-old chartered surveyor told BBC News she delayed applying for a British passport when she became a citizen as she was travelling to see family for Christmas, so could not send off her Latvian passport as part of the application process.
Jelena only learned of the changes recently and is unable to apply for new documentation immediately as she is due to go on a long-planned trip to South America in a few weeks and may not get her passport back in time to travel.
""As it stands, after South America, I won't be able to return to my flat [in Glasgow], which me and my husband own, in the country I have lived in for nearly 16 years, studied in and paid taxes,"" she told BBC Your Voice.
Jelena intends to change her travel plans by returning to Latvia after her trip to apply for a British passport from there, potentially facing a wait of several weeks or months for it to arrive.
""I'm lucky that my employer is flexible about me working from abroad - if that wasn't the case, I wouldn't have a job because of this,"" she said.
""If I hadn't applied for citizenship and just had an EU passport, I would be in a better situation than I am now,"" she added.
""The irony is that I've chosen to be part of this country but it feels like I'm being deported. It feels like a betrayal.""
Petra Gartzen, a UK-German dual national who has lived in the UK for four decades, said she was furious at the lack of communication about the upcoming changes and is frantically trying to secure a passport from Spain, where she is staying for a few months over the winter.
She told BBC News: ""They changed the rules when I was already in Spain. There was no lead up, no major announcement - I found out about it from a Facebook post, and just thought, now what?""
The government says publicly available information has been in circulation about the upcoming changes since October 2024 but critics say it has not cut through to people affected.
Petra, a tech industry analyst, was told she would need to travel from southern Spain to Madrid for an appointment in order to apply for the ""ridiculously expensive"" certificate of entitlement while outside the UK, adding to the expense.
Petra has now applied for a UK passport from Spain - but that had its own complications. ""They agreed to accept a notarised copy of my German passport so I did not have to send that off, but they also wanted my original citizenship certificate - which I don't have, it's in the UK,"" she explained.
Petra now has a ""nervous wait"" to see if the documentation she was able to provide is accepted and processed in time for early March, when she is due to travel back to the UK before heading to the US for work.
She said she felt let down by the way the changes have been introduced, adding: ""I've been a British citizen since 2019. The UK is my home - I've lived there for 40 years, I own a home, I work and pay tax. My whole life is there.""
Swiss dual national Shaun West said he was considering not replacing his British passport and renouncing his citizenship over the new requirements.
""There's no worth in it for me,"" said the university professor, who became a Swiss citizen after Brexit.
He said he would rather pay the ETA fee to temporarily enter the UK to see his parents, adding: ""[The government] said I'll lose consular services. I'm not bothered. [They said] you won't be able to live here. I'm not going to.""
West said that he found out about the rule change ""utterly by accident"" by reading online about how it affected Canadians, and said he believed it was discriminatory against dual nationals.
Norwegian dual national Linn Kathenes, who lives in the UK, said she was only notified by the Home Office about the new rules last week.
The teacher said that the changes mean she is now in a race against time to make arrangements for an upcoming overseas school trip.
Kathenes explained that she is waiting to collect her Norwegian passport, which she had to renew. She needs to send over the document before she can begin the process of getting the UK passport required to travel.
""I don't see another way, I just have to gamble"", she said.
The Home Office has been contacted about her case.
Campaign group the3million, which represents EU citizens in the UK, has also criticised government communication around the changes.
""The Home Office has not done enough to warn dual nationals of the serious impact this will have on them,"" the group's head of policy and advocacy, Monique Hawkins, said.
She has called on the government to ""urgently hit the pause button"" and introduce a ""low-cost, one-off travel authorisation"" for dual nationals who have found their travel plans disrupted.
A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Public information advising dual nationals to carry the correct documentation has been available since October 2024 and a substantive communications campaign about the introduction of ETA has been running since 2023.
""This requirement applies to all British citizens regardless of other nationality and is the same approach taken by other countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia.""

Ex-Mail reporter denies making payments for Lawrence information,2026-02-17T20:25:43.679Z," Tom Symonds
News correspondent
","Former Daily Mail investigative reporter Stephen Wright has bitterly criticised claims he paid private investigators for information about the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry.
Wright told the High Court they were the ""most despicable allegations it is possible to put to any journalist"" and that the claims were ""utter nonsense"".
Giving evidence at the privacy case brought by Lawrence's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, against the Mail's publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), Wright said he was proud of the work he had done to campaign for her son's killers to be brought to justice.
Baroness Lawrence accuses Wright and the newspaper publisher of using unlawful methods to research five articles about the case of her son's racially motivated murder in 1993, based on evidence from several private investigators.
Baroness Lawrence is one of a number of high-profile figures, including Prince Harry and Sir Elton John, who are suing ANL for ""grave breaches of privacy"". Allegations include phone tapping over a 20-year period.
ANL has strongly denied the claims.
At the High Court, barrister David Sherborne, representing Baroness Lawrence, questioned Wright about whether the Daily Mail's reporting was partly motivated by a belief that the Lawrence family was benefiting financially from the case.
""I have worked tirelessly for 25 years to help the Lawrence family get justice for their son,"" Wright, a veteran Daily Mail staffer, responded.
""Mr Sherborne you should be ashamed of yourself ... given what Mr and Mrs Lawrence went through I wouldn't begrudge them any money.""
Stephen, aged 18, was stabbed by a gang while waiting at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London.
The Metropolitan Police's failures to properly investigate the five prime suspects in the case became notorious and led to the force being branded ""institutionally racist"" by a landmark public inquiry in 1999.
The Lawrences received £320,000 in compensation in 2000 for police failures.
Two men were were found guilty of murdering Stephen after a trial in 2012, but the other suspects have not been convicted.
The Daily Mail campaigned on the Lawrence family's behalf, running a famous front page in 1997 naming the five prime suspects in Stephen's murder.
Baroness Lawrence said in a previous case statement she believed the Mail was on her son's side but now felt she had been ""played for a fool"", alleging private phone calls and conversations were secretly recorded by investigators.
One of the investigators, Gavin Burrows, previously said in a witness statement he worked for the Daily Mail in phone tapping and ""blagging"" private information. He has since retracted this statement, claiming his signature was forged.
Wright told the court the reason he mentioned the retracted claims in his own statement was because ""for four years I've lived under a cloud of the most despicable allegations it's possible to put to any journalist.""
""Of course I had to respond to it. To deny it.""
Wright also strongly denied allegations he met private investigator Jonathan Rees and corrupt police officers in Thornton Heath pubs to pay them for information for stories.
Wright said in his witness statement he spoke with John Ross, an ex-police officer sacked for misconduct, who was a ""very good tipster"" he took to lunch once or twice a year to maintain contact. He however denied paying serving police officers for information.
Wright later called an allegation of paying a private investigator to ""blag"" information from Lady Lawrence ""absolute nonsense"".
Further questions were raised about records showing Wright repeatedly commissioning private investigator firm ELI (Express Locate International) to obtain information.
The former Daily Mail journalist said it was for legal searches of the electoral roll and land registry, which were difficult to obtain in-house.
However, Sherborne produced emails in court indicating the Mail newspapers had provided access to the electoral roll and phone directory for journalists' research.
He said reporters turned to ELI because it specialised in unlawful methods for obtaining ex-directory phone numbers and other personal information.
The case is set to continue throughout February.

Evening ferry sailings cancelled as gales return,2026-02-17T17:16:35.488Z," Catherine Nicoll
Isle of Man
","Gales have led to the cancellation of two ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Lancashire, with further sailings also at risk.
The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has called off the 19:15 GMT crossing of the Manxman to Heysham Port and its overnight Douglas-bound return.
The firm has also warned Wednesday's daytime sailings of the flagship vessel were also in danger of cancellation due to the conditions.
The disruption to ferry passengers comes alongside warnings for continued icy conditions and large waves breaking over coastal areas at high tide.
Ronaldsway Met Office has issued a 24-hour yellow weather warning for ice on upland roads until 16:00 on Wednesday.
An amber warning has also been put in place between 10:00 and 14:00 on Wednesday, which forecasters said would result in ""significant overtopping of waves"" bringing debris ashore.
Douglas Promenade would be ""particularly susceptible"", with Laxey and Ramsey promenade also at risk along with western parts of Castletown Promenade and Shore Road in Rushen, they added.
Gusts of up to 50mph (80km/h) are expected to hit the island overnight and on Wednesday.

Coop Mobile 'challenging' JT over number transfers,2026-02-17T14:50:51.511Z," Chris Craddock
Jersey
","Telecoms firms have complained about another company over an issue with transferring phone numbers, regulators have said.
Coop Mobile, which uses Sure's network, said customers who wanted to switch from Jersey Telecom (JT) had been unable to keep their existing number - known as number porting.
The Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority (JCRA) said it had received complaints from Coop and Sure about the issue and it was ""actively engaging"" with all the relevant parties.
JT said that, as Coop operated its service on a different network, swapping numbers over was ""complex"", but porting between the firms formed part of a ""significant network upgrade programme"", which was in its final stages.
Channel Islands Coop chief executive Mark Cox said in a letter to members it was ""disappointing"" number porting was not possible.
Cox said: ""We're actively challenging this with the regulator and will continue to push hard to have number transfers made available as soon as possible.""
A JT spokesperson said upgrade work had been under way for four years and implementing the number porting change required detailed technical configuration and coordination between operators.
""Once the necessary configuration has been received and reviewed, we will determine how this work can best be scheduled within the programme,"" the spokesperson said.
Sure Group CEO Alistair Beak said JT had not enabled number porting to and from the Coop network despite having ""ample time and successfully testing the process"".
""This creates an unnecessary barrier for customers wishing to switch and undermines genuine choice,"" Beak said.
Sure and JT confirmed customers were able to move between those networks without losing their numbers, adding number portability was a ""basic consumer right and a cornerstone of fair competition"".
He added all licensed operators has a regulatory obligation to provide number portability.
""Sure has therefore submitted formal complaints to both the GCRA [Guernsey Competition Regulatory Authority] and the JCRA to ensure that JT fulfils its licence obligations and that a level playing field is maintained for the benefit of all consumers.""
JCRA chief executive Tim Ringsdore said the regulator was speaking to the firms along with counterparts at GCRA in an attempt understand and resolve the issue ""as quickly as possible"".
Ringsdore said the JCRA knew number portability was an ""important feature of a competitive telecoms market"".
He added: ""Our priority is to ensure that the mobile market continues to operate in a way that promotes fair competition and protects consumer choice.""

Cold health alert issued as temperatures fall across the UK,2026-02-17T12:06:53.375Z," Simon King
Lead Weather PresenterandMalu Cursino
","The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a yellow cold health alert for most of England, as north-westerly winds have brought a drop in temperature for many parts the country.
The alert comes ahead of the Met Office's yellow warnings for snow and rain in parts of England and Wales, which will come into effect on Wednesday.
During Monday night temperatures dipped as low as -7.2C (19F) in the Highlands and Tuesday night could bring similar figures across parts of eastern Scotland.
Although earlier warnings for snow and ice expired on Tuesday morning, the Met Office warned commuters to remain vigilant due to the risk of black ice and slippery conditions.
The UKHSA's yellow cold health alert covers all of England except London and the South East. The alert will be in place from 18:00 on Tuesday until 18:00 on Friday.
The agency warns that the weather is likely to have ""minor impacts on health and social care services, including increased use of healthcare services and a greater risk to life of vulnerable people"".
A yellow weather warning for snow across most of Wales and parts of western England will come into effect at 16:00 on Wednesday and will be in place until 06:00 on Thursday.
A separate yellow warning for rain will be in place for much of the south of England from 06:00 on Wednesday until Thursday at 08:00.
Tuesday has been a mostly dry with some spells of sunshine. But with temperatures only reaching 3C to 7C and a brisk north-westerly wind, it felt colder - particularly in eastern areas where wind the chill made it feel close to freezing.
Temperatures are set to fall close to freezing for most of the UK on Wednesday morning.
In parts of northern and north-east Scotland, temperatures could fall to -8C. Icy stretches are likely.
Weather conditions will become more unsettled again on Wednesday with a band of rain pushing in from the south and west. This could bring a mix of rain, sleet and hill snow, according to the Met Office. The forecaster said the system is being monitored closely with the potential for further snow warnings.
Later in the week, conditions are expected to turn milder, and although further showers are forecast, drier spells in between are also expected.
Meanwhile, 65 flood warnings and 178 flood alerts have been issued by the Environment Agency across England on Tuesday - concentrated in the south and the Midlands - following a long spell of wet weather.
Two flood alerts were in place in Wales on Tuesday for the lower Severn catchment in Powys, and south Pembrokeshire.
Jonathan Day, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said more than 24,000 homes and businesses have been protected but about 330 flooded.
With further heavy rain forecast for southern England and South Wales on Wednesday, and the ground already saturated, more flood warnings or alerts could be issued.

MPs may investigate Andrew over trade envoy claims,2026-02-17T11:43:50.365Z," Anna Lamche
","MPs may investigate Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor for his conduct while working as a trade envoy for the UK, the chairman of the cross-party Business and Trade Committee has said.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Liam Byrne said his committee would meet next Tuesday to decide ""how we might or might not take this investigation forward"".
The latest files released by the US Department of Justice appear to show the former prince forwarded sensitive government documents and commercial information to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.
MPs are taking the allegations ""acutely seriously"", Byrne said.
""And I can guarantee you that MPs are not in the market for letting anything slip through the cracks,"" he added.
""My job as the chair is to make sure that the options are on the table in front of them when we consider it next week when Parliament resumes.""
The former Duke of York served as a UK trade envoy between 2001 and 2011. In this role he travelled globally and enjoyed privileged access to senior government and business contacts around the world.
In 2010, Andrew appears to have forwarded government reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore and China to Epstein, according to the recently published files.
The documents also appear to show Andrew forwarded Epstein information on investment opportunities in gold and uranium in Afghanistan.
Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.
Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct. Andrew has previously strongly denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein and rejected any suggestion he used his time as trade envoy to further his own interests.
Earlier in February, Thames Valley Police confirmed it was assessing whether there are grounds to investigate a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic, which reported Mountbatten-Windsor for suspected misconduct in public office and breach of official secrets.
King Charles has previously said Buckingham Palace was ready to support the police as they considered allegations against his brother Andrew.
Byrne said parliamentary recess meant the Business and Trade Committee had not yet had a chance to consider the allegations about Andrew, but added he was working to ensure ""the committee's got options in front of them when they meet on Tuesday for how we might or might not take this investigation forward"".
He said he couldn't ""pre-judge"" the committee's decision about whether an investigation was necessary, but added: ""At this stage, all I can say is nothing is off the table"".
In theory select committees - cross-party groups of MPs covering specific policy areas - have the power to force witnesses to attend a session to answer questions.
However, this does not apply to members of the Royal Family and such an appearance would be unprecedented.
In practice, there are few repercussions if someone does refuse to attend.
Bryne, the MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North, is the latest person to suggest the former Duke of York could face an investigation for his conduct while serving as a UK trade envoy.
Sir Vince Cable, who was secretary of state for business and trade for some of the former duke's time as trade envoy, said police should ""check on whether criminal corruption took place"" adding a ""government investigation"" was needed to explore ""how this was allowed to happen.""
Byrne's comments come as the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) announced a new national group has been set up to support UK police forces that are ""assessing allegations"" following the publication of the Epstein files.
It is understood the national coordination group will bring together affected forces to ensure consistency.
The group is not an investigative team, and each force will remain responsible for any potential offences that occurred within their jurisdiction.

Travel concerns cancel Alderney Literary Festival,2026-02-17T11:18:49.428Z," Chloe Parkman
Channel Islands
","A Channel Islands literary festival will not go ahead this year due to ""travel uncertainty and spiralling costs"", organisers say.
The Alderney Literary Festival has run every year since 2014, excluding 2021 due to the Covid-19 lockdown.
Festival founder Isabel Picornell said it had been a ""difficult decision"", but added it was not possible to get guest authors, professional support staff and regular festival-goers to the island on schedule. She said 80% of attendees would travel from off-island.
Organisers also said uncertainty around the future of Alderney's runway meant the 2027 festival could ""suffer the same fate"" because it was not known when or if the airport could close for works.
Guernsey officials warned Alderney Airport may need to close for an ""extended period"" to complete the scheme in the shortest time. Work could start in 2027.
The proposed works involve resurfacing and realigning the main asphalt runway, along with the taxiway, with a tendering process to begin depending on the outcome of a States debate expected to take place in February.
Picornell said: ""We have many world-renowned authors wanting to come to Alderney, along with regular visitors from overseas, including Guernsey and Jersey, so this news will disappoint a lot of people.""
Organisers said the festival had been previously deliberately scheduled in March, during so-called tourism ""shoulder months"", to bring people to Alderney when there were fewer tourists. However, flight frequency is also reduced during those months.
The Alderney Literary Trust said it hoped hopes to organise more single-author events as an alternative.

"Plan to build on green belt 'mad', says campaigner",2026-02-17T09:10:52.740Z," Paul Barltrop
West of England political editor
","Proposed plans to build new homes on an area of green belt are ""absolutely mad"", says a campaigner.
Protest meetings have been held in Saltford after Bath and North East Somerset (BANES) Council identified land on the edge of the village, which sits between Bath and Bristol, for potential housing.
Richard Skinner, who has helped organise two protest meetings, said: ""I think this is absolutely mad to convert this area here, this green belt, into grey belt so it's then easy to put houses on it. It's crazy.""
The council's cabinet member for housing, Matt McCabe, said he was ""very sympathetic to people"" worried about ""the land surrounding their communities potentially disappearing"".
McCabe said he was ""acutely aware of the demand for housing"", especially social housing.
It comes as the government raised the housing target in BANES from 14,000 to 27,000 new homes by 2043, a move which the council said would inevitably mean building on green fields around existing urban areas.
As part of a drive for growth, ministers are aiming for 1.5 million new homes across the UK by 2029.
Speaking at the Labour conference in the Autumn, housing secretary Steve Reed said: ""We're marching forward, backing the builders, stopping the blockers, we're going to build baby build.""
When he heard of the local housing targets, McCabe said: ""Jaws just dropped.""
""I'm asking them 'is this for real, how on earth does this happen?',"" he added.
The councillor said there were a number of challenges limiting new development in the area, including Bath being a World Heritage city nestled between hills and the fact North East Somerset includes areas of protected countryside in the Cotswolds and Mendips.
As a result, McCabe said the council's local plan, which sets out how BANES will develop in future years, will focus on expanding existing urban areas such as Saltford and Keynsham, which sit on the A4 between Bath and Bristol.
Both areas could see a combined 6,000 new homes.
BANES councillor Chris Warren, who sits as an independent and represents the Saltford ward, said: ""Everything which is being proposed for where we live will cause absolute chaos.""
On where new housing should go, Warren said: ""It's not for me to say where I feel, as a ward councillor for Saltford, where housing should go elsewhere.""
The council will finalise its local plan in the summer, with the final decision made by a planning inspector in 2027.

Guernsey's natural beauty tops visitor survey,2026-02-17T06:04:48.048Z," Perisha Kudhail
Guernsey
","The natural beauty of Guernsey has been listed one of the primary reasons visitors come to the island, according to a recent survey.
The travel and visitor information report revealed over 80% of participants said it was the main attraction which encouraged them to visit.
The Nature Commission in Guernsey said it hoped to work with the States to encourage tourism growth as well as preserve nature.
Jessi Jennings, CEO of the Guernsey Nature Commission, said the preservation of the natural beauty in the island would contribute to its economic growth.
Jennings said: ""Preserving the natural environment is really important and there is that balance between making sure that everybody can have access to the environment, to enjoy it, to connect with it, but also to reduce the disturbance on the natural environment.""
Deputy Adrian Gabriel, President of the Committee for the Environment & Infrastructure, said its goal was to ""connect people with nature and to enhance the desire to care for it"".
""Our committee provides £40,000 of grants every year through the Nature Commission to projects that benefit the environment and the local community.
""Previous grants have supported monitoring of marine mammals, restoring dune grassland and enhancing public spaces such as schools and churchyards, among many other projects that support our natural environment.""
Deputy Lee Van Katwyk, tourism lead for the Committee for Economic Development, said: ""Unequivocally, Guernsey's most valuable assets are its breathtaking natural landscapes.
""They need little to no enhancing but must be protected from urban creep at all costs.
""The Tourism Management Board are ever-aware of Guernsey's many strengths and will allocate grant funding accordingly.""
Sam Claxton, marketing manager for Visit Guernsey, said: ""Anyone can see the strong appeal of Guernsey's natural environment for potential visitors, and we're genuinely excited to be working with the Nature Commission.
""Their expertise and deep local knowledge will help us showcase the island's natural heritage and biodiversity more effectively.""

Rare turtle leaves rescue centre's quarantine tank,2026-02-16T17:30:42.476Z," Ros Tappenden
South of England
","A rare turtle that was flown to the UK after being rescued in Jersey has begun the next stage of its rehabilitation at a rescue centre.
Crush, the loggerhead turtle, has been in a 2,000-litre (440-gallon) quarantine tank since being brought to Weymouth Sea Life on 10 February.
Staff said they were ""thrilled"" with her progress since she was found washed up and apparently lifeless on a beach on 19 January.
On Monday, she was transferred to a 17,000-litre (3,740-gallon) tank and, once acclimatised, will be introduced to another loggerhead turtle.
When Crush was found by a dog walker, she was cold-stunned - a hypothermia-like condition that causes the turtle's body to shut down.
She was initially cared for by New Era Veterinary Hospital in Jersey, including two weeks at clinical director Peter Hawarth's family home, before he flew to Southampton, carrying her in a box.
Speaking to BBC Radio Solent's Dorset breakfast show, Weymouth Sea Life general manager Seb Webster said: ""We are absolutely thrilled with how crush is getting on.
""She's settled in really well, taken to food pretty much on day one, which is always a good sign.
""And we are pleased she's going to be moving into a much larger tank now to build up her strength ready for being re-released.""
Webster said Crush had been kept in the smaller quarantine tank to enable staff to check her more regularly in the early stages but was ready to be transferred into the larger tank by the specialist animal care team.
""We are hoping after a couple of days after acclimatising there, we will be able to introduce one of our other loggerhead turtles into the tank so she's then got a bit of company,"" he said.
The plan is for the turtles to eventually be released back into warmer seas.
Loggerhead turtles can be found in the subtropical waters off north Africa and it is believed Crush was swept north by storms and currents.
Others have been found in Sussex, Suffolk and as far north as Tyree in Scotland.
The species is classed as ""vulnerable"" on the IUCN Red List. There are an estimated 2,000 breeding females worldwide and out of every 1,000 hatchlings, on average, only one makes it to adulthood.
It is not known if Crush is female but rescuers have called her ""she"" because, like other females, she has a larger tail.

Ferry deal protected food supply chain - minister,2026-02-16T14:25:34.428Z," Georgina Barnes
Jersey
","A Jersey minister said it was ""really unfortunate"" having a separate ferry operator to Guernsey had increased food prices - but it had protected the island's supply chain.
Authorities from the two islands opted for different providers after a joint tender process failed to result in a unanimous decision last year, with Jersey selecting DFDS, while Guernsey chose Condor's parent company Brittany Ferries.
Sustainable Economic Development Minister Kirsten Morel said Jersey's choice was based on wanting a ""resilient service"" and the government was not confident in Brittany Ferries' finances.
Christophe Mathieu, CEO of Brittany Ferries, said the firm's investment track record ""speaks for itself"".
Mark Cox, chief executive of the Channel Islands Co-op, said the separate tenders had resulted in increased costs for customers across both islands because of port dues on top of flat-rate charges.
Morel said the costs had increased because freight costs had not been paid in the past, putting Condor Ferries in a financial predicament.
The minister said in November 2023, before negotiations had started, Condor Ferries contacted the Channel Island governments asking for £40m ""to continue operating"".
He said: ""If you look at Brittany Ferries' accounts, the end of 2024, Condor Ferries was valued at minus 130m euro (minus £113m).
""That is partly because the appropriate price for freight was not being paid and therefore Condor could not invest in itself.""
Morel said Condor came to the governments with two proposals before the tender process.
He said both proposals ""did not talk about investing in a future fleet except as in partnership with governments"".
""Jersey does not believe that we need government to be investing in a new fleet and we worked with Guernsey and came up with the view that actually the islands don't need to do that,"" he added.
Morel said with this belief at the forefront of him and his team, it could not choose Brittany Ferries as Jersey's ferry service provider.
He said: ""I want a long-lasting, sustainable, resilient service where the ferry company can invest in new ferries - that's what we have.
""If that has led to increases in prices, that's really unfortunate... but it just shows the real level of the cost of running a ferry service - I will not apologise for protecting Jersey's food supply chain.""
Morel said there was ""activity on both sides"" regarding the negotiations but argued Jersey had ""a much more transparent political system"" - saying only its side of the dealings had been made public.
In 2022, the States of Guernsey helped Condor Ferries buy a new ferry, claiming it was ""securing the island's sea links"".
In the deal, it provided £3m of taxpayer money and also loaned £26m to the company.
Morel said Jersey were not notified of the purchase, but believed Guernsey had ""a particular interest in a particular company winning"" and ""being the continued provider"".
Condor's then chief executive John Napton said in 2023 it could have found alternative funding for its new ship.
Morel said the States of Guernsey purchasing a vessel ""was fine"", but Jersey could not ""pay for that Guernsey decision"" with a joint ferry tender.
He said: ""There is a lack of transparency around the whole of Guernsey's decision-making system, we can see that in their decision to buy a ferry, no one still knows what the emergency was that led to that.""
The States of Guernsey has been approached for comment.
Mathieu said Morel needed to ""quit the blame game"" and ""take some responsibility for the mess he made of the Jersey ferry contract"".
He said: ""In Guernsey, this has been clearly reflected in enhanced service levels, more reliable schedules, competitive fares and a renewed sense of optimism – alongside a resurgence in tourism.
""Regarding investment, our track record speaks for itself - five brand new ships delivered in the last five years.""

Sting and Lewis Capaldi surprise at charity show,2026-02-16T13:09:04.226Z," Evie Lake
North East and Cumbria
","A charity variety show has been hailed a success after the first performance in six years brought surprise appearances from Sting and Lewis Capaldi.
Normally performed every two years but last held in 2020, Sunday for Sammy returned on Sunday at Newcastle's Utilita Arena to raise funds for local emerging artists.
The show, which features a host of well-known TV, theatre and musics stars from the north-east of England, began in 2000 in honour of actor Sammy Johnson, known for his roles in Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and Spender, who died in 1998.
This year performers included, Matty Healy, frontman of The 1975 and son of one of the show's founders Tim Healy.
The show was last held in 2020, but an attempt to bring the show back three years later failed due to the cost of living crisis.
Ray Laidlaw, from Lindisfarne and the show's producer, said he thought the variety show would ""never"" come back.
""Bringing the Sunday for Sammy show back after Covid and the financial traumas it caused seemed like an impossible dream,"" he said.
Laidlaw said: ""Last night the dream became a reality thanks to an incredible group of performers, a wonderful tech crew and our dedicated partners and supporters.
""A huge thank you to each and everyone of you.
""Sammy is back.""

Islands Forum scrapped after meeting just four times,2026-02-16T11:43:10.687Z,No Author Listed,"An initiative set-up to discuss shared challenges and opportunities faced by island communities has been scrapped by the UK government.
The Islands Forum was established in 2022 by the then Conservative government as part of its Levelling Up agenda.
But the current Labour administration has decided that the forum - which has met four times - should not continue in its current form.
Scottish island councils have expressed disappointment it has been wound up.
The Islands Forum brought together the three Scottish island councils - Shetland, Orkney and the Western Isles - as well as Highland, Argyll and Bute and North Ayrshire.
It also had representation from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Isle of Anglesey County Council, Isle of Wight Council and Council of the Isles of Scilly were all involved as was the Rathlin Development and Community Association.
The aim of the forum was to examine ways to tackle common challenges on issues like transport and housing.
Orkney Islands Council depute leader Sandy Cowie said he was disappointed the forum would not be meeting again as it had provided a positive opportunity to exchange strategies to confront challenges
He said: ""We wait to see if anything similar will be instigated. I have to say I am not optimistic.""
Comhairle Nan Eilean Siar leader Paul Steele agreed that the Islands Forum had provide a ""much needed and useful platform"".
The UK government said it was committed to helping islands reach their full potential and recognised it was important that they had their voices heard.

Team GB skeleton gold medallist says she discovered talent after Instagram ad,2026-02-16T11:23:48.400Z," Ella Kipling
","Team GB gold medallist Tabitha Stoecker has said she discovered her talent for skeleton after seeing an advert on Instagram.
Stoecker, 25, made history on Sunday with teammate Matt Weston, 28, after beating Germany by 0.17 seconds to win mixed team skeleton gold.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Monday, she said she initially trained as a circus performer, before coming across skeleton by chance on social media in 2019.
""I did flying trapeze, acrobatics, and I absolutely loved the performance element of it all,"" she said.
""I saw an advert on Instagram for Discover Your Gold Talent ID process and got selected for skeleton, and I guess the rest is history.""
Stoecker has previously said how she did know what skeleton was at that point, but she was ""at that age where you're not sure about things, and I wanted to test some other stuff out"".
Milan-Cortina is her first Olympics, with the athlete only making her international debut in December 2021.
Stoecker, who finished fifth in the women's skeleton finals on Saturday, also told Radio 4's Today programme that the circus had definitely prepared her for the ""adrenaline"" of skeleton.
Following Weston's individual gold medal win on Friday - Team GB's first of the Games - some 4,000 people have signed up to the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association's (BBSA) talent ID campaign.
More than 1,000 of the sign ups have been since the the team race on Sunday.
""We're delighted to see so many people wanting to try the sport and looking to emulate Matt and Tabby by becoming an Olympic Champion, said Natalie Dunman from the BBSA.
""Matt, Tabby and all our GB athletes started out in the sport by signing up in a similar way so we're confident there could be future Olympic medallists among them.
""Our athletes come from incredibly diverse backgrounds and that's one of the things that makes our programme so special.""
Weston told Today: ""The sport runs off people applying, giving it a shot and taking the opportunity with both hands. I didn't think I would ever be going to the Games competing in skeleton nine years ago … it's been an amazing journey.""
For those hoping to get into the sport, Stoecker advised: ""You need guts, and you need a dream.""
Weston said that anyone who fancies ""throwing themselves headfirst down a mountain"" should take the opportunity.
He also began his athletic career focused on a different sport, and competed internationally in taekwondo, before a stress fracture in his back forced him to retire.
However, Weston then broke his back doing skeleton about three years ago. He said: ""Skeleton isn't the safest of sports, but it's a hell of a lot of fun when you get it right.""
Unlike other countries, Team GB does not have its own ice track. Instead, skeleton athletes have to train on a push track at the University of Bath, which is the only one in the UK.
Weston explained on BBC Breakfast: ""We don't actually have ice to train on. Some other nations like Germany have four tracks so during the winter they can train way more than we can and hone in on their equipment and skills, they have the opportunity to do that way more than us.
""So that fact that we can come to an Olympics and beat them, feels pretty amazing.""
Stoecker added: ""I'm sure it is a little bit shocking how amazing GB can be with such a disadvantage with the actual sliding side of things, but historically we have done so well.""
Skeleton is one of Team GB's most successful winter sports, with gold medals previously having been picked up in PyeongChang in 2018, Sochi in 2014, and Vancouver in 2010.
Weston also said he is getting married in July - and Stoecker's boyfriend is the best man. ""Skeleton has brought us all together,"" she said.

Gloucestershire council tax to rise by 5%,2026-02-16T06:17:31.418Z,No Author Listed,"It is the time of year when Gloucestershire's local councils turn their attention to finances and budget setting for the fiscal year ahead.
And with that comes new council tax rates for residents.
Leaders have warned that local authorities are facing intense pressure to deliver more with less money.
This inevitably means an increase in bills for households and difficult decisions when it comes to choosing which services to invest in.
Over the next fortnight Gloucestershire's County Council and six district councils will formally approve how they will spend their budgets over the 2026-27 fiscal year.
Councils get their money from a number of sources, including funding from central government, council tax, charges for services such as car parking, and dividends from investments.
Authorities have to deliver a balanced budget each year to cover the cost of providing services, which includes social care, road maintenance and libraries for the county council, and bin collection, parks and cemeteries for the districts.
Total council tax bills have increased each year across Gloucestershire for more than a decade, and next year will follow the same pattern.
Council tax bills in Gloucestershire are split in to a number of sections.
The county council takes the largest section of the bill at 75%, with the police receiving roughly 14% and district, town and parish councils getting the remaining 11%.
For next year the county council is proposing to increase its section of the bill by 4.99% - which is the maximum permitted without the need to hold a referendum.
This breaks down to 2.99% for general council services and a specific 2% levy for adult social care.
If approved on Wednesday, this would see its part of the bill rise by £83.81 to £1,763.46 for a Band D property.
The leading Liberal Democrat group has said it will put more money in to road maintenance and Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND), but is also proposing to increase parking charges.
The six districts are planning increases of between 2.99% and 3.35% – taking their sections of the bill to between £155 in Tewkesbury and £252 in Cheltenham.
Police and Crime Commissioner Chris Nelson will be increasing the police's part by 5.7% to £340.
Town and parish councils are also considering hikes.
Due to the number of councils and individual boundaries it is difficult to give an accurate overall estimate for council tax in the county, but if all budgets are approved, an average Band D property will pay approximately £2,320 next year.
Councils across Gloucestershire and England as a whole say they are under huge financial strain.
Many claim they are being forced to take on more responsibilities and face higher service demands with less help from central government.
At the start of the month a Local Government Association (LGA) report found six in 10 councils in England said they will find it difficult to set a balanced budget for the next financial year, and eight in 10 will likely apply for help from central government under a process called Exceptional Financial Support (EFS).
Louise Gittins, LGA Chair, said: ""Councils are doing everything they can to protect the services people rely on but demand and costs continue to rise faster than funding, leaving many with no choice but to consider emergency financial support.""
When it comes to Gloucestershire County Council, 75% of its budget is spent on social services, statutory services which it has to provide by law.
Liberal Democrat council leader Lisa Spivey said this puts pressure on spending in other departments.
""The reality is there is just not enough money to go around, so when residents expect us to fill more potholes in, resurface roads, but also deliver adult care, children's social services, it's really really difficult,"" she added.
""What we really need is more money across the country.""
Central government has announced it will cover 90% the growing local authority debt around SEND services in England, which is estimated to reach up to £211m in Gloucestershire by 2028.
Even with this help, there are widespread concerns councils in England will only be able to provide statutory services in the near future, with others such as libraries and museums having to be cut back completely.
""Without a real injection of more money in to the system as a whole, we will get to a point where we'll have to make really difficult decisions about what we can do and what we can't do,"" Spivey added.
And it's not just large authorities which are struggling.
Gloucester City Council is currently waiting to hear if the government will loan it £15.5m to help keep it solvent.
It follows a cyber attack in 2021 and an over estimation of how much money its services and investments would make.
In a statement the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG) said it inherited an ""outdated and unfair funding system"" which it is ""taking action"" to fix.
This included ""making almost £78 billion available"" for council finances and £660 million for Gloucestershire.
""We are delivering fairer funding, targeting money where it is needed most through the first multi-year settlement in a decade, giving councils greater certainty to plan and invest for the long term,"" the spokesperson added.
""This will help councils deliver the high-quality public services local people need.""

Women calling for greater support with menopause,2026-02-16T06:04:05.777Z," Alex Osborne
Guernsey
","Women in the Channel Islands who have suffered severe menopause symptoms have said there is not enough support available.
Dani Barnett in Guernsey said she felt like she ""didn't have anyone to talk to"", at a time when she ""didn't know what was going on in her own body"".
In Jersey, Trudi Roscouet said: ""Women's health is not a priority for government"".
The States of Jersey said it was ""committed to strengthening services and support for women"". The States of Guernsey has been approached for comment.
In October 2021, Barnett, then 40, said it was a ""complete shock"" to be sent into surgical menopause overnight, and was required to have her ovaries removed.
""I had anxiety and overwhelm, my stress levels were through the roof. I was having anger fits that I had no idea why,"" she said.
Barnett, who originally from Canada but has lived in Guernsey for 20 years, and said: ""The brain fog was extreme.
""I could carry a meeting without any problems; but then I'd be sat there, not knowing what the name of something was that I've known for years, then you're embarrassed, then the hot flushes come and the anxiety and overwhelm and it was just all too much.
""There were days I cried because I couldn't find my slippers.""
She said her experience was extreme and she felt she did not have anyone to talk to.
""Every time I went back to the doctor they said: 'Your levels are fine, you're fine.'
""But I would sit there in tears and think I'm not fine and I didn't know why.""
In September 2025, she launched a business offering support to others in Guernsey because of her experience.
She said many women feared the menopause because they feared ""the unknown"".
She said: ""So, the more that we educate, the more that we talk about it, women aren't going to fear it.
""I'm a very outspoken person and I care about what happens to people.
""It's a support for women who maybe don't know what's going on with their bodies.""
She described the number of women that leave their jobs because of menopausal symptoms and a lack of support as ""outrageous"".
According to the British Menopause Society, 45% of women felt their menopause symptoms had a negative impact on their work.

In Jersey, Trudi Roscouet also created another business aiming to raise awareness of women's health and offer support after she experienced the menopause at the age of 51.
""Whether it's our children, partners, bosses, it can affect everybody and everything,"" she said.
She is also calling for more support in the workplace, highlighting how brain fog, anxiety and insomnia are the top three symptoms which affected women at work.
""The big thing we need to do is keep educating the corporates to support female employees in the workplace - and not just once in a lifetime,"" she said.
Under the UK Employment Rights Act 2025, all employers with more than 250 employees will be required to design and implement a menopause action plan to support menopause in the workplace and help women remain in employment.
Voluntary reporting is due to start in April 2026, with mandatory compliance by early 2027.
The plans are required to have evidence-based steps, such as flexible working, temperature control and manager training to reduce workplace barriers.
In May 2022, Jersey's government signed up to becoming a menopause-friendly workplace by signing the 51 Employer Pledge.
The 14-point pledge said menopause was to be treated with the same level of seriousness, care and support as other physical and mental health conditions, and that an individual approach should be taken and staff supported.
Roscouet said she believed there is more to be done, saying: ""I just don't think the government are listening about women's health anymore.
""Menopause they believe has been dealt with. Women's health is not a priority for them.""
In response, Deputy Andy Howell, Assistant Minister for Health and Social Services in Jersey, with responsibility for Women's Health said: ""We are committed to strengthening services and support for women.""
Howell pointed to dedicated clinics held at Rayner Outpatients and group-based sessions at the Listening Lounge which focused on coping strategies for living through the menopause.
She said the government was committed to developing a women's health strategy and would publish a women's health resource webpage later this year.
""We are building a stronger foundation for women's health and, as we move through 2026, our focus remains on delivering safe, supportive, and accessible services that meet the needs of women at every stage of life,"" she said.
At the Healthcare Group in St Martin's, Guernsey, a weekly menopause clinic is offered, led by one of the island's leading experts, Dr Lucy Joslin.
She said: ""I think we have some very good [treatment] options, and we can usually find something that will suit everyone in amongst all of those options.""
She also suggested other sources of support, including Guernsey Mind, the Menopause Discussion Group and the British Menopause Society.

"Police framed man for murder, new evidence suggests",2026-02-16T06:00:20.059Z," Bronagh Munro
BBC Panorama
","New evidence in the case of a man who has spent 23 years in prison for murder suggests he was framed by police, BBC Panorama has found.
Police knew the testimony of the main prosecution witness in the trial of Omar Benguit for the murder of South Korean student Jong-Ok Shin was directly contradicted by CCTV evidence, we have learned.
A total of 13 other witnesses used to support the prosecution case have now told the BBC the police pressured them to embellish their statements or lie in court.
Dorset Police did not directly address the suggestion that officers had framed Benguit, but said its investigation was ""thorough, detailed and very complex"".
Jong-Ok Shin - known as Oki - was stabbed to death while she was walking home from a Bournemouth nightclub in 2002. Benguit, an addict with a history of drug and knife crime, was convicted at a third trial in 2005, after two previous juries failed to reach verdicts.
The BBC has investigated this case over nine years, previously reporting that some witnesses had said they gave false evidence after being pressured by police. But Panorama's latest investigation reveals:
Phone records suggest Benguit had an alibi that discredited the evidence of the main witness and the police buried it
Police built their case around the testimony of a proven liar, even though they knew CCTV footage contradicted her story
Two additional witnesses say they lied in court after police pressured them
Four more people told the BBC that officers had tried to get them to give false evidence and they refused
The evidence of all the key prosecution witnesses has now been undermined or discredited
Witness testimony was crucial to the prosecution as there was no CCTV or forensic evidence linking Benguit to the crime.
After reviewing Panorama's evidence, retired murder squad detective Brian Murphy called for the Independent Office for Police Conduct to investigate Dorset Police's handling of the case.
The former detective chief inspector, who has been involved in more than 200 murder investigations, said in his view Benguit's conviction was not safe. ""This cries out for a review without a doubt,"" he said.
Des Jenson, Benguit's barrister, said that if police had coerced witnesses to lie, ""it means that they have manufactured evidence, they've perverted the course of justice"".
The murder led to intense pressure on Dorset Police, because Bournemouth's economy relies heavily on international students and the South Korean government wanted the murderer caught.
The police built their case against Omar Benguit around the testimony of a drug addict, who we are calling BB for legal reasons. She said she had been driving three people, including Benguit, on the night of the murder.
BB said she had stopped the car after passing Oki - and that all three men had gone to talk to her. They tried to persuade the student to come to a party and, when she refused, Benguit stabbed her, she said.
BB had a history of making false allegations and her account contradicted Oki's dying testimony, that she had been stabbed by a single, masked attacker.
During the investigation, BB had also changed her story - initially accusing two other men, before naming Benguit in her third statement to the police.
Panorama has now discovered that police viewed CCTV footage during their investigation which discredited BB's story.
In her third and final statement, she claimed she had stopped at a BP garage on Charminster Road in Bournemouth before picking up Benguit and the others.
But Panorama has found that when police checked CCTV cameras, they could not find any footage of BB or the men.
It was the same with her description of what happened after the murder. She claimed she had driven the three men to what was then a crack house a mile away to get cleaned up.
There was a CCTV camera across the road and police could see footage of addicts going in and out. But they did not find any evidence of BB, the three men or the car.
BB's account was the only evidence placing Benguit at the murder scene, but her account was supported in court by witnesses who gave evidence about his actions before and after the murder. Most of them were also drug addicts.
Leanne is one of the witnesses who has previously admitted to lying in court. She was just 17 at the time and said she had been pressured into signing a false statement in the back of a police car.
""I was a kid and I was thrown in the back of a car. I was petrified. There was already a statement wrote out,"" she said.
""And then when they start asking me questions, they start crossing things out, putting other things in. It's like they started with a template or something. This statement was their words, 95% of it.""
Panorama has now obtained more evidence that suggests some officers may have been deliberately trying to frame Benguit.
Police interviewed five drug addicts who had been at the crack house that night and they all initially denied having seen him there.
But when they were re-interviewed months later, all five changed their stories in the same way. They all said they had seen Omar Benguit on the night of the murder and that he had been covered in blood.
It was their evidence in court that helped to convict him.
One of the crack house witnesses had already told the BBC she lied in court.
Panorama has now tracked down two more of them. One, who asked to remain anonymous, said the police pressured her to change key details.
The second witness, Andi Miller, said BB had told the police about dozens of thefts they had committed together, and the police used that to get him to tell lies.
""They had me bang to rights on jobs, you know what I mean?"" he said. ""And I never got charged for any of it. I felt as though the police pressurised me into saying something that wasn't true.""
The BBC has also spoken to the family and friends of the last two crack house witnesses. They say the couple have admitted lying in court.
Along with the 13 who told the BBC they were pressured to embellish their evidence or lie, that means the evidence of 15 key prosecution witnesses has now been discredited or undermined.
The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) is currently considering Omar Benguit's case, after the BBC discovered CCTV evidence in 2021.
It was grainy CCTV footage of a man who looked like Benguit using a phone box on Charminster Road about 25 minutes after the murder.
If the man in the footage is him, then he cannot have been at the crack house cleaning up, as BB claimed.
The CCRC discovered that 135 CCTV tapes from the original police investigation had gone missing.
The commission has concluded it was possible that the man in the grainy phone box footage was Benguit, but it could not be sure.
Now, Panorama has uncovered new evidence that strengthens the possible alibi.
At the time, Benguit and other addicts were regularly using the phone box on Charminster Road to arrange drug purchases with their dealer.
Documents obtained by Panorama show a call was made from the phone box to Benguit's dealer at the exact time that the man who looks like him was captured on CCTV.
The combination of the CCTV footage and the phone records strongly suggests that Omar Benguit was in the phone box that night and has an alibi that disproves the crack house evidence.
The programme has also discovered that the police were aware of this potential alibi at the time.
They knew the man in the phone box resembled Benguit and they knew that a call had been made to his dealer at exactly the same time. Rather than investigating the alibi properly, police appear to have buried it.
Criminologist Barry Loveday, who has been researching the case for 20 years, said Dorset Police has serious questions to answer.
""The police were highly selective in the way they collected evidence. In my opinion, Omar was framed. This was a quite elaborate frame-up,"" he said.
There is a possible motive for the police to try to frame Benguit - their failure to stop a suspected murderer from killing again.
Danilo Restivo was suspected of murdering a 16-year-old student in Italy before he moved to England in 2002.
He lived just three streets from where Oki was killed and he was an early suspect in her murder too.
A woman reported to police that she heard Restivo discussing details of Oki's murder that had not been made public.
Italian police then warned Dorset Police about their suspicions, but detectives stopped investigating Restivo after his girlfriend gave him an alibi.
Four months later, Restivo killed his neighbour Heather Barnett in a brutal attack. It was another nine years before he was convicted of her murder and the earlier murder of 16-year-old Elisa Claps in Italy.
In 2014, the Court of Appeal discounted Restivo as a suspect because Oki's murder was different from the other two killings.
But now Panorama has found a grainy CCTV image that could be him. It shows a man on a bike just around the corner from the murder scene and it was recorded about 10 minutes before Oki was killed.
Panorama wrote to Restivo about Oki's murder, but he did not respond. Neither did BB.
Omar Benguit is now clean of drugs. Having served 23 years, he could now be eligible for parole if he admitted murdering Oki. But the 53-year-old told Panorama he could not confess to something he had not done.
""I'd rather die in prison saying I didn't do it, than get released now saying that I did do it. It's not going to happen. I'm an innocent man. Why should I lie just to get out?"" he said.
A Dorset Police spokesperson said that Omar Benguit had appealed twice against his conviction and that his claims of wrongful conviction had been dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
""This case has been through a series of reviews and any matter surrounding concerns regarding this conviction is ultimately a matter for the CCRC and the Court of Appeal,"" the spokesperson said.
The force said it would ""instigate investigations if directed by the courts and responsible authorities"", adding: ""As always, our thoughts are with Oki's family and friends who remain devastated by their loss.""

"Children 'weaponised' by both sides of trans debate, Cass says",2026-02-15T07:33:56.533Z," Laura Kuenssberg
Presenter
Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg
","Children have been ""weaponised"" by both sides of a toxic debate about transgender rights, the author of a government review into the treatment of children and young people questioning their gender has said.
Dr Hilary Cass told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg ""people at the extremes"" had caused ""quite a lot of distress for young people"".
She also suggested ""unrealistic images and expectations on social media"" had misled children, and that if some young people had ""taken more time"" they might not have pursued medical treatments.
Her 2024 review found gender medicine had been operating on ""shaky foundations"" when it came to evidence for medical treatment.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, she said there was a ""lack of realism about what transition would really mean and how hard it would be"" - pointing to ""quite intensive medical treatments"" and ""sometimes quite brutal surgeries"".
She added: ""There are a tiny number of people who will never be comfortable with their biological sex, with the gender associated with their biological sex.
""And for them, a medical pathway is the only way they're going to live their life comfortably. And we don't understand why that is, but we have to try and help those people thrive as much as the young people who are going to grow out of this.""
The review was commissioned after concerns about the treatment of growing numbers of children and young people with worries about their gender, particularly at the Tavistock Clinic in London
When asked how many children with distress about their gender would experience that same distress into adulthood, Cass said it was impossible to assess precisely, but it would be a ""really tiny number"".
The paediatrician added: ""When the clinic started, there were about 50 children a year in the UK, and then by the time I started my review it had shot up to 3,500 a year.
""We tried very hard to find out from the Tavistock what happened to the ones who didn't go on medical pathway. They just didn't follow them up and they didn't have that data.
""So that's one chunk of children who don't go on a medical pathway, then there are all the ones that me and parents and teachers will tell you about who go through two or three years of gender questioning and then desist.""
Asked if children had been let down by an adult-led debate, Cass said ""absolutely"", adding they ""were also caught up in all the issues about single-sex spaces and sports and safe areas for women which were actually not to do with the children but they were somehow part of a football within it"".
""That's a real shame that children have been weaponised.""
The vast majority of people in the middle of the debate were silent while the ""people at the extremes"" and rhetoric in the media had been ""frightening for young people,"" the clinician said.
She added that some activists for trans rights had been ""so strident that it's made it more difficult for trans people themselves who are just trying to live under the radar"", while equally people who had taken the view no-one should ever transition had ""similarly made it difficult"".
Cass, who praised the government's guidance for schools in England published earlier this week, said it was important for there to be caution about very young children beginning the transitioning process because ""if they socially transition too early we think they can get locked onto a trajectory that may not have been the correct natural trajectory for them"".
Asked about why the number of children and young people who have gender dysphoria is increasing, Cass said it was ""complex"" but there was a different cultural context, with people ""less locked into gender stereotypes"".
""I think what has kind of misled children is the belief that if you are not a typical girl, if you like playing with trucks, or boys who like dressing up or that you have same-sex attraction that means that you're trans and actually it's not like that but those are all normal variations,"" she said.
""I think children and young people were being given a narrative that it's not okay to be anything but absolutely typical of the other girls on Instagram.""
Cass also said it was ""vital"" that a controversial trial of puberty blockers for under-16s went ahead, or ""we're going to have ongoing charlatans just handing out inappropriate drugs"", pointing to the private sale of the drugs - particularly online.
Puberty blockers - which suppress the hormones that cause puberty - are often prescribed to children questioning their gender as a way of stopping physical changes such as breast development or facial hair.
They were banned for under-18s after the Cass review raised concerns about their safety, but a clinical trial to assess their safety was announced last year.
Campaigners have questioned the ethics of it, while the charity Stonewall said it was ""vitally important"" that all LGBTQ+ people have access to high-quality, evidence-based and timely healthcare.
Cass denied that she had stopped young people and families getting the help they needed, saying the new centres would make sure people had ""individualised treatment"".
""The biggest hurdle at the moment is they are still working through the big backlog,"" she said.

The Victorian aristocrat who became first British Muslim lord,2026-02-15T07:28:46.143Z," Rumeana Jahangir
North West
","It's nearly 200 years since the birth of a British aristocrat who became the first Muslim member of the House of Lords.
But few have heard of Lord Henry Stanley, who ""defied convention and his family's wishes"" when he converted to Islam in 1859, according to historian Jamie Gilham.
Little remains of Stanley's letters and diaries ""which is really frustrating but adds to the idea that he was a private man,"" he said.
Since medieval times, a relatively small number of Brits had become Muslims while travelling abroad.
But Gilham said Stanley was notable as he had influence politically and on his lands in Cheshire and Anglesey.
Born in 1827, Stanley was the eldest of 10 children given free rein to develop their own thoughts and beliefs.
The wider family, whose aristocratic ancestors can be traced to Norman times, had members belonging to various Christian denominations and at least one who was Jewish during Victorian times.
Family historian Lady Stanley of Alderley, who is married to the current Lord Stanley, said they were ""free thinking"" and born to educated, well-travelled mothers.
""They were people who did things,"" she added. ""It was acceptable to be argumentative.
""Thinking, debate, discussions were OK as opposed to a 'get off my land, I'm going shooting' attitude.""
Like many educated Victorians, Stanley was dazzled as a child by travelogues and the Arabian Nights tales.
He also had a hearing impairment which affected his schooling, and he left Eton after one year to study with a private tutor.
Gilham said Stanley's father, who was an MP, and his mother - who helped establish the first women's college at Cambridge University - had ""great expectations for their first-born"".
However his struggles with hearing meant ""his family worried greatly about his future prospects"".
""He only really started to shine when he went to Cambridge and learned Arabic,"" Gilham added.
Within a year, the 20-year-old was employed as an assistant to the then Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston in 1847.
Over the following decade, Stanley worked for the diplomatic service, with postings in the Turkish-based Ottoman Empire, as well as Greece and Bulgaria.
""Stanley came to appreciate the social and the spiritual benefits Islam provided the Ottomans,"" Gilham said.
It was also a time when various European empires were reaching their peak yet faced republican or nationalistic revolts.
""From letters, we see that Stanley experienced both political and spiritual crises,"" Gilham added.
""He didn't lose faith in God but he certainly had theological doubts. He did question the literal accuracy of the Bible, for example, and the letters between his parents show that he didn't go to church for the first time in his life.
""Unusually for Britain in the mid-Victorian period, Stanley did gravitate towards Islam - the religion of the Ottoman Turks - and symbolically at that time, around 1849-50, he gave up wine.""
Disillusioned with Britain's expanding imperialism, Stanley quit the diplomatic service in 1858 and decided to become a Muslim some months later while travelling in Arabia.
""There's little account of his religious conversion and beliefs,"" Gilham said. ""It's just things that you can read in some of the family letters.""
Press reports of Stanley's conversion emerged in Sri Lanka on his visit there in 1859, before news travelled back home to Cheshire - where it was reported in the local Macclesfield Courier and then the national outlets in London.
Some reported that he made a pilgrimage to Islam's holiest site in Mecca and adopted the name Abdul Rahman - Arabic for ""servant of the merciful Lord"" - although evidence is unclear, Gilham added.
""Letters show his parents were absolutely furious and equally embarrassed and humiliated that their son would convert to Islam from Christianity.
""His father said to his mother, 'Is he mad? What can he possibly mean by parading himself in our colonies and our possessions in the degrading position he occupies?'
""His mother replied to his father that the newspaper report in the Macclesfield Courier 'made me feel sick'.""
They later issued a public denial that their son had converted to Islam however Stanley wrote to one of his brothers that ""I have always been a Mussulman [Muslim] at heart"".
In 1862, he married a Spanish Catholic lady in Algeria under Islamic law, but kept their relationship secret until his father's death seven years later.
It emerged his wife was already legally married to a Spanish man at the time of their wedding, although it's unclear if Stanley was aware of this, Gilham said.
The couple registered their marriage under English law after he became the third Lord Stanley of Alderley and second Baron Eddisbury on his father's death in 1869.
""The Spanish husband was still alive until 1870 so again, the marriage wasn't actually valid.
""But it was eventually made valid when they remarried in 1874 and that was a Roman Catholic ceremony, which kind of raised eyebrows,"" Gilham explained.
""I think he was respecting the religion of his partner, his wife.""
After inheriting his father's lands and titles, he took his place as a non-partisan crossbench peer in the House of Lords in 1869 and became its first Muslim member.
""I don't know how many of his peers would have known that he was a Muslim,"" Gilham said.
""I guess they would have because they read the newspapers and knew he was involved in Orientalist societies.""
Lord Stanley inherited lands in north Cheshire, including the village of Alderley Edge - better known as an affluent area near Manchester that's popular with Premier League footballers.
""Famously or infamously, he did close some of the public houses on the Alderley Park estate,"" Gilham added.
Following the death of an uncle in 1884, Lord Stanley inherited the Penrhos estate in Anglesey, north Wales, where he contributed to the upkeep of local churches.
He also paid for windows with geometric designs rather than traditional figurative scenes, in line with Islamic rulings against the drawings of creatures.
""As a Muslim, Stanley respected Christianity as a sister faith of Islam - of its shared Abrahamic roots,"" Gilham said.
Eve Hawwa Iqbal-Khokhar, an English woman who converted to Islam and volunteers in the Manchester Muslim community, said she ""felt compelled to visit"" the churches after finding out about Lord Stanley's life just before a family holiday to Anglesey.
""History really excites me and learning about the first converts to Islam in Victorian Britain is so exciting - especially a local aristocrat of Lord Stanley's standing.""
She described the churches' designs as a ""visual feast"", adding they form part of ""a rich tapestry of our past"".
However as a supporter of the political union of the UK nations, Lord Stanley disapproved of teaching Welsh in local schools.
""He really respected language,"" Gilham said. ""But I guess in this case it was about the union and the union was more important to him.""
He described Lord Stanley as someone who ""didn't believe in the extension of empire"", adding: ""He believed in the consolidation of the empire as it was.
""And so he spoke out in the Lords about preserving the empire, but also about looking after its people.
""He was a conservative man but also a Victorian. He did defy convention in many respects - and a crucial respect in terms of religion - but in other ways he didn't.""
Lord Stanley died at the age of 76 during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in 1903 and was buried in unconsecrated ground on his Alderley estate, in a service led by an imam from the Ottoman Embassy in London.
""In some respects he was ahead of his time and he is starting slowly to be recognised and reclaimed to some extent,"" said Gilham.
""He was not showy and maybe that was to the detriment of his legacy but I hope people will start to recognise him a little more than maybe he has been so far.""

William and Catherine all smiles in Valentine's Day photograph,2026-02-14T20:17:40.070Z," Tom McArthur
","The Prince and Princess of Wales have released a previously unseen photo to mark Valentine's Day.
The black and white snap of Prince William and Princess Catherine was taken at Anmer, Norfolk, in April last year by photographer Josh Shinner.
It was released on the couple's social media channels on 14 February - a special but commercialised day for lovers across the world.
The photo was shared with the caption ""Happy Valentine's Day"" along with a heart emoji.
It is the second year the couple have publicly marked the day, after they shared a photo in 2025.
The still image shared last year was taken from a video released in September 2024, when the princess announced she had ended her cancer treatment.
The picture showed the princess smiling as the prince kissed her on the cheek.
Last year's Christmas card featured a family portrait that showed William and Catherine sitting on lush grass surrounded by spring daffodils, alongside their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.
The image was taken by Shinner in Norfolk earlier in 2025.
The Christmas card also marked another year in Catherine's gradual return to public life, as she continued her recovery from cancer and chemotherapy treatment.
On the other side of the Atlantic, William's sister-in-law Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, shared her own Valentine's Day photo.
A post on Meghan's Instagram account captures Prince Harry carrying their daughter Lilibet, who is carrying a string of red balloons.
""These two + Archie = my forever Valentines,"" Meghan's caption reads.

Andrew facing claim he shared Treasury document with banking contact,2026-02-14T02:03:37.936Z," Sean Coughlan
Royal correspondentandBen King
Business reporter
","Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor faces another accusation of sharing an official document, with reports that he gave a Treasury briefing to one of his personal business contacts.
Emails published in the Telegraph suggest that in 2010 the then Prince Andrew asked for information from Treasury officials on banking problems in Iceland.
This briefing was shared with Jonathan Rowland, a business connection of Andrew's, whose father David Rowland took over part of a failing Icelandic bank.
It means more pressure on the former prince over claims that he misused his public role by giving official information to private associates, at a time when he was serving as the UK's trade envoy.
Jonathan Rowland told the BBC he had ""no idea"" about the reference to him in the emails - and that the emails quoted are from legal proceedings from some time ago.
The Cabinet Office said it would not comment, but is not disputing the authenticity of the emails.
A spokesman for the Cabinet Office referred to Thames Valley Police's current position, in which they are assessing whether to launch an investigation into possible misconduct in public office.
On Friday night, the Times reported that police had held informal discussions with the government about emails and documents relating to the former prince and Epstein, before a potential criminal investigation.
Government sources told the BBC that they weren't aware of any discussions, but would not be surprised if a conversation had happened between civil servants and police.
Others in government would not comment.
""We will hand over what is requested of us on Andrew front,"" one source said.
Emails from the Epstein files suggested that Mountbatten-Windsor had forwarded official documents to Jeffrey Epstein, such as reports from overseas trade trips to south east Asia and a briefing by UK officials on investment in Afghanistan, described by the former prince as ""confidential"".
The information from the Treasury requested by Mountbatten-Windsor, via his adviser, was ""an update note on the latest position between the UK and Iceland on the matter of the deposits and the deposit guarantee scheme"", according to emails published by the Telegraph.
This was at a time when Iceland's banking sector faced problems, after three large banks based there got into severe difficulties, following the 2008 financial crisis, and had to be nationalised.
In 2010, there was a dispute between Iceland and the UK over whether Iceland should contribute to compensating UK depositors in the failed Icelandic banks.
Soon after receiving the information from the Treasury, the briefing was forwarded to Jonathan Rowland.
""I pass this on to you for comment and a suggestion or solution?"" wrote Mountbatten-Windsor.
""The essence is that Amanda is getting signals that we should allow the democratic process [to] happen before you make your move. Interested in your opinion? A.""
Jonathan Rowland's father David took over the Luxembourg part of the largest Icelandic bank, Kaupthing, which became Banque Havilland.
Jonathan Rowland was chief executive of Banque Havilland. He left in 2013.
The Epstein files reveal the closeness of Andrew to David Rowland, with the former prince calling him his ""trusted money man"".
It appeared that he was promoting Rowland's ventures to Epstein.
""He is actively seeking high net worth individuals for his Private Bank. Perhaps this is an avenue for your undecided Chinese?"" Mountbatten-Windsor wrote to Epstein, in October 2010, about Rowland's Banque Havilland.
Epstein replied: ""His bank just might be the place.. I guess i should learn more.""
The emails released by the US Department of Justice also seem to suggest that Rowland's bank had made loans to Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who faced debt problems.
Banque Havilland has faced problems with regulators in the UK and Europe, and lost its banking licence in 2024, a decision which the bank is appealing.
Rowland and his son Jonathan appeared to have had a close relationship with Mountbatten-Windsor, joining him on trips in his capacity as an official trade envoy, to places such as China and former Soviet states.
Mountbatten-Windsor had been a guest at the opening of the Banque Havilland and David Rowland had attended the former prince's birthday party and the wedding of his daughter Princess Eugenie.
Rowland's son Jonathan told the BBC he and his father ""never had any contact or correspondence or had dinner or met with"" Epstein.
Jonathan Rowland did not deny to the BBC that he or his father or Banque Havilland might have paid or lent money to Mountbatten-Windsor or Ferguson, but denied that he had ever provided money in exchange for access to contacts.
There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of Jonathan and David Rowland.
Andrew-Mountbatten Windsor has been contacted for comment and has strongly denied any wrongdoing in his association with Jeffrey Epstein.

High Court dismisses challenge to single-sex toilet guidance,2026-02-13T16:57:01.616Z," Alison Holt
Social affairs editorandJames Melley
","A High Court judge has dismissed a legal challenge to the equality watchdog's guidance on which public or workplace toilets and changing rooms transgender people should use.
The judgment urged businesses and services to follow the law, seek specialist advice, but also use ""common sense"" in how they organised facilities such as toilets.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) issued interim guidance last April and withdrew it six months later.
It said in situations where single sex facilities are required, they should only be used by people of the same biological sex.
It also said that, for instance, a trans woman - a biological male who identifies as a woman - would be expected to use a gender-neutral toilet or male toilets, not those for females.
Campaign group, the Good Law Project (GLP), claimed the guidance was ""legally flawed"" and ""overly simplistic"".
Three anonymous individuals also criticised the guidance, which is for employers and public services such as hospitals, shops and restaurants.
The judge, Mr Justice Swift, said the submission made to him was that ""in substance"" the guidance suggested service providers can ""require"" a transgender person to use lavatories that correspond to their biological sex.
""I do not consider this is a reasonable reading of the guidance,"" he said.
The judge continued that the decision to publish the update ""promptly"" contained ""no error of law"".
The commission's now withdrawn guidance was issued shortly after the Supreme Court ruled in April 2025 that under the 2010 Equality Act, the words ""woman"" and ""sex"" referred to a biological woman and biological sex.
Swift dismissed an argument from lawyers for the GLP at the hearing last year, that expecting a trans person to use a gender-neutral toilet could amount to ""less favourable treatment"".
The judge also refused an application by the campaign group for a judicial review but asked for submissions from all parties on whether an appeal should be allowed.
Friday's judgement said ""one clear conclusion"" reached by the Supreme Court was that if an employer or business provided a service used by both men and women ""then it would not be a single sex service"".
The judge criticised ""polarised language"" in legal submissions made to the court that suggested a trans person ""must"" use the lavatory that corresponds to their biological sex, or that the guidance assumed that women's rights ""trump"" the rights of trans people.
He also said that those who provide facilities should comply with the law but also be ""guided by common sense and benevolence rather than allow themselves to be blinkered by unyielding ideologies"".
Jess O'Thomson, the GLP's trans rights lead, said the group was ""deeply concerned about many aspects"" of the court's ruling but that it also showed that the law ""has been dangerously misrepresented"".
Gender critical campaign group, Sex Matters, also made legal submissions at the November hearing. On Friday, its chief executive Maya Forstater urged the government to issue the final guidance ""without delay"".
She said: ""The law is clear. There was never any excuse for the government, public bodies, regulators, charities or businesses to delay in implementing the Supreme Court judgement.""
The chair of the EHRC, Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, welcomed the judgement's finding that its guidance was lawful.
""It's our job to champion everyone's rights under the Equality Act, including those with the protected characteristics of sex, sexual orientation and gender reassignment. A shared and correct understanding of the law is essential to that endeavour,"" she said.
The EHRC's full guidance or code of practice is still being considered by the government.

Man pleads not guilty to Ian Watkins murder,2026-02-13T12:10:41.290Z," Hayley Coyle
Leeds Crown Court
","A man has pleaded not guilty to murdering disgraced Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins in prison.
Appearing at Leeds Crown Court, Rashid Gedel, 25, denied killing the 48-year-old at the maximum security HMP Wakefield on 11 October.
Gedel, referred to as Rico Gedel during Friday's proceedings, is charged alongside Samuel Dodsworth, 43, with murdering Watkins, who was serving a 29-year sentence for child sex offences.
Dodsworth, who pleaded not guilty at a previous hearing, and Gedel are due to stand trial in May.
Both Gedel and Dosworth have also pleaded not guilty to possessing a makeshift knife at the prison.
Watkins, from Pontypridd in Wales, had risen to fame in the 2000s with Lostprophets, who achieved 11 top 40 UK hits and a chart-topping album.
But in December 2013, he was jailed for a string of child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby.

Church of England abandons proposals for same-sex blessing ceremonies,2026-02-12T22:28:50.304Z," Aleem Maqbool
Religion editor
","The Church of England's national assembly has formally abandoned proposals to deliver blessing ceremonies for same-sex couples in churches.
General Synod did vote to continue to look into the issue in the future, but bishops had already decided there were theological and legal barriers to having such ceremonies now.
There was emotional testimony from some gay Christians during the Synod debate and warnings that many liberals and LGBT people were abandoning the Church.
Church leaders apologised for the hurt caused to ""both sides"", with conservatives having also complained about a lack of clarity from bishops about traditional teaching about marriage and sexuality.
""This is not where I want us to be, nor where I hoped we would be three years ago. And I want to acknowledge that wherever you stand on the debate, I know that many of you are feeling angry and disappointed,"" said the Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell at Synod on Thursday.
In early 2023 after 10 years of bitter debate, the Church of England finally decided that, unlike some other Anglican churches like the Scottish Episcopal Church, it would not support gay marriage.
Instead, it proposed church ""blessings"" for same-sex couples, a move that was endorsed by a Synod vote, and a process was set up to try to work out how stand-alone blessing ceremonies for gay couples could work.
But this Synod has marked the end of that process, the work on which is estimated to have cost £1.6m.
Apologising for the pain caused, the Archbishop of York put forward a proposal to set up a working group to continue discussing the issue.
""You have broken my heart. I cannot believe that we are here again, after all this time, with only this to offer,"" the Reverend Charlie Bączyk-Bell, a gay priest and member of Synod based in London, said.
Dr Bączyk-Bell said the process had been a ""facetious charade"" and it was a ""false equivalence"" to talk about hurt caused to those who had been theologically opposed to the idea of marriage equality.
""It is not the same to have your entire self debated, ripped apart, dissected, insulted, trampled on in this chamber and more widely as though it were a mere abstract question,"" he said.
Through tears, Dr Bączyk-Bell apologised to LGBTQ+ members of the Church of England affected ""for what we continue to put you through"" and ""that we cannot celebrate you the way we should"".
Although both gay marriage and stand-alone blessing ceremonies for same-sex couples are now off the table in the Church of England, blessing prayers for such couples that form part of ordinary Sunday church services have been allowed since 2023.
The Church of England Evangelical Council (CEEC) has previously said same-sex blessings are ""contrary to the teaching of the Bible"", and during Thursday's debate, some insisted it was not just LGBT+ Christians that had been left scarred by developments.
""Those like me, who hold to the historic teaching, also feel that pain, and all groups need to be recognised,"" said Simon Clift, a lay member of Synod from Winchester.
Busola Sodeinde, another lay member of Synod from London said Anglicans in the ""Global South"" were ""wounded"" and felt that they had not been adequately consulted.
""To refer to them as 'homophobic' as some have, when they believe that they are seeking to remain faithful to God's word is not only unhelpful, it is gravely unjust,"" she said.
Although the decisions of Synod do not directly affect what Anglican churches around the world teach, some such churches have threatened to leave the Anglican Communion over the issue of blessings for same-sex unions.
But in 2017 the Episcopal Church in Scotland went much further and voted for marriage equality for gay couples.
And while the Anglican Church in Wales does not allow same-sex weddings, it has also taken greater steps than the Church of England by authorising blessing services for gay couples.
Although Synod voted on Thursday for a working group to be set up to continue to discuss the issue, some upset by the collapse of the process to offer same-sex blessing services warned many were abandoning the Church in disappointment.
At the end of Thursday's debate, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Dame Sarah Mullally, addressed Synod talking of the difficulties of navigating the issue in recent years.
""It has touched some of our deepest theological views but also the core part of our identity. It has left us wounded as individuals and also as a Church and therefore I am grateful that you still are here,"" Dame Sarah said.

Lawyer for Mail publisher tells court she did not lie to Leveson Inquiry,2026-02-12T20:15:15.701Z," Tom Symonds
High Court
","A senior lawyer for the publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday has denied lying in 2011 when she told the Leveson Inquiry that the company had seen ""no evidence"" a private investigator carried out unlawful work for the papers.
Liz Hartley told the High Court that investigations had been ongoing when she made the statement to the public inquiry into press standards.
She was giving evidence in the trial brought by seven high-profile individuals, including the Duke of Sussex and Sir Elton John, who are suing the publisher for alleged ""grave breaches of privacy"".
In court on Thursday, Hartley said the allegation she had lied under oath had dragged her reputation ""through the mud"".
Publisher Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) denies all allegations of unlawful information gathering and says the claimants are ""clutching at straws"".
Hartley, who is the current legal director of ANL's holding company DMG Media Ltd, accepted it had been ""slightly bold"" to claim there was no apparent evidence of wrongdoing, because it was based on what she knew at the time.
In her witness statement she said: ""I was not satisfied on the basis of the evidence I had seen that Associated journalists had commissioned unlawful searches for information.""
She was questioned for nearly five hours by David Sherborne for the claimants, who have said ANL's denial of wrongdoing at the Leveson Inquiry was one of the reasons they did not sue earlier.
Sherborne put it to Hartley that she had seen evidence in 2011 which suggested Mail journalists had asked private investigator Steve Whittamore for information, and that he had been paid for using unlawful methods to provide it.
Whittamore specialised in getting unlisted ex-directory phone numbers for people journalists were writing about, as well as their ""friends and family"" phone number lists.
A criminal inquiry into his activities by the Information Commissioner's Office in 2002 seized Whittamore's notebooks, which showed the Mail newspapers had spent more money on his services than any other titles.
Whittamore admitted breaches of the Data Protection Act in 2005.
In August 2011, Hartley led an internal investigation looking at records of payments to private investigators ahead of the Leveson Inquiry that year.
It had examined evidence gathered by the Information Commissioner which included spreadsheets detailing hundreds of payments to Whittamore authorised by editors at the Mail and Mail on Sunday.
A series of invoices and payment records were shown to the court suggesting payments had been made by ANL to Whittamore.
In her witness statement to the inquiry in October 2011, Hartley said they had seen ""no evidence"" Whittamore obtained information illegally for its journalists.
Sherborne repeatedly put it to Hartley that in fact, the documents were ""important evidence about your journalists asking for Whittamore to carry out such searches"". Since the newspapers had been sent invoices by Whittamore, it was evidence the newspapers had in their own archives.
She responded that, at the time, ANL was continuing to investigate and was under time pressure. She said going through boxes of receipts was impossible because they had not been categorised.
Hartley said the internal inquiry was mainly relying on the spreadsheets of payments to Whittamore - which might have been inaccurate - not the notes of the private investigator himself.
The trial is due to last another six-and-a-half weeks.

Ratcliffe sorry language 'offended some' after immigration comments,2026-02-12T18:02:52.018Z," Ella KiplingandHafsa Khalil
","Sir Jim Ratcliffe has apologised for ""offending some people"" with his language after saying the UK had been ""colonised by immigrants"", but maintained an ""open debate"" on the matter was needed.
The billionaire co-owner of Manchester United had faced criticism from Sir Keir Starmer, who described his comments on Wednesday as ""offensive and wrong"".
On Thursday, Sir Jim said: ""I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth.""
The club has not directly addressed the remarks, but said it ""prides itself"" on being ""inclusive"".
""Our diverse group of players, staff and global community of supporters, reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home,"" the club said in a statement on Thursday.
""Manchester United reflects the unity and resilience of all the communities we are so privileged to represent.
""We will continue to represent our people, our city and our fans with purpose and pride.""
Sources told BBC Sport that the FA is examining whether Sir Jim's comments brought the game into disrepute.
Should the FA formally investigate Sir Jim's comments and choose to charge the 73-year-old under its own rules, he could face further punishment.
His earlier comments to Sky News had drawn criticism from Manchester United fan groups. He said: ""You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in.
""I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?""
He incorrectly claimed the population of the UK had risen by 12 million to 70 million people in the last five years. The Office for National Statistics estimates it has actually risen from 66.7 million to 69.4 million, an increase of less than three million.
A Downing Street spokesperson said it was ""absolutely right"" that Sir Jim had apologised for his language.
Following the billionaire's comments to the broadcaster, the prime minister's spokesman said Sir Keir thought they were ""offensive and wrong"" and it is ""absolutely right"" he apologised.
Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy said ""a lot of people find that language offensive"".
He added the government has ""done a lot to bear down"" on small boats and there is ""lots we need to do on irregular migration"".
Reform UK leader Nigel Farage previously pushed back against Sir Keir, saying: ""Britain has undergone unprecedented mass immigration that has changed the character of many areas in our country.""
Following the apology, he told BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast the comments were ""accurate and right"", if you ""take the word colonise out"".
""And what Jim is saying is that mass migration has done us harm and made us poorer. And I think he's absolutely right,"" Farage said.
Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said Sir Jim's comments ""go against everything for which Manchester has traditionally stood"".
""Footballers who have arrived from all over the world to play in Greater Manchester have enhanced the life of our city region.""
Criticism of Sir Jim's remarks also came in from football groups.
Anti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out called them ""disgraceful and deeply divisive"", while anti-racism charity Show Racism the Red Card said it was ""deeply concerned"".
""Language of this kind echoes narratives that have historically been used to stigmatise migrant communities, fuel division, and legitimise hostility towards minority groups,"" it said in a statement.
""Football clubs and their leadership hold enormous cultural influence.""
Ratcliffe, one of Britain's richest individuals, founded one of the world's largest chemical companies, Ineos.
In 2020, he reportedly moved from the UK to Monaco, which does not collect personal income tax or capital gains taxes.
He acquired a 27.7% stake in Man Utd in 2024, and has since restructured the organisation, making 450 redundancies, overhauling senior management and sacking two managers.
He campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 European Union referendum.
Ahead of the 2024 general election, he told Bloomberg he had ""had enough"" of the Tories, putting his support instead behind Labour.

Footballer Thomas Partey facing two additional rape charges,2026-02-12T12:55:12.926Z," Hannah Price
","Former Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey has been charged with two additional counts of rape against a new alleged victim.
It comes after the 32-year-old previously pleaded not guilty to five counts of rape against two women, and one count of sexual assault allegedly relating to a third woman.
It means Partey now stands accused of sexual offences against four women.
The two new charges relate to alleged offences in 2020 which were first reported to police last August. They follow a new investigation from the Metropolitan Police.
Partey will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 13 March for a first hearing relating to the two new charges.
The Ghana international was given conditional bail at Southwark Crown Court in September after entering not guilty pleas to the original five charges.
The alleged offences, which he was charged with last year, took place between 2021 and 2022 when he was playing for north London club Arsenal.
He was charged four days after leaving Arsenal when his contract expired at the end of June.
The charges followed an investigation by detectives, which started in February 2022 after police first received a report of rape.
The trial is scheduled to take place under a High Court judge on 2 November this year.
Since departing the Premier League, Partey has been playing for Spanish football club Villarreal. He joined on a one-year deal in the summer, with the signing confirmed after the midfielder had been charged with rape.
Partey joined Arsenal for £45.3m from Atletico Madrid in October 2020 and made 130 Premier League appearances for Mikel Arteta's side.
His lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire, has previously said he ""denies all the charges against him"" and that he welcomed ""the opportunity to finally clear his name"".

How to stay safe during a storm and what to do in a power cut,2026-02-12T11:36:52.232Z," Jennifer Clarke
BBC News
","Many areas across the UK from Cornwall to County Down have seen the wettest January on record, and heavy rain has continued in many places throughout February.
Colder weather and snow is also expected across parts of northern England and the Midlands over the next few days.
There are a number of steps you can take:
secure any loose objects outside your property such as bins, ladders, trampolines and outdoor games, garden furniture and tools
check fences and roof tiles are secure
clear guttering of debris such as moss and leaves
if possible, remove any loose or overhanging branches
close and fasten external doors and windows
secure storm shutters, if they are fitted to your home or business
park vehicles in a garage, if you have one; otherwise ensure they are as far away as possible from buildings, trees and fences
close and secure loft trapdoors
make sure you know how to turn off your gas, electricity and water in case you have to leave your home, for example because of flooding
charge mobile phones and any other critical devices including battery packs
gather essential documents such as passports and driving licences, and make sure you have contact and policy details for your insurance company
if you take medication, make sure you have a few days' supply
If you are in a flood-risk area, try to move valuable or essential items upstairs or store them as high as you can on the ground floor.
Strong winds can cause damage to buildings, such as tiles coming off roofs, and heavy rain can lead to flooding. Public transport may be disrupted.
People are advised to stay inside as much as possible and keep internal doors closed.
Unplug any non-essential electrical items in case of power surges.
If you do have to go out, you should avoid walking next to buildings, trees and the sheltered side of walls or fences, in case of collapse.
You should not attempt to repair any damage to your property or possessions while a storm is in progress.
The RSPCA advises bringing all animals inside and ensuring you have sufficient food, bedding and fresh water.
Listen out for bad weather warnings on local radio and TV, and check government and news websites for the latest updates.
In you become trapped by floodwater, you should go to the highest level of the building you are in.
Avoid attic spaces due to the risk of being trapped by rising water, and only go onto the roof if absolutely necessary. Call 999 and wait for help.
If you lose electricity you should make sure all non-essential appliances are switched off, but leave a light on so you know when the supply returns.
You can report a power cut online or by calling 105, which is a free service in England, Scotland and Wales.
Alternatively, you can find the details of your energy network operator by using this postcode search tool.
It may put you on a priority list for assistance if you have medical equipment in your home that needs electricity.
If you can smell gas and suspect there is a leak in your home, you can report it by ringing 0800 111 999.
Do not drive unless your journey is unavoidable.
You should steer clear of flooded or exposed routes such as bridges or high open roads.
If you do have to drive, make sure you have essential supplies such as warm clothing, food, drink, blankets and a torch, and carry a fully-charged phone.
Accelerate gently and drive slowly, and be especially cautious around high-sided vehicles and when overtaking. Give other vehicles extra room.
If you do start skidding, stay calm, steer into the skid and avoid sudden movements like hitting the brakes.
Turn on your headlights or use fog lights if visibility is especially poor.
Driving during a weather warning - including the most serious category, red - does not automatically invalidate your car insurance but it may make a claim more difficult.
An insurer might try to prove negligence, such as driving on a road when advised not to, and refuse the claim.
Most home building, contents and commercial business policies cover storm damage.
If you have suffered damage to your property or possessions you should:
not do anything that puts you or your household at risk
be especially careful around any exposed electrical or telephone cables
only return to your home or business after a storm when it is safe to do so
contact your insurance company as soon as possible: most have 24-hour emergency helplines, which can advise on next steps and arrange repairs
if necessary, arrange temporary emergency repairs to stop any damage getting worse. Tell your insurer and keep receipts, as this will form part of your claim
unless they are dangerous, don't throw away damaged items without discussing it with your insurer, in case they can be repaired
There is a common misconception that homeowners are responsible for the fences on the left of their property.
In fact there is no general rule about which fence belongs to whom, so homeowners should check their title deeds to see which boundaries they own.
It can take weeks or even months for a property to fully dry out after storm damage, so you may need to wait some time before redecorating.

"Sex offenders should tell police about pregnancies, review finds",2026-02-12T09:54:21.489Z," Lebo Diseko and Anna Lamche
","Registered sex offenders should inform police about their new partners and share details of any pregnancies, a review into the death of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon's daughter has found.
Baby Victoria's body was found in a shopping bag in Brighton in 2023, after her parents concealed her birth and went on the run in an attempt to avoid contact with social services.
Marten and Gordon, a convicted rapist, were both sentenced to 14 years for gross negligence manslaughter last year.
The review, chaired by Sir David Holmes, sought to identify missed safeguarding opportunities, and to learn lessons from what the review called the ""extreme case"" of baby Victoria's death.
Marten and Gordon had five children together, four of whom were taken into care prior to the birth of baby Victoria.
Family court documents show how over the years the couple moved around the country to avoid contact with social services when Marten was pregnant, refused antenatal and newborn healthcare and repeatedly missed contact sessions with their children once they were in care.
Given the repeating pattern of concealed pregnancies and child removals in the family, the authorities should have anticipated another pregnancy was likely, the review found.
Had authorities known earlier that her parents were expecting another child, more could have been done to save baby Victoria.
There is no legal duty for a woman to disclose her pregnancy. The report suggested social services would have had an earlier opportunity to intervene had Gordon, a registered sex offender, been required to share details of his partner's pregnancy with the authorities.
The review also suggested better support was needed for parents whose children are taken into care.
No single agency or professional had specific responsibility for supporting the couple when their children were removed, or ""helping them process their likely sense of loss and grief"", the review found.
It suggested the ""successive removal"" of Marten and Gordon's children ""may have reinforced their perception of harm caused by children's social care, making the concealment of Victoria feel subjectively 'rational""'.
Marten, who provided written responses to questions from the panel, said that the impact on parents of having a child removed is not properly understood.
She described seeing her children at a contact centre as ""one of the most painful experiences for a parent to endure"".
More than 1,400 unborn infants were subject to child protection plans (CPPs) on 31 March 2025, while around 3,930 children aged under one were subject to CPPs on the same date, the report said.
The review said agencies such as health and housing authorities needed to work together more effectively to help women who present a high risk to their children.
Domestic abuse, Gordon's criminal past, and the parent's refusal to engage with authorities, as well as multiple moves around the country, were among the challenges the authorities faced in protecting the couple's children.
A press release published by the panel said better communication with Marten and Gordon, as well as ""earlier coordinated action"" from the authorities, ""might have made a difference"" in baby Victoria's case.
Other recommendations from the review include:
Clearer national safeguarding guidance that explicitly includes vulnerable unborn babies and infants
The introduction of specific protocols for responding to concealed or late‑disclosed pregnancies
A ""trauma-informed"" approach to families who do not engage with the authorities, recognising the avoidance of social services is not always ""deliberate"" and ""often reflects grief and mistrust""
Improved information-sharing when families move around the country

I died for 40 minutes - here's what it taught me about life,2026-02-12T00:06:28.771Z," Alex Taylor
","Dying doesn't normally give a person new life - yet that is exactly what happened to Patrick Charnley.
He was a high-flying lawyer, who viewed downtime as ""wasted time"", restlessly pushing himself to success.
But working long hours during the pandemic in 2021, the ultra-fit father-of-two suffered a cardiac arrest aged 39.
What began as an unremarkable evening eating sausage and chips on the sofa ended with him collapsing unconscious.
Triggered by a hereditary condition, his heart stopped. Patrick was clinically dead for 40 minutes. His wife performed CPR, while his daughter and son, then nine and seven, ran to get help.
Paramedics' defibrillation attempts failed. With his life slipping away, they tried adrenaline shots as a ""kind of final roll of the dice"", says Patrick.
They ""shocked and shocked and shocked [me]"", he adds. His wife began to suspect he was lost.
Then suddenly his heart began beating again.
Patrick awoke from his week-long coma a changed man, with a brain injury that affects his sight, memory and stamina.
Unable to work and live as he did before, he feels it's allowed him to be more present in life and relationships.
It's a perspective shift, he tells Emma Barnett's Ready to Talk podcast, that he ""wouldn't change"" - even if given the chance to return to his old life.
Still the journey to today's acceptance has been deeply traumatic.
""I woke up blind,"" says Patrick of his first waking memory. ""I was experiencing these things, but not really connecting with them.""
The loss of his eyesight sparked vivid hallucinations. Known as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, the phenomenon is the brain's way of ""filling in"" sudden missing visual data.
While some of these were ""frightening"" he says others felt ""great"" and strangely beautiful.
In one, after his open heart surgery, he became convinced an American nurse was trying to murder him.
But these hallucinations could also provide calm. One took him to a sanitorium in the Alps, where he looked out across the snowy mountains while nurses chatted next door. The experience gave him a ""blissful"" sense of safety.
As his vision slowly returned, doctors realised his sight issues were linked to a brain injury. His eyesight remains partially impaired, comparable to ""looking through a telescope"".
Initial cognitive tests put him in the bottom 2% across memory and processing speed. Although vastly improved, he still has significant cognitive problems.
But the full impact of his injuries only became apparent once he returned home.
Severe fatigue means he has to budget his energy. ""I never, ever wake up feeling refreshed. I wake up exhausted every day, and it gets worse as the day goes on,"" he explains.
There have also been mental changes to adjust to. Patrick found he ""didn't care about anything"" after his initial recovery. This wasn't depression per se, but a condition known as pathological apathy that Patrick describes as feeling like ""floating through time"" without solid ground.

Therapy and medication have helped to revive his motivation, with a psychologist encouraging him to grieve the life he'd lost. Still, Patrick says he misses the spontaneity of life, and fitting in with people his age by ""participating in society"" as expected, as well as actively playing with his children.
He also feels regret for his wife, who he feels he's ""outsourced"" his memory to. ""The truth is that she is my carer, really,"" he admits.
""I sort of live as if I'm really very, very old.""
Despite the vast changes, Patrick says in many ways he prefers this life. He has changed careers to become an author and says he now has more time to enjoy life.
""I live life slowly now, not by choice, but because I have to. But I really appreciate that. I do see the beauty in things much more than I used to… I feel like I live a much richer existence by being slower,"" he says.
""My perspective has fundamentally altered. I feel grateful to be alive"".
His relationship with his family has also changed for the better.
He is able to laugh at the quirks of his condition with them. ""I think we're more solid than ever, really… we have a much closer bond because of what's happened,"" he adds.
""The most important thing to me has always been my family, but now I am able to give so much more of myself to it. Before I was living almost on the surface of it,"" he says.
Patrick's unique situation has allowed him to break free of the daily work grind.
""So many people feel like that… I'm too busy to live my life. I wouldn't change what happened.
""Even with the limitations, I like my life now. I like being home when the children come home from school. I like not rushing from one thing to the next.""

"Andrew should be interviewed by police, former PM Gordon Brown says",2026-02-11T22:09:41.868Z," Hafsa Khalil
","The Metropolitan Police should interview Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and ""urgently"" re-examine its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's victims possibly being trafficked in and out of the UK, former prime minister Gordon Brown has said.
In December, a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to the convicted sex offender had arrived or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018, some with British women on board who say they were abused by Epstein.
The scale of trafficking would ""become apparent"" if an investigation had been conducted into the flights, Brown wrote in the New Statesman.
The BBC has approached Andrew for comment to Brown's article. He has previously denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein.
Brown said he had spent the last week looking at the Epstein files, the documents relating to the disgraced financier released by the US Department of Justice.
""What I discovered about the abuse of women by male predators and their enablers - and Britain's as yet unacknowledged role - has shocked me to the core,"" he said.
""It demands an in-depth police investigation, and is by far the biggest scandal of all.""
Referring to the BBC investigation into Epstein's private planes arriving and departing from UK airports, he wrote that women ""were transferred from one Epstein plane to another"".
A number of logs for his planes identified women on board only as unnamed ""females"".
""It seems the authorities never knew what was happening,"" he said, adding that many of the male passengers are unknown because their names were withheld.
""In short, British authorities had little or no idea who was being trafficked through our country, and for whom other than Epstein.""
Brown adds: ""I have asked the Met urgently to re-examine their decision-making in their investigation and the subsequent reviews.
""Even women who have been mentioned in the Epstein files, whose names should have been requested months ago from the US Department of Justice, do not appear to have been contacted by British investigators.""
""I have been told privately that the investigations related to the former Prince Andrew did not properly check vital evidence of flights.
""I have asked the police to look at this as part of the new inquiry.""
He added that Stansted Airport was one of the airports ""where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another"".
""The Stansted revelations alone require them to interview Andrew,"" Brown said.
Last year, US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein's victims told the BBC it was ""shocking"" that there has never been a ""full-scale UK investigation"" into his activities on the other side of the Atlantic.
One of the British woman who testified against Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell - who is known as Kate - was listed as having been on more than 10 flights paid for by Epstein in and out of the UK between 1999 and 2006.
Her lawyer Brad Edwards told the BBC she has never been contacted by UK police.
""A UK police investigation into Kate's plight could reveal Epstein's enablers in Britain, and might also discover whether his friends protected him from a UK investigation,"" Brown said.
On Wednesday, police in the UK said they were continuing to assess allegations of Epstein having sent a second woman to the UK for sex with Andrew in Windsor in 2010.
""We are assessing the information and following established procedures to seek further information with law enforcement partners in the United States,"" a Thames Valley Police spokesperson said.
Stansted Airport said all private aircraft use entirely independent terminals not operated by Stansted, and the airport does not manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft.

"Brief sent by Andrew to Epstein included gold investments, file seen by BBC suggests",2026-02-11T18:13:59.662Z," Sean Coughlan
Royal correspondentandJames Landale
Diplomatic correspondent
","A document apparently sent by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to Jeffrey Epstein included information on investment opportunities in gold and uranium in Afghanistan.
The BBC has seen a briefing, prepared for Andrew by UK officials when he was a trade envoy, which he forwarded to the convicted sex offender in December 2010 and includes a list of ""high value commercial opportunities"" in Helmand province.
This comes after the BBC reported that the former prince had called the document ""confidential,"" according to an email in the latest tranche of Epstein files.
Andrew has been approached for comment but has yet to respond. Previously he has strongly denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein and rejected any suggestion he used his time as trade envoy to further his own interests.
Sir Vince Cable, who was business secretary at the time, described sharing the briefing as ""appalling behaviour"".
Thames Valley Police are already assessing whether to investigate the apparent sharing of documents related to Andrew's time as trade envoy.
In a new statement on Wednesday, police said: ""We can confirm today that Thames Valley Police is leading the ongoing assessment of allegations relating to misconduct in public office.
""As part of this assessment, we have engaged in discussions with Specialist Crown Prosecutors from the CPS. We will provide updates as and when they are available, but at this stage it would be inappropriate to discuss further specifics of this work.
""During an assessment phase, information is evaluated to determine whether a criminal offence is suspected and whether a full investigation is required. Allegations of misconduct in public office involve particular complexities, and therefore an assessment must be conducted carefully and thoroughly.""
As well as the Afghan document, Andrew also seems to have sent the disgraced financier official reports from his visits as a trade envoy to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam, according to emails in the Epstein files seen by the BBC.
Emails in the files raise the possibility Andrew shared further trade documents with Epstein. One message indicates that a few seconds after sending the reports from the South East Asia visits, the former prince then sent a second batch of files called ""Overseas bids"".
These seem to be ""Zip files"" that usually contain many compressed pieces of information.
The Afghan document, which is in the Epstein files, was compiled by UK government officials specifically for the then Duke of York.
It provides an extensive overview of investment opportunities in Helmand province, at a time when the UK was militarily and politically committed to rebuilding Afghanistan.
As Andrew said in his note to Epstein, it's a ""confidential brief produced by the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand Province"".
It was a briefing produced for Andrew - who was trade envoy between 2001 and 2011 - in the same month that he visited Helmand, where he saw UK troops based there.
It gives an assessment of the current local economy and the business opportunities, including ""significant high value mineral deposits"" and the ""potential for low cost extraction"".
This includes valuable natural resources such as marble, gold, iridium, uranium and thorium and also possible deposits of oil and gas, with the information prepared by UK government officials, working for the Helmand reconstruction team.
According to official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.

Sir Vince, who was seen as instrumental in ending Andrew's time as trade envoy, called for more transparency on Andrew's time as trade envoy.
""I have twice in the past asked to see the file on Andrew as trade envoy and, strangely, it is empty,"" he said.
""I met Andrew once as secretary of state, when I was invited to Buckingham Palace and he was asking me to find something useful for him to do. I didn't.
""Shortly after, in 2011, the first publicity appeared about his friend Epstein and I discontinued the envoy role,"" said Sir Vince.
The role of trade envoy is to promote the UK's business interests overseas and to encourage investment.
Speaking anonymously, a diplomatic source suggested that an envoy such as Andrew might legitimately have shared information with potential investors, encouraging them to support UK international business initiatives, which might have included in Afghanistan.
Andrew's apparent note to Epstein says he is going to ""offer this elsewhere in my network (including Abu Dhabi)"".
On the wider principle of sharing documents, a former senior trade official said many of the reports seen by a trade envoy would have been quite ""pedestrian"", but sometimes the former Duke of York had ""really important meetings with really important people"" that produced real commercial opportunities.
""So it is always possible that there were significant commercial things in the documents which would have been useful,"" the former official said.
""They were absolutely not for sending outside government and particularly not to somebody who might seek to use them for commercial purposes. This was certainly not something a trade envoy could possibly do and justify in any way.""
The former prince continues to be dogged by his links to Epstein after the latest tranche of documents released by the US government included pictures of Mountbatten-Windsor, fully clothed, kneeling on all fours over a woman lying on the ground.
He is facing growing pressure to testify in the US about his links to Epstein and last week moved from his Windsor home to the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.
On Monday a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was ready to support the police as they consider allegations against his brother.

Would you pay £7.50 for a pint of Guinness?,2026-02-11T17:04:36.128Z," Simon Spark
in BartonandSarah-May Buccieri
East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire
","A pub landlord is asking customers if they would be happy paying £7.50 for a pint of Guinness.
The Advocate Arms in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, currently charges £6 but said it was considering a price increase due to a ""significant rise"" from the brand.
Landlord Matthew Horsfield said: ""We wanted to see what customers thought and what they would like to see, and weigh up our options.""
Diageo, the distributors for Guinness, said it had kept price increases to a minimum, reflecting the rising costs in the supply chain and said retail pricing was ""entirely at the discretion of the retailer/wholesaler"".
Horsfield, 42, added: ""Guinness seems to be one of the major brands that just keeps increasing prices yearly.
""It starts from the top, so your suppliers get those increases and then it gets fed all the way to us.
""It's really frustrating. You're constantly trying to weigh it up and balance it out. It's a lot of money for a pint at any pub nowadays.""
Diageo said Guinness was priced very competitively in the marketplace, with the average cost in the UK being £5.21 a pint.
Following the increase, due to take effect in April, it said the impact per draught pint for customers would be approximately £0.04.
The company added: ""Like all businesses, Diageo must carefully manage the rising cost of doing business through regular pricing review of our products.
""This increase allows Diageo to continue investing in our brands to bring high-quality stout and spirits to market, and to support investment in initiatives to drive mutual growth for our customers across the hospitality sector.""
Data from The Office for National Statistics shows that in 1987, the average price of a pint of draught lager was under £1, by 2000 it had risen to £2, and by 2025 it was £4.83.
In January, the government announced pubs and music venues in England would be given a 15% discount on their business rates from April after a backlash against November's Budget.
Ash Corbett-Collins, chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale, said pubs were facing a ""gigantic fight every day to keep their doors open"".
""The ever-increasing price of a pint means supporting your local is becoming unaffordable for many pubgoers, but for publicans the only choice is to raise prices or close their doors for good,"" he said.
Corbett-Collins said urgent government action was needed.
""They [landlords] must be given support with unrelenting energy bills, increases to National Insurance contributions must be reversed; VAT on food and drink, as well as duty charged on pints in pubs, must be lowered,"" he added.
""Pubs desperately need permanently lower business rate bills if they are to thrive, not just survive.""
Heather Dempsey, director of Shadowbridge Brewery in Scunthorpe, has set a limit of £5 for drinks, meaning some brands are not stocked.
""We can't justify it,"" she said. ""At the prices we would have to buy them we'd have to sell them at maybe £7 a pint - possibly more.
""This would mean we would sell less of it and, therefore, we would waste more because it's not selling. It's a bit of a vicious cycle, really.""
The BBC asked people in Barton, North Lincolnshire, which has a number of pubs, how much they would pay for a pint and whether £7.50 was too much.
Josh Kelly, 26, said: ""You see a lot of IPAs that are priced at £6.50 to £7.
""I wouldn't want to pay more than £5.50, maybe £6 depending on what you're drinking.""
Meanwhile, Carol Jacklin said: ""I am totally shocked, no wonder pubs are closing.""
Reverend Kathy Colwell added: ""That's an extortionate amount for a drink, but then everything has gone up, hasn't it?""
James Toomey, 81, said £4.50 and above would be too much to pay for a pint.

Why did a sick turtle wash-up on a beach?,2026-02-11T12:17:35.027Z," Ros Tappenden
South of EnglandandAnjana Gadjil
Weymouth
","A rare loggerhead turtle has spent its first night at a sea life centre in Dorset after being rescued from a beach in Jersey.
The dog walker who found it washed up on 19 January initially thought it was dead but called for help after seeing it move.
Named Crush by its rescuers, the turtle has had an unusual few weeks, including a fortnight's stay in a vet's family home and a ""celebrity trip"" on an aircraft to Southampton.
The hope is for Crush to eventually be released back into warmer seas, but not before the months-long process of restoring her core temperature and strength.
Peter Hawarth, clinical director at New Era Veterinary Hospital in Jersey, explained Crush was ""cold-stunned"" - a hypothermia-like condition that causes the turtle's body to shut down - and at the time she was found, her core temperature was just 10C (50F).
He said: ""We had to warm the turtle up very, very slowly... two to three degrees per day, so to start with we had to do everything outside.
""When they are cold-stunned they get a lot of toxins build up in the tissue and, if you warm them up too suddenly, all those toxins flood into the rest of the organs and cause shutdown.""
He said once Crush's body temperature reached 22C ""she could eat, drink, poo and do everything a turtle would do"".
Although the New Era team had rescued a cold-stunned turtle before, it had been 10 years ago, so they received expert advice from British Divers Marine Life Rescue, Sea Life and even Rotterdam Zoo.
Jade Cranfield, senior aquarist at Weymouth Sea Life in Dorset, said the Jersey animal hospital ""did a really great job"".
She said: ""The first thing we do [with cold-stunned turtles] is put them in a container with a foam mattress that's got the water level coming up, just enough so it's damp, to warm her up a little bit.
""Blood tests are done and X-rays are done to find out what our next steps are going to be because they're often dehydrated as well.""
Sure enough, Crush's core temperature started to rise but after a week at the animal hospital, she needed a bigger tank.
Hawarth said: ""We had to put something together in a room at my house so she has been lodging with us for two weeks.
""I was having to move 500l (110 gallons) of saltwater every two or three days.
""I was boiling seawater, tipping it in to get it to the right temperature, so she could go back into that water.""
At Weymouth's Sea Life Centre, seawater is pumped directly into tanks and heated to the correct temperature.
Crush spent her first night in a 2,000-litre (440-gallon) quarantine tank and has eaten some sprats.
She will eventually move to a 17,000-litre (3,740-gallon) tank with another cold-stunned turtle.
Cranfield said: ""There's a lot that have been washed up recently around the UK so we are hoping to get them all up to health so we can release them in a warmer climate, where they should be, at the end of spring.""
Loggerhead turtles can be found in the subtropical waters off north Africa and it is believed Crush was swept north by storms and currents.
Others have been found in Sussex, Suffolk and as far north as Tyree in Scotland.
The species is classed as ""vulnerable"" on the IUCN Red List. There are an estimated 2,000 breeding females worldwide and out of every 1,000 hatchlings, on average, only one makes it to adulthood.
It is not known if Crush is female but rescuers have called her ""she"" because, like other females, she has a larger tail.
Hawarth described the plane journey to Southampton as ""a little bit stressful"" with Crush ""rattling the box the entire way over"" but said carrier Logan Air had provided them with a ""celebrity trip"".
After they arrived in Weymouth, he said: ""I'm going to miss her. She has a personality, she has a temper.
""My daughter fell in love with her immediately. It's going to be sad.
""Putting her into that bigger tank was a wonderful experience.
""I just can't wait to see her get released in the coming months.""

More than 180 survivors engaged in Harrods abuse redress scheme,2026-02-11T12:12:45.044Z," Ellie Price
News correspondent
","More than 180 survivors of abuse by the former Harrods owner Mohammed Al Fayed are currently ""engaged"" in its compensation scheme, the company has said.
The luxury retailer said it has already paid out compensation to more than 50 women.
The scheme, which was opened last March, will close to new submissions on 31 March.
In October, Harrods said it had set aside more than £60m in its plan to compensate victims of alleged historical abuse.
Under the compensation scheme, claimants can apply for general damages of up to £200,000, though victims who agree to be assessed by a consultant psychiatrist could receive up to £385,000 in compensation plus treatment costs.
Survivors who are not assessed by a psychiatrist will receive lower payments.
Applications submitted by 31 March will continue to be processed after that deadline.
The department store also said it will continue offering counselling support after the deadline, including from its Independent Survivor Advocate.
Human rights campaigner Dame Jasvinder Sanghera was appointed by Harrods for the Advocate role in 2024, promising to meet as many survivors as possible and guide them through the retailer's compensation process.
Justice for Harrods Survivors, which represents some victims, said only a ""truly independent"" process could address the needs of survivors.
Multiple women have accused Al Fayed, who owned the luxury store between 1985 to 2010, of rape and sexual assault. The Met Police said that 146 people have come forward to report a crime in their investigation into Al Fayed.
As well as its flagship store in Knightsbridge, London, the Harrods Group operates smaller stores at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as a small chain of beauty stores.
KP Law, who represents more than 260 survivors, has been critical of the Redress Scheme citing concerns Harrods retain ""complete control"" of the scheme.
Tom Fletcher, a specialist lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which is supporting some victims, said it is pleased to have secured settlements for some of the firm's clients.
He said: ""Whilst no amount of money will ever be enough, the amounts of compensation recovered under the scheme recognises the significance of the abuse our clients went through while also allowing them funds to access the specialist support they require to try and move forward with their lives the best they can.""
Correction 13 February: This story has been updated to clarify that claimants can apply for up to £200,000 in general damages, rather than each receiving £200,000

Ferry terminal's £72m budget 'exhausted',2026-02-11T06:33:21.769Z," Catherine Nicoll
Isle of Man
","The final cost of an Isle of Man government-funded ferry port in Liverpool still cannot be revealed but the £72,976,000 earmarked for it has been ""exhausted"", the infrastructure minister has said.
Tim Crookall said the cost of the terminal at the Prince's Half-Tide Dock to the public purse was still subject to a legal dispute with contractors.
Lawrie Hooper – a former member of the department - challenged the minister to confirm the final figure was ""north of a £100m"" and the negotiations were about the ""recovery"" of funds already paid.
Crookall confirmed the negotiations were about getting money back from the contractors, and he had received legal advice not to reveal the total project cost.
The ferry port at the Prince's Half-Tide Dock in Liverpool opened to passengers in June 2024, years later than originally planned after a raft of delays.
Those hold-ups, which included difficulties caused by the Covid pandemic, saw the cost of the project almost double from £38m to £70.6m, but a bid to allocate an additional £10m in contingency funding was withdrawn in November 2023.
Crookall told the House of Keys: ""The department has concluded the construction contract with the main contractor and the final account has now been closed.
""I can confirm that the department is working closely with its legal advisors to resolve the ongoing disputes so I am unable to release the final figure for the construction of the Isle of Man Ferry Terminal Liverpool at this time.""
Hooper argued that the structure of the contract meant ""all the money has already been paid out"".
""The reality is now we are working back from a theoretical maximum cost backwards towards what the actual final settlement will be,"" he said, ""and the minister is perfectly at liberty to disclose what that final paid out amount is.""
""That actually isn't going to change, being as it is money that has already been physically handed over to the contractor.""
But Crookall maintained that, having taken legal advice, he could not reveal the figure until the dispute had been concluded.
""I can, however, confirm that £70.676m in the pink book [Isle of Man Budget] plus £2.12m from the capital inflation budget line has been exhausted,"" he said.
Following on from the legal process, he said a supplementary vote would be sought in Tynwald to cover the funding needed above that already allocated.
Crookall told politicians the negotiations would likely be ongoing for ""at least for another year if not 18 months, maybe longer"".

Teen had to tell deaf mum her dad might die,2026-02-11T06:24:06.140Z," Aida Fofana
West Midlands
","Hospital staff asked a teenage boy to tell his deaf mother that her father might die, according to the findings of an ombudsman.
The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman said University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Trust failed to follow national guidance, by repeatedly using children to interpret critical medical information for their deaf family members.
Alan Graham, who was born deaf and used British Sign Language (BSL) as his first language, died in September 2021 after being treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
His daughter, Jennifer Petty, who is also deaf, complained about her father's care. The NHS trust apologised adding ""we did not get things right"".
The 52-year-old also raised the issue of hospital staff using her children as interpreters.
The investigation by the ombudsman found the concerns she raised caused significant distress and affected the family's ability to grieve.
The ombudsman investigates complaints about government departments, other public organisations and the NHS in England.
Their inquiry discovered clinicians asked Petty's son, who was 16 at the time, to explain that his grandfather might not survive the night and CPR should not be attempted if his condition worsened.
The 75-year-old died the following day.
During an 11-week period in hospital, professional BSL interpreters were provided on only three occasions, the ombudsman found.
Instead staff regularly relied on Petty's son and daughter, who was 12, to translate complex medical information, including details about the 75-year-old's condition.
The 52-year-old said the situation was deeply upsetting for the whole family and it was ""totally unacceptable"" that her children were placed in the position of delivering bad news about their grandfather's condition.
""My children just wanted to visit their grandad and be there for him as family members but they were constantly being asked to translate by the staff,"" she said.
""Having to deliver the bad news about my dad's prognosis was extremely upsetting for all of us.""
The ombudsman said the trust did not consistently make reasonable adjustments for a deaf patient and his family, despite clear requirements set out in national guidance.
Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, chief executive of the ombudsman, said public services must be accessible to everyone.
She said deaf patients and their families should not face extra barriers when getting healthcare.
By failing to provide BSL interpreters consistently, the trust caused unnecessary distress in the weeks before Graham's death, she added, and NHS leaders needed to learn from the case.
The former furniture maker and keen fisherman, originally from Dundee, had moved to Birmingham to be closer to his grandchildren.
He was first admitted to hospital in June 2021 following a fall and was diagnosed with heart failure.
But, after being discharged in August, he was readmitted the following month with similar symptoms and died two weeks later.
The ombudsman found that the lack of interpreters did not affect the medical treatment he received but did cause worry and stress to his family and limited his daughter's ability to communicate with clinicians.
The trust was told to draw up an action plan, apologise to the family and make compensation payments of £900 to each grandchild and £750 to their mum.
A spokesperson for UHB said: ""We offer our sincere apologies to [the family] for their experience, at what was a very difficult time for them.
""We recognise that we did not get things right and understand the impact this had on them.""
Since 2021, actions have been introduced to help deaf patients, including strengthening awareness and accessibility arrangements to ensure patients' communication needs are better met, they added.

Islands' business leaders seek closer collaboration,2026-02-11T06:08:34.914Z," Georgina Barnes
Jersey
","Business leaders have called for the Channel Islands' politicians and organisations to work more closely together to address joint issues.
They were speaking at an event in St Helier, organised by Jersey's Chambers of Commerce.
Those in attendance considered how the islands could boost collaboration, enhance their economies, and reduce public spending.
Jersey's Minister for Sustainable Economic Development Deputy Kirsten Morel, who addressed the meeting, said the Channel Islands' authorities ""should"" commit to more joint projects, while also being prepared to speak up when ""the interests don't align"".
The executive director of Guernsey's Chamber of Commerce, Alice Gill, said each island spent about 30% of its annual budget on health, and working together could benefit taxpayers.
She said business communities in both islands were also seeking closer cross-collaboration.
""I think people forget some of the positive things that we are working together, so external relations, cybersecurity, we're already importing electricity together from France,"" she said.
""There's a huge amount that we are doing but there's always room for improvement.
""I think businesses want to see a move of some of the friction of doing business across the island - so is that around skills?
""Is it around people? Is it around aligning some of our rules and legislation?
""Some of the stuff that adds, you know, time and effort - where you've got to do it twice - what can we do to smooth that over, that makes it an easier place to do business?""
Lee Madden, president of Jersey's Chamber of Commerce, said ""historically"" there had always been ""an intent for the islands to work together"".
He said: ""I think governments have worked well together in the past on some projects and not so well on other projects.
""As the joint chambers, we feel that by coming together we can set an example, shine a light for how working together can really benefit both islands.""
He added: ""Good communication and openness creates trust, and with trust, we can create momentum, and with the momentum we can do things better and maybe drive more economic benefits to both islands.""
Morel added the islands were ""competitors"" but ""friends as well"".
""Of course we can work together,"" he said.
""Everything from the Channel Islands Lottery to the financial services ombudsman to telecom security - we are working together.
""We should do that more. But when the interests don't align, as I think happened with the ferries, we need to say, 'actually, this isn't going to work'.""

Spike in antisemitism reports after synagogue attack,2026-02-11T00:10:17.350Z," Natasha PreskeyandJonny Humphries
North West
","Reports of antisemitism incidents in the UK spiked after the deadly Manchester synagogue attack last year.
The volunteer-run Community Security Trust (CST), which provides security and monitors antisemitism in the UK, said 40 incidents were recorded on the day of the attack and 40 the day after - the highest daily totals of 2025.
Worshippers Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby died on 2 October after Jihad Al-Shamie drove into the gates of the Heaton Park Synagogue in Manchester and began attacking with a knife, while wearing a fake suicide belt. Police later said that one of the victims died from a gunshot fired by police.
The CST said more than half of the incidents it recorded across both days involved direct reactions to the attack, including celebrating it.
Of these 42 incidents, three involved ""face-to-face taunting and celebration of the attack to Jewish people"", and 39 took place online. These included antisemitic social media posts referencing the attack, abusive responses to public condemnations of the attack from Jewish organisations and individuals, or antagonistic emails sent to Jewish people and institutions.
The killings in Manchester were the first fatal antisemitic terror attack in the UK since the CST began recording incidents in 1984.
According to the CST report, there were 3,700 anti-Jewish hate incidents recorded in 2025, up 4% from 3,556 in 2024. Last year saw the second highest annual total ever, second only to 2023 when there were 4,298.
The total for 2023 included 416 incidents in the week following Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel - a larger number than any subsequent week.
Though 2023 saw the highest total number of incidents, last year was the first time more than 200 cases of anti-Jewish hate were recorded in every calendar month.
Last year also saw the highest ever recorded number of cases of damage and desecration to Jewish property - including damage to the homes and vehicles of Jewish people and to synagogues.
There were 217 such incidents in 2025, up 38% from 157 in 2024.
CST chief executive Mark Gardner described the attack in Manchester as the culmination of ""two years of intense anti-Jewish hatred"".
He said: ""The terror attack then triggered even more antisemitism, showing the depths of extremism faced by Jews and all our British society.""
Chief Constable Mark Hobrough, the national policing lead for hate crime, said 2025 had seen ""unacceptably high"" levels of antisemitic hate.
He added: ""The tensions that exist in our society have not abated and are both deeper and more long-standing than anything we have experienced in modern times.""
The CST said there was also a spike in reports on the day of the Bondi Beach killings in Sydney in December, and on the two following days.
Of the 50 incidents across those three days, just under half (21) directly referenced the Bondi attack, the CST said.

Lord John Mann, the government's independent adviser on antisemitism, said it was ""particularly troubling"" to see the large number of incidents that had taken place immediately after the Manchester attack.
Overall, he said the latest figures were ""deeply alarming and illustrate the unrelenting nature of antisemitism in our country today"".
Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the latest numbers were ""shocking"" and the government ""stands against the scourge of antisemitism"".
She added: ""We are providing record funding for security at synagogues, Jewish schools and community centres. I will go further to strengthen police powers so they can crack down on intimidating protests.""
Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said while the figures were ""appalling"" they were ""not a surprise"" and said the ""evil of antisemitism"" must be called out.
He added: ""Anyone espousing extremist views or who expresses support for terrorism, or racial or religious hatred of any kind, including antisemitism, who is not a British citizen, should be removed from this country.""
Clarification 17 February : This article was amended to make clear that one of the victims, Adrian Daulby, died after being struck by police gunfire.

Flights from St Helena island grounded by airport safety concerns,2026-02-10T20:38:08.786Z," Andrée Massiah
","The only airport on the island of St Helena, a remote British overseas territory in the Atlantic Ocean, has been closed over fire safety concerns.
A major incident has been declared by the local government after checks found the airport's fire engines failed to meet international safety standards, forcing it to halt operations.
The airport is the primary route in and out of the island, which lies 1,200 miles (1,900km) off the south-west African coast and is home to around 4,000 people.
While some small aircraft, such as for medical evacuations, are permitted to fly, officials say passenger flights will be cancelled ""until at least 20 February"".
The UK government has been alerted to the situation and a specialist team has been set up on the island to work towards reopening the airport.
Stephen Doughty, the Foreign Office minister of state for Europe, North America and Overseas Territories, is in contact with St Helena's chief minister.
The Foreign Office has also updated its travel advice for the island.
But with journeys by sea taking several days, residents now find themselves stuck and unable to fly to and from St Helena, and tourists face additional costs for food and accommodation.
The UK-funded airport opened in 2016 but has been beset by problems, leading a review by MPs the same year to find that British taxpayers had been ""unquestionably failed"" by the £285m development.
Commercial flights have previously been hampered by wind conditions and the facility was labelled a ""white elephant"" by the Public Accounts Committee.
At a press conference, the island's governor Nigel Phillips said: ""The airport fire engines have each developed faults. This degrades the level of fire cover that can be provided.""
He went on to say that there was ""insufficient fire suppressant that could be put onto an aircraft if needed"".
In a later statement issued on 10 February, the St Helena government said ""restoring the airport"" to a condition to accept commercial flights ""remains our highest priority"".
It said specialised spare parts are currently en route from Germany to enable repairs and ""with the potential support of the UK government"" it was seeking two new fire appliances for the airport.
With a landmass of 47 sq miles (121 sq km), St Helena is about the same size as Jersey in the Channel Islands.
The incident could impact businesses and tourism, which has become a focus of the local economy since the airport was built.
Upcoming events on the island include what has been dubbed the world's most remote marathon on 22 February.
The government has advised people affected to contact their airlines and travel insurers.
BBC News has spoken to some of those impacted by the closure.
Hugh, who lives in Gloucestershire, flew to St Helena with his girlfriend in January for three weeks to visit family but does not know when they can return to the UK.
He said: ""We are due to leave here on 15 February to fly to Johannesburg and then on to the UK.
""I haven't heard anything from Airlink or British Airways about our flights yet.
""We can't make alternative bookings as we don't know when the airport will reopen.""
Hugh said he is stressed about the unknown and is worried about the extra money he has to find.
He continued: ""New flights could cost us £3,000 and we're looking at extending our travel insurance that will cost £90 for 45 days or £190 for over that. And also there is the accommodation in Johannesburg.
""We used up most of our leave to come here and now we might have to take unpaid leave.
""We have a mortgage to pay at home and with the cost of living, it's all a lot of money.""
Cheryl Tingler, who lives in Florida with her husband Joe, found out about the airport closure on the day of their arrival in Cape Town, South Africa, from where they planned to travel onwards to St Helena to return her father's ashes.
She said: ""As soon as we got to the hotel, we heard the news from my friend.
""We planned the trip for my dad who died of prostate cancer in 2024.
""He was able to live with us in the US for the last year of his life.
""Out of respect for his wishes we planned to bring his ashes back home to St Helena.""
Cheryl said they are waiting for news about accommodation, adding: ""The travel agency said that they will help us to get accommodation in Cape Town, but we are due to check out tomorrow morning [Tuesday].
""We are retired and we hope to stay in St Helena until May but it is an anxious time.""
Meanwhile, Melissa and Nigel James from Northamptonshire were due to fly back to the UK on Tuesday but have to stay in St Helena until the airport reopens.
Their son Ryan said his parents had seen their travel plans cancelled due to the closure and ""do not have the financial means to cover an extended and unplanned stay on the island, nor to fund replacement flights once the airport eventually reopens"".
He continued: ""Accommodation and day-to-day living costs continue to add up, and there is considerable uncertainty about how long the situation may last.
""They are self-employed back home and will lose money by not being able to get back to the UK to work.
""My mum has been on the phone to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London to get more information.
""The local authorities are doing what they can to manage the situation - my parents have been given £20 food vouchers.
""A number of visitors are now in similar circumstances, facing prolonged disruption with little clarity about onward travel options.""

Former Daily Mail editor tells hacking trial allegations are 'preposterous',2026-02-10T19:30:14.084Z," Nick Johnson
Bruce ThainandImogen James
","Former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has told the High Court he ""utterly refutes"" the ""preposterous"" allegations of unlawful newsgathering at the paper.
Seven people, including Prince Harry and Sir Elton John, are suing Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) - publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday - for ""grave breaches of privacy"".
Dacre is the current editor-in-chief of DMG Media Ltd, the holding company of ANL, which denies all allegations of unlawful information gathering.
He told the court he was ""angry and upset"" for his staff at the newspapers as the allegations had ""cast a dark shadow over their lives for the past three years"".
Dacre previously defended the actions of Associated Newspapers at the Leveson Inquiry into press standards 14 years ago. There, he answered questions about the paper's use of private investigators to obtain information.
On Tuesday Dacre was back in court, facing similar questions from the same barrister, David Sherborne, who is representing the seven claimants.
Dacre told the trial that he ""wasn't aware"" of the extent of the paper's use of private investigators - who he referred to as ""inquiry agents"" - until around 2007 when he ""brought the shutters down"".
Sherborne asked Dacre whether his involvement in the case ""is motivated by a desire to protect your legacy"" rather than getting a fair outcome. Dacre admitted wanting to clear his name, but also said he cared about the ""honest and dedicated"" staff at the paper.
Regarding allegations that hacking and tapping phones was ""habitual and widespread"" at the Daily Mail, Dacre said: ""I utterly reject this. Such blatant illegality would not, I believe, have been countenanced at any level on the paper I edited.""
He added that he is sure if he was told there was evidence a journalist or agent had blagged information, he would ""have been pretty furious"".
The ""sometimes preposterous allegations"" have ""in the small hours of the night – reduced me to rage"" he wrote in his witness statement, adding that they have had a ""deeply upsetting and, in some instances, traumatic impact"" on past and present Daily Mail staff.
Another of the claimants, Baroness Lawrence, is the mother of the murdered black schoolboy Stephen Lawrence. When Stephen was murdered, the Daily Mail campaigned on her behalf.
In her claim, Lawrence alleges that ANL targeted her with hidden electronic surveillance, tapped her phone and monitored her bank account.
She previously told the court that she felt like ""a victim all over again"" after she learned of the allegations.
Dacre told the court on Tuesday that ""my heart bleeds for Doreen Lawrence""
In his statement he added Lawrence's claims in relation to the campaign ""are especially bewildering and bitterly wounding to me personally.""
At times, the atmosphere between Sherborne and Dacre was combative.
At one stage, Sherborne suggested ""you choose to remember the things that might be helpful, and deliberately forget the things that might be unhelpful"".
Right at the end of the day, Mr Justice Nicklin scolded Sherborne and said he was treating his questioning like a public inquiry. ""I don't consider the large bulk of questions to have any real relevance to the issues I have to decide,"" he added.
Dacre will return to the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday to continue giving evidence.
The trial before Mr Justice Nicklin is due to conclude in March. A written judgment is expected to be issued at a later date.

Cargo ship towed to shore after engine room fire,2026-02-10T19:30:04.106Z," Stuart Rust
South of England
","A cargo ship has been towed into port after a fire broke out in its engine room while it was off the Isle of Wight.
HM Coastguard earlier said the Caesarea Trader would be checked and then towed into Portsmouth where fire crews would take over the incident.
The blaze on the vessel broke out at about 15:45 GMT on Monday when it was east of Shanklin. The situation was reported as stable by about 22:00 and all 24 people on board were accounted for and safe.
In a statement, the Marine Accident Investigation Branch said its team would examine the vessel when it arrived in port.
The vessel, owned by DFDS, transports freight between the Channel Islands and Portsmouth.
The coastguard search and rescue helicopter was sent to undertake thermal imaging of the vessel after the fire broke out, along with Bembridge RNLI lifeboat and tugs from Portsmouth.
The lifeboat crew was stood down at 20:20 after remaining on scene as a precaution.
The Caesarea Trader - previously named Commodore Goodwill - was reflagged under the UK flag last year.
It has a cargo capacity of 1,250 cubic metres, the equivalent of about 80 trailers.
Operator DFDS said it was ""making necessary steps to maintain continuity of freight links to Jersey"".
Food supply to Jersey should be ""minimally disrupted"", according to the island's minister for sustainable economic development.
The ferry served the Channel Islands for nearly 30 years before it was bought by the Danish-based company in 2025.
It was renamed Caesarea Trader in homage to Jersey's Latin name, Caesarea.

Visas for legal migration
Data for total entries via visas only includes those granted. It does not include people coming to the UK on a visitor visa or those on a transit visa - whose final destination is not the UK.
Visa figures do not show if or when an individual arrived in the UK, but marks the point at which they were granted permission to do so.
If someone was granted more than one visa within the year shown, each one is counted separately.
The work category refers to new individuals linked to visas and permits, or the extension of an existing permission. This includes sub-categories such as seasonal, health and care, domestic and youth mobility visas.
Study visas include all sponsored individuals by approved education providers in the UK, and those on short-term study visas.
Family visas lets someone come to the UK or stay longer so they can live with close family members who are already here. It includes joining a spouse, partner, child or parent, or coming to care for a relative.
The Other category refers to miscellaneous visas outside the categories of work, family and study. It includes humanitarian routes such as the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme and the British National Overseas route.
It also includes family permits for people from countries in the European Union or European Economic Area.
Asylum applications and hotels
Figures for asylum seekers in hotels are published by the Home Office under the ""contingency accommodation - hotel"" category.
The number of people in all other forms of accommodation includes those in non-hotel contingency accommodation, plus initial, dispersal and ""other"" accommodation.
A scale is used to determine how close a local authority is from the average share of the population for an area in the UK. It compares the share in that area to the share across all areas in the UK that use that form of accommodation.
Less than half = more than 50% below the average share of the population
Lower than = between 25% to 50% below the average share of the population
About the same as = within 25% of the average share of the population
Higher than = between 25% to 100% above the average share of the population
More than double = more than 100% above the average share of the population
Figures on the backlog of people waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application include both applicants and dependants.
The number of open appeals against refused asylum applications refers to individuals.
Small boat crossings and other illegal arrivals
The figures for small boat crossings and the average number of people per boat are derived from the UK Home Office's daily timeseries.
Entering the UK without permission is an offence under immigration law, but asylum seekers are generally not prosecuted for doing so if they claim asylum on arrival. In some cases, people have been prosecuted for entering the UK without permission alongside other offences, such as people smuggling or re-entering after deportation.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) collects figures for people who died or went missing while crossing from mainland Europe to the UK.
These reports are based on French and UK officials (such as police or coastguard) or media sources, and are considered an undercount by the IOM due to a lack of official statistics.
The figures can include people who died in the Channel while crossing, but also those who died at any point while en route to a crossing point.
Data for modern slavery only includes final decisions. Modern slavery includes any form of human trafficking, slavery, servitude or forced labour.
Figures for other entries without permission are the sum of all irregular arrivals that were not by small boat, including inadequately documented air arrivals, recorded detections at UK ports and other recorded detections in the UK.
Returns and deportations from the UK
Figures on people who come to the UK but are denied entry at that point and then leave the country are not included in the number of returns in this page.
People being returned after being convicted of a criminal offence includes people who are not British citizens who have been convicted in the UK of any criminal offence, or convicted abroad for a serious criminal offence.
Returns involving the government include the Home Office categories of enforced returns (also known as deportations) as well as assisted and controlled voluntary returns.
Independent returns are referred to by the government as other verified returns.
UK migration compared with other countries
Sea arrivals figures are taken from the UNHCR European sea arrivals dashboard and combined with UK Home Office figures for small boat arrivals.
Asylum applications, immigration and emigration figures for European countries is the latest available data from Eurostat for the following countries:
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Norway, Switzerland and Croatia.
Population figures for the UK are from ONS, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency 2024 mid-year estimates, and for Europe from Eurostat data as of 1 January 2024.
In order to account for smaller populations and make European data comparable with the UK, when calculating figures for net migration and asylum applications, European countries with a population of less than one million have been excluded.
Additionally, when calculating net migration, only countries which include asylum seekers or refugees in their immigration figures are included, these are:
Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland.

'Minimal disruption' to food supply after ship fire,2026-02-10T14:21:15.568Z,No Author Listed,"Food supply to Jersey should be ""minimally disrupted"" following a cargo ship fire, according to the minister for sustainable economic development.
HM Coastguard was called on Monday after a fire broke out in the engine room of the Caesarea Trader off the coast of the Isle of Wight. Operator DFDS said all crew members, and the one passenger on board, were safe.
It said the Stena Vinga would operate additional freight-only sailing and back-up vessel, MV Arrow, was set to arrive in Portsmouth on Wednesday, adding: ""We are working with freight customers to finalise a revised operating schedule.""
Deputy Kirsten Morel said: ""There should be a minimal impact on food supplies.""
DFDS said the Caesarea Trader, previously named Commodore Goodwill, was ""safely anchored"" off the Isle of Wight.
The operator said it was working with port authorities to bring the ship into port at an ""appropriate time"".
The 126m (413ft) long ship has a cargo capacity of 1,250 cubic metres, the equivalent of about 80 trailers.
It was renamed Caesarea Trader in homage to Jersey's Latin name, Caesarea.

Turtle lands in UK for rehab after Storm Goretti,2026-02-10T09:45:34.895Z,No Author Listed,"A rare turtle which washed up in Jersey following Storm Goretti has landed in the UK after travelling via plane for rehabilitation.
Crush, a loggerhead turtle, was given treatment at New Era Veterinary Hospital in St Saviour after she was found extremely weak and suffering from malnutrition.
Vets said the turtle could not handle a ferry journey so airline Loganair offered to transport her by plane to Southampton.
Claudine Kirk, from Loganair, said the creature had to be taken to a separate area to be searched ""as we can't put her through the security scanners"".
She added: ""We've got special permissions to take Crush on the actual aircraft... travelling as a pet.
""Loganair just want to make sure we can assist and get Crush back to full health.""
Crush is to continue her rehabilitation in Southampton, where she landed after 07:30 GMT on Tuesday.
From Southampton, Crush is due to be taken to the Sealife centre at Weymouth in Dorset.
Vets believe exposure to cold water in the English Channel resulted in her suffering ""cold stunning"", which causes a turtle's body to shut down.

King 'ready to support' police as they assess Andrew claims over Epstein,2026-02-10T06:36:00.329Z," Sean Coughlan
Royal correspondent
","King Charles has made his first intervention in the latest round of revelations in the Epstein scandal, saying Buckingham Palace is ready to support the police as they consider allegations against his brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
""The King has made clear, in words and through unprecedented actions, his profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's conduct,"" a Palace spokesman said.
""While the specific claims in question are for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police we stand ready to support them as you would expect,"" he said.
Thames Valley Police confirmed it is assessing whether there are grounds to investigate a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic, which reported Mountbatten-Windsor for suspected misconduct in public office and breach of official secrets.
Emails from the recently released batch of Epstein files appear to show the former prince passing on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam and confidential details of investment opportunities.
After the trips, on 30 November 2010, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then-special adviser, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.
There were also details of investment opportunities in Afghanistan, described as ""confidential"", which appear to have been passed on to Epstein on 24 December 2010.
Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.
The Buckingham Palace statement says that the King and Queen's ""thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse"".
Earlier on Monday the King had travelled to Clitheroe where a heckler shouted: ""How long have you known about Andrew?"" The rest of the crowd booed the man putting the question.
The Buckingham Palace intervention follows an earlier statement from the spokesperson for the Prince and Princess of Wales, saying they were ""deeply concerned"" by the latest revelations about Epstein.
""Their thoughts remain focused on the victims,"" said a Kensington Palace spokesperson, ahead of Prince William's visit to Saudi Arabia this week.
Since the release of three million more documents related to Epstein, there has been growing pressure on Mountbatten-Windsor, with claims a second woman was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with him.
Photographs appearing to show him kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground were also included in the latest batch of files.
There has also been embarrassment for his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson. Emails signed ""Sarah"" show appeals for support and money from sex offender Epstein.
Last week, Andrew was moved more quickly than expected from his home at Royal Lodge in Windsor to the King's private estate in Sandringham.
In October 2025, after a previous wave of revelations about his links to Epstein, Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his titles as a prince and a duke.
Andrew has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct.

Mountain deaths of father and son ruled accidental,2026-02-10T06:19:24.676Z," Andy Giddings
West Midlands
","The deaths of a father and son in Glen Coe were accidental, an inquest concluded.
Tom Parry, 49, and his 12-year-old son Richie, from Alsager, Cheshire, were killed in a fall on the mountain Stob Coire Nan Lochan on 29 May 2024.
Coroner Andrew Barkley, at Stoke-on-Trent Coroner's Court, said Richie died from being exposed to cold temperatures which led to hypothermia and his father died as a result of head and chest injuries.
The pair were found after a search involving 44 people, mountain rescue teams and a coastguard helicopter.
The inquest into their deaths heard Richie was found lying in snow about 100m (109yds) from his father and it appeared both had fallen.
They heard the pair set off for Scotland on 26 May and, on 28 May, Tom called his wife to say they were going to climb another mountain.
He told her they expected to get back at around 21:00 BST that night.
They were reported missing to Cheshire Police by Mr Parry's wife the following day, after failing to return home.
Their vehicle and some belongings were found in Three Sisters Car Park, Glen Coe.

Fire breaks out on cargo ship off Isle of Wight,2026-02-09T22:04:35.233Z,No Author Listed,"A fire has broken out in the engine room of a cargo ship off the coast of the Isle of Wight.
HM Coastguard said it was responding to the fire on board the Caesarea Trader at anchor east of Shanklin.
The coastguard search and rescue helicopter was sent to undertake thermal imaging of the vessel, along with Bembridge RNLI lifeboat and tugs from Portsmouth.
Operator DFDS said the fire was under control and all crew members, and the one passenger who was travelling with the vessel, were safe.
It said the 126m (413ft) long ship was ""anchored in a safe location"" off the Isle of Wight.
Ship tracking websites show the vessel in the English Channel about four nautical miles from the coast of the Isle of Wight.
The Caesarea Trader - previously named Commodore Goodwill - was reflagged under the UK flag last year and transports freight between the Channel Islands and Portsmouth.
It is has a cargo capacity of 1,250 cubic metres, the equivalent of about 80 trailers.
DFDS said it was ""making necessary steps to maintain continuity of freight links to Jersey"".

Violinist sent hundreds of nude images to women,2026-02-09T18:55:12.696Z," Nicola Goodwin
BBC Midlands Investigations team
","A successful violinist who sent lewd images of himself to two women he had never met has been given a 12-month suspended prison sentence.
Ben Gunnery, who has toured the world throughout his career, targeted his victims in November, four months after being found guilty of sending the same explicit content to another woman.
Gunnery found the women online and within days was sending them unsolicited images of his genitals.
The victims contacted police after seeing the BBC's interview with his previous victim Anna Downes, in which she said the images and videos of Gunnery left her so traumatised she struggled to sleep.
This story contains details of sexual harassment some may find upsetting.
Gunnery, from Vauxhall, London, previously admitted sending images of his genitals to the two women with the intention of causing distress or humiliation.
The content sent to them included photos of his erect penis and videos of him masturbating.
At Bromley Magistrates' Court on Monday, Gunnery's defence said his offences were committed when he was taking drugs, and he felt shame and embarrassment over his behaviour.
""He's seen a complete devastation of his career. He can't get work, his reputation is damaged. He's on benefits,"" it said.
Addressing Gunnery, Judge Vanessa Lloyd said: ""They're deliberate acts. It's not the drugs speaking, they bring out something in you.""
""I don't believe you were under the influence on every occasion. It's you that's doing this, and this isn't the first time.
""You comply with rehabilitation but it doesn't change your behaviour.""
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Gunnery's actions were ""clearly deliberate"".
""This hasn't just happened once, he continues to do it,"" it said.
Gunnery was given a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years. If he re-offends, he will go to prison and serve half with the rest on licence.
Remaining on the sex offender's register, he was given a 10-year notification requirement and five-year sexual harm prevention order.
He will not be allowed to have more than one mobile phone and internet device. He was also ordered to complete drug and alcohol rehabilitation.
""Breaching any of the orders is a one-way ticket to immediate imprisonment. It's up to you,"" Lloyd added.
Prosecutor Adrita Ahmed said Gunnery's actions have had a significant impact on his victims.
""Their sense of safety was violated by the sexual images Gunnery sent which were not asked for, not welcome and not harmless,"" she added.
The 46-year-old's offending was first revealed when Anna Downes from Worcestershire contacted the BBC after he sent her the pictures.
West Mercia Police took nearly six months to pass the case on to the Metropolitan Police, who then arrested and charged Gunnery.
But months after being given a community order, he was doing it again.
We are calling one of the victims Kate, a female musician from Glasgow, who had also never met Gunnery.
He approached her online to buy music from her, but then sent her a photograph and two videos in November 2025.
Kate contacted police after seeing Anna's story.
""[Seeing] the sheer scale of what he had done – that's what made me take action,"" she said.
In her victim impact statement, Kate described feeling traumatised.
""I barely slept, I couldn't keep food down, and I was under so much stress that I lost work, I had PTSD flashbacks from previous trauma as a child where trust was broken by men, and I felt completely humiliated.""
She described what he did as ""wholly inappropriate, unacceptable, illegal, invasive, unwanted, unprompted and a complete abuse of power as a male musician towards a female musician.""
""[It] has left me in complete disbelief that this type of behaviour is still allowed to continue in 2025,"" she told the court.
Gunnery was given a two-year restraining order in relation to Kate.
For the offences committed against her, Gunnery was given a six-month suspended sentence with drug and alcohol rehabilitation requirements.
Kate's husband is also a musician, and told the BBC that he was outraged by Gunnery's behaviour.
Kate told the court she is having therapy, and feels on edge if men approach her and does not feel safe when she's performing on stage.
Downes, who waived her right to anonymity, said cyberflashing needed to be taken more seriously and she had felt forced to investigate the crime herself.
""I was just stunned and felt horrified and violated,"" she said last year.
""I had quite a long period of time where I would struggle to get to sleep at night and every time I shut my eyes, I would be faced with these images again.""
Det Insp KP Pender praised the courage of Gunnery's victims in coming forward.
""Their willingness to report what happened, and to support the investigation, has been vital in bringing Gunnery to justice for these disgraceful crimes,"" he added.
Gunnery performed music for films and toured the world, and until he was arrested for the offences in 2025, was teaching children and adults despite being on the Sex Offender's Register.
Cyberflashing is when offenders send unsolicited explicit images to people via an online platform, such as messaging applications and social media.
It can also be done by sending content using data-sharing tools like Bluetooth or Airdrop.
It became a crime in the UK on 31 January 2024, and carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.
New research led by Prof Clare McGlynn of Durham University and Prof Fiona Vera-Gray from London Metropolitan University found women were almost three times more likely to experience cyberflashing than men.
Twenty-three per cent of women have experienced cyberflashing in their lifetime, compared to 8% of men.
It is also alarmingly common in the lives of younger women - 45% of women aged 18 to 24 report this experience, compared to 15% of men in the same age range.
The data also showed that sexual exposure is causing extensive freedom-based harms, limiting women's ability to participate freely in both physical and digital spaces, reducing independence, and physical and mental wellbeing among other things.
It also found that many people change their behaviour to stay safe - 37% of women avoid interacting with strangers online compared to 14% of men; and 26% of women restrict access to their online activity, while 11% of men take this step.

Police assessing claims about Andrew sharing confidential trade details,2026-02-09T18:37:33.909Z," Chi Chi Izundu
Investigations correspondent
","Thames Valley Police is assessing a complaint by anti-monarchy group Republic over the alleged sharing of confidential material by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor with Jeffrey Epstein.
According to emails recently released by the US government, a sender thought to be the former prince passed on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam and confidential details of investment opportunities.
Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.
The former Duke of York, who served as trade envoy between 2001 and 2011, has been contacted for comment but is yet to respond.
Andrew has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct.
Thames Valley Police have confirmed they are assessing whether there are grounds to investigate a complaint by Republic who have reported Andrew to the force for suspected misconduct in public office and breach of official secrets.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Thames Valley Police said: ""We can confirm receipt of this report and are assessing the information in line with our established procedures.""
According to material seen by the BBC, the emails indicate that on 7 October 2010, Andrew sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong, where he was accompanied by business associates of Epstein.
After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then-special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.
In a separate email exchange in 2010, the former prince appeared to send Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
At this time, those efforts were overseen by the British armed forces and were funded by the UK government.
Sir Vince Cable, who was then business secretary, said: ""I was unaware of Andrew... sharing information about investment opportunities [in Afghanistan] before, this is the first I've heard of it.""
More than a year later, Andrew again appeared to reach out to Epstein to alert him to a new investment opportunity with a private equity firm he had visited a week earlier.
All of these email exchanges took place after 2008, when Epstein was convicted of child sex offences.
Official terms of reference for trade envoys state that they ""are not civil servants"", adding: ""However, the role of a Trade Envoy carries with it a duty of confidentiality in relation to information received. This may include sensitive, commercial, or political information shared about relevant markets/visits.
""This duty of confidentiality will continue to apply after the expiry of their term of office. In addition, the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1989 will apply.""

"Cardiff Airport's £205m handout 'unlawful', claims Bristol",2026-02-09T18:32:59.735Z," Huw Thomas
Wales business correspondent
","A planned £205.2m subsidy of Cardiff Airport ""should be declared unlawful"", lawyers for Bristol Airport have argued at a competition tribunal.
They said that the size of the Welsh government subsidy was unprecedented in UK aviation and a breach of competition rules.
The government will respond during the second day of the tribunal on Tuesday, but has previously defended its 10-year plan to invest in the airport, which it has owned since 2013.
The competition appeal tribunal is expected to last two days.
In April 2025 the Welsh government officially awarded a subsidy worth £205.2m to Cardiff Airport, with £20m already allocated to be spent during the current financial year. The full amount would be phased over 10 years.
Ministers said the subsidy would support new maintenance facilities, hangars and cargo capacity. New routes would also be developed, concentrating on global aviation hubs and destinations that could also support Wales's economic growth.
After seeing the size and details of the proposed subsidy, Bristol Airport filed an appeal with the competition appeal tribunal in July 2025.
At a tribunal hearing in Cardiff, a barrister for Bristol Airport called for the subsidy to be quashed.
""We say the subsidy should be declared unlawful,"" said Ewan West KC.
He said Bristol was ""not seeking to drive Cardiff from the market,"" and that ""Bristol relishes competition"".
But Mr West said such competition ""must be fair and lawful"".
It is evident in assessing the impact of the subsidy that ""Welsh ministers have failed to appreciate, and seriously underestimate"" the harm to Bristol, the barrister told the tribunal.
Ahead of the hearing Bristol Airport argued the investment amounted to a subsidy of £71.50 per passenger, and that the taxpayer would be paying for people to go on holiday from Cardiff Airport. It claimed that passengers and airlines could be drawn away by means that were anti-competitive.
During the hearing Bristol Airport's barrister also argued that Cardiff Airport should have been more seriously treated as an ""ailing or insolvent enterprise"" during a review of the subsidy, a legal category which would have triggered extra checks before public money could be used to subsidise the business.
Welsh government lawyers will respond to the appeal by Bristol Airport during the second day of the hearing.
The Welsh government has previously said it would defend the legal challenge by Bristol Airport, and that it would ""fight for our ability to invest"" in Cardiff Airport's ""long-term prosperity and shape its economic destiny"".
In a statement ahead of the hearing, Bristol Airport said the Welsh government's subsidy ""was unlawful, disproportionate, and would unfairly harm airport and airline competition.""
It added that it would be ""asking the tribunal to quash the subsidy decision made by the Welsh government, which it believes failed to lawfully apply the subsidy control principles, resulting in a subsidy that should not have been granted"".
A spokesperson for the Welsh government said ministers would present their position ""through the proper legal process"".
They added: ""As the case is the subject of ongoing litigation, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this stage.""
A panel of three, chaired by Ben Tidswell, is hearing Bristol Airport's appeal against the subsidy and the response of Welsh ministers.
The hearing is expected to last two days, with a decision likely to be deferred until a later date.

'Anxious' residents prepare for more flooding,2026-02-09T14:45:22.892Z," Leigh Boobyer
Somerset
","""Anxious"" residents have said they are preparing for flooding as more downpours are predicted.
A Met Office yellow weather warning is in place for parts of Wiltshire and Somerset until 23:59 GMT as up to 30mm (1.2 inches) of rain could fall in some parts.
More than 35 warnings are also in effect across Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire, where the Environment Agency (EA) said flooding is expected near villages.
Briony Sadler, from Somerset's campaign group Flooding on the Levels Action Group, said: ""Levels did go down a little bit, they have come back up again. This makes people super, super anxious.""
Declaring a ""major incident"" two weeks ago, Somerset Council officials have been supporting residents hit by flooding.
Heavy downpours have caused a number of key roads to close and a small number of people remain in temporary accommodation after their homes were flooded, a Somerset Council spokesperson added.
Gideon Amos, MP for Taunton and Wellington, told BBC Radio Somerset some of his constituents have sandbags across their doors and have wrapped their furniture in bags so they float.
""The situation remains perilous for many people.
""Isn't it time we have permanent pumping stations ready to roll with a flick of a switch, rather than these trigger points being waited for and losing precious days.
""That would be a big, expensive job but it would be an investment that would save money in the long run,"" he added.
A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said they have made almost £78bn available to England's councils this year.
""We will continue working with local authorities in the south-west where emergencies occur, and will consider requests where financial support might be needed,"" they added.
The EA has issued flood warnings for properties in villages by the River Tone near Taunton, and those by the River Parrett including Moorland and West Yeo.
An EA spokesperson said they have deployed additional pumps across the Somerset Levels and Moors, and staff are on duty 24 hours a day.
""Installation of ultra-high volume submersible pumps at Dunball is under way on our expected schedule,"" they added.
In Wiltshire, 28 flood warnings have been issued for the Upper Avon between Chippenham and Melksham, with properties in Reybridge also at risk, according to the EA.
A warning is also in place for homes in Maisemore, Twyning and Sandhurst in Gloucestershire. And flooding on the A417 between Maisemore and Over near Gloucester is causing delays for motorists.

William and Catherine say they are 'deeply concerned' in first statement on Epstein revelations,2026-02-09T12:06:12.188Z," Sean SeddonandDaniela Relph
Royal correspondent
","The Prince and Princess of Wales have said they are ""deeply concerned"" by the latest revelations about Jeffrey Epstein in their first public statement on the scandal.
A Kensington Palace spokesperson said Prince William and Catherine were ""focused on the victims"" in light of new information contained in documents related to the late sex offender released in the US.
The statement was released after more allegations against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor emerged, increasing the scrutiny on the former prince.
A royal spokesperson said: ""I can confirm The Prince and Princess have been deeply concerned by the continuing revelations.
""Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.""
Although the two-line statement from the Prince and Princess of Wales made no direct reference to Epstein, Andrew or his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has also faced further questions in light of the latest document release, it remains significant, if not explicit.
It was published as Prince William prepared to begin an official visit to Saudi Arabia, a trip which has been viewed as highly significant diplomatically.
He and royal aides are well aware that as headlines around Epstein continue to swirl, so does the scrutiny on the Royal Family's response.
Fallout continues after Mandelson resigns over Epstein links - follow live
In releasing the statement, William will hope that it shows he is concerned and not oblivious to the damaging headlines, as well as clearing the way for focus on his official trip to Saudi Arabia.
However, it is unlikely that it will completely shut down questions over the royal's handling of the Andrew scandal.
King Charles was heckled during a visit to Clitheroe train station in Lancashire on Monday, with one member of the public shouting, ""how long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?"" as he greeted a crowd.
Mountbatten-Windsor had a long-running friendship with Epstein and maintained contact with the American financier after his conviction for a child sex offence in 2008.
He has previously apologised for his past ties with Epstein but has strenuously denied any wrongdoing.
While reports have emerged in recent years that William favours a further cutting of ties with his disgraced uncle, he and other senior royals have largely refrained from commenting on the allegations against him.
The King last directly mentioned Epstein's victims in October when he stripped Andrew of his titles, and last week Prince Edward referred to victims when asked about the Epstein fallout at a government conference in Dubai.
Last week saw Mountbatten-Windsor move out of his Windsor home ahead of schedule in light of new information about his relationship with Epstein.
Buckingham Palace had said he would leave Royal Lodge in early 2026, but his departure appears to have been sped up, with the former prince now living on the King's privately owned Sandringham Estate.
But continued disclosures in the US have increased the pressure on Mountbatten-Windsor, who has faced calls to give evidence to an American inquiry.
Included in a massive trove of documents released in the US are images appearing to show Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over a woman.
No context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken.
The latest documents also appear to confirm that a notorious picture of Mountbatten-Windsor and his accuser Virginia Giuffre is real.
He has previously questioned whether a picture of him with his arm around Guiffre had been doctored and claimed he had never met her. She alleged she was made to have sex with him as a teenager.
But in an email apparently written by Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is also in the image, in 2015, she said: ""In 2001 I was in London when [redacted] met a number of friends of mine including Prince Andrew. A photograph was taken as I imagine she wanted to show it to friends and family.""
He has always denied the claim and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022. It contained no admission of liability or apology.
Thames Valley Police has confirmed it is assessing allegations reported by the BBC that a second woman says she was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with Mountbatten-Windsor.
The encounter allegedly occurred at his former Royal Lodge residence in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.
Other emails appear to show Mountbatten-Windsor knowingly shared confidential information with Epstein from his official work as a trade envoy in 2010 and 2011.
Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.
But emails show the former prince passing on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam, and confidential details of investment opportunities, to Epstein.
The Royal Family has sought to distance itself from Andrew, beginning in 2019 when it was announced he would step back from royal duties.
Since then, he has lost his titles, military offices and official roles, and has only very occasionally been seen at official events.
But there has been continued pressure on the Palace to signal a clean break from Andrew as public anger over his alleged conduct continues.

Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.
The former Duke of York, who served as trade envoy between 2001 and 2011, has been contacted for comment but is yet to respond.
Andrew has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct.
The emails indicate that on 7 October 2010, Andrew sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong, where he was accompanied by business associates of Epstein.
After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then-special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.

Andrew told BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he last saw Epstein in New York in early December 2010 to tell the disgraced financier he was breaking off the friendship.
However, on Christmas Eve that year, he emailed Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money.
By this time, Epstein was already a convicted sex offender.
Sir Vince Cable, who was then business secretary, said: ""I was unaware of Andrew... sharing information about investment opportunities [in Afghanistan] before, this is the first I've heard of it.""
In a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew suggests Epstein might invest in a private equity firm he visited a week before.
Official terms of reference for trade envoys state that they ""are not civil servants"", adding: ""However, the role of a Trade Envoy carries with it a duty of confidentiality in relation to information received. This may include sensitive, commercial, or political information shared about relevant markets/visits.
""This duty of confidentiality will continue to apply after the expiry of their term of office. In addition, the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1989 will apply.""
Andrew has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein.
He was stripped of his royal titles in October last year following increasing numbers of questions about his links to the late, convicted sex offender.
Earlier in February, Andrew moved out of his home in Windsor to the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.
Buckingham Palace had announced in October that he would be moving from Royal Lodge, at the same time his title of prince was removed.
The former prince left the property on Monday night and is currently living at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate while his new permanent home undergoes renovations.

Government blocks local plan due to lack of housing,2026-02-08T15:12:22.632Z," Martin Heath
Hertfordshire political reporter
","The government has put a council's blueprint for the future on hold because it does not include enough houses.
The minister for housing and planning has told Three Rivers District Council in Hertfordshire that its local plan has a shortfall of more than 5,000 dwellings.
It has been ordered not to take the plan any further until the minister has decided whether to direct that changes are made.
The council says it will comply with an order to provide evidence for its housing numbers within a fortnight.
Councils have to have local plans to guide development, manage land use and decide whether to approve planning applications.
These plans have to be kept up to date.
Three Rivers District Council is going through the process of producing its latest version, but the minister for housing and planning, Matthew Pennycook, has written to the council to say it is not good enough.
His letter says the plan only provides for 56% of the houses the district will need between now and 2041.
He wrote: ""I have little confidence that your emerging plan is satisfactory and capable of being found sound or legally compliant at examination.""
He has put the plan on hold and given the council two weeks to provide evidence to support its position.
He will then decide whether to order changes to the plan.
Stephen Giles-Medhurst, who leads the Liberal Democrat minority administration, said he was ""disappointed at the intervention at this stage"".
He hoped the minister would take into account that the district was 76% greenbelt but ""we are open to discussion [and] cooperation and will certainly provide all the evidence"".
He accepted that the minister could insist on a figure in excess of 12,000 new houses, whereas the local plan as it stood allowed for 7,500.
OIiver Cooper, the leader of the Conservative group, said the council only provided ""one line"" of evidence to support ruling out large developments.
He added: ""Providing one line provides no defence of our greenbelt whatsoever, and yet the council leadership thought it knew better.""
Stephen Cox, the leader of the council's Labour group, said: ""The council, as requested, will now supply the rationale as to why it came up with the number of new homes that it did, which was short of even the previous Conservative government's housing targets.
""Even the night before the plan was settled upon, the Tories were arguing for fewer sites and an even lower number of homes whilst simultaneously having claimed the council's figure of 7,027 was itself not enough.
""People can see how stupid that is.""
Rue Grewal, who leads the Independent group, said she knew ""how much time and effort residents have put into engaging with the process and why this letter has caused such frustration and concern"".
Chris Mitchell from the Green group was ""very disappointed"", and said officers and councillors had ""put in so much work and evidence to build a very balanced local plan"".

Flight to UK for turtle washed up in Storm Goretti,2026-02-08T12:16:04.171Z," Zhara Simpson
Channel Islands
","A rare turtle that washed up in Jersey following Storm Goretti is to be flown to the UK for rehabilitation.
Crush, a loggerhead turtle, was given life-saving treatment at New Era Veterinary Hospital in St Saviour, Jersey, after she was found extremely weak and suffering from malnutrition.
The vet practice said the creature would not cope with a ferry journey but Loganair had offered to transport her by plane.
The airline has received special permission to fly Crush passenger side to Southampton where she will continue her rehabilitation.
From Southampton, Crush will be taken to the Sealife centre at Weymouth in Dorset.
Crush was found on a beach during Storm Goretti in January.
Vets believe exposure to cold water in the English Channel resulted in her suffering ""cold stunning"", which causes a turtle's body to shut down.
The animal hospital said on social media she would be put into quarantine in a tank for a ""few weeks"".
The post said: ""Then she will join another cold stunned turtle in a much larger tank.
""She will be fed up and get strong enough for a return to the wild in spring - when all five cold stunned turtles in the UK will be taken and released.
""We will all miss her but know she needs to get back to the wild.""

Jersey ministers rule out Guernsey-style tax review,2026-02-08T12:09:12.373Z," Jake Wallace
Channel Islands
","Jersey's Treasury Minister Elaine Millar said ""no consideration"" had been given to introducing a standard corporation tax in the island.
Currently the standard rate of company tax in Jersey is 0%, while finance firms pay 10% under a system known as ""Zero/10"".
It follows a written question from Deputy Max Andrews asking if the treasury had considered adopting a standard rate of corporate tax and if there were concerns about the current system.
Andrews' question came as officials in Guernsey review how much tax the island receives from businesses.
Jersey last made changes to its corporation tax regime in 2024 when it introduced a 15% tax for companies with global annual revenue of 750 million euros (£624m) or more.
Andrews asked Millar if the treasury had any concerns around the reliance on Zero/10 in relation to personal income tax.
Millar said Jersey must uphold Zero/10, describing it as a ""core strength"" and a ""key driver"" of the island's ""prominence as a globally leading International Finance Centre"".
""Jersey has a broad-based tax regime including GST and we are forecast to raise £185m from corporate income tax in 2026,"" Millar said.
""Furthermore, financial services companies are estimated to pay over half of overall tax revenues, including personal income tax from employees in finance.""
She added: ""In order to maintain and grow our tax base, including personal income taxes, for the benefit of all Islanders, it is essential that we preserve our zero/ten regime and our international tax competitiveness.""
The written questions from Andrews were submitted as politicians in Guernsey review their own zero/ten system.
The island's tax review sub-committee is due to submit full proposals for tax reform before the end of June, including corporate tax and whether to introduce a goods and services tax.
Andrews asked Millar if she had been in discussion with other Crown Dependencies on future corporation tax regimes.
Millar said ""no discussions or communications"" with her counterparts in Guernsey had taken place about changing Jersey's Zero/10 regime.
Chief Minister Lyndon Farnham said the government were keeping a ""close eye"" on developments in Guernsey but have ""no plans to review the islands tax position"".
""We are having to watch things very closely because we've seen inflation and we've had to curb the growth in the public service but we've got no plans to review things at this stage,"" he said.

Foreign Office to review Mandelson's US ambassador pay-off,2026-02-08T09:30:55.212Z," Iain Watson
Political correspondent
","A pay-off given to Lord Mandelson after he was sacked as ambassador to the US is being reviewed, UK Foreign Office sources have told the BBC.
The review was instigated after new details emerged about the peer's contact with Jeffrey Epstein and a separate police investigation was launched in the UK, they said.
The Labour peer is thought to have been given a pay-off of up to £40,000 after he was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links with the late convicted sex offender.
Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that Mandelson should ""either return [the money] or give it to an appropriate charity"".
No 10 sources earlier also called for Mandelson to pay the money back or give it to a charity that supports victims.
Mandelson's lawyers have been approached for comment.
The review comes after police searched two homes linked to Mandelson on Friday, following the latest release of the Epstein files in the US, which indicated email exchanges had taken place between him and Epstein about fiscal policy. Mandelson has not been arrested.
Government sources confirmed that the Foreign Office reached a financial settlement with Mandelson, but have not said how much this was for.
However, he is believed to have been given an exit payment equivalent to three months' salary according to the Times. While his salary as US ambassador has not been disclosed, the post typically has a salary of £155,000-£159,999. This would put a three months' pay-out at around £40,000.
It's understood the exact payment and the reasons for making it will be made public, after parliament decided on Wednesday that ministers should release government files and electronic communications about Mandelson before and during his appointment as ambassador to Washington.
A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""Peter Mandelson's civil service employment was terminated in accordance with legal advice and the terms and conditions of his employment.
""Normal civil services HR processes were followed. Further information will be provided to Parliament as part of the government response to the motion passed last week which is being co-ordinated by the cabinet office.""
Mandelson's association with Epstein - and the fact he remained in contact with the financier after the latter was convicted - was known at the time of his appointment in December 2024.
However, the peer was sacked from the role after Downing Street said new information about the depth of this relationship had emerged - including emails showing he sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced charges for sex offences in 2008.
Email exchanges in the latest US government release in January on Epstein included those while Mandelson was a member of Gordon Brown's cabinet.
Among them is one that indicates Lord Mandelson gave Epstein advance notice of a €500bn bailout by the EU to save the Euro in 2010.
Another included a 2009 memo in which Brown's policy adviser Nick Butler wrote about the UK's struggling economy and recommended selling off government-held assets to raise public funds.
The Metropolitan Police is currently investigating the peer over allegations of misconduct in public office.
Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Hayley Sewart said enquiries were ongoing.
""This will be a complex investigation requiring a significant amount of further evidence gathering and analysis. It will take some time to do this work comprehensively and we will not be providing a running commentary.""

Emails reveal more details of Epstein's celeb dinner for Andrew,2026-02-07T12:31:53.094Z," Sean Coughlan
Royal correspondent
","Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's last known face-to-face meeting with Jeffrey Epstein was in New York in December 2010.
According to Andrew's account in his BBC Newsnight interview, he went there to say a final farewell and to cease all connections with Epstein.
But emails released by the US Department for Justice provide more details of how, instead of a sombre goodbye, Andrew was the star guest at a lively gathering of celebrities at Epstein's multi-million Manhattan townhouse.
And instead of irrevocably cutting off ties to the sex offender, Andrew was in touch later that month to give seasons greetings to his ""US family"" and saying: ""Looking forward to joining you all again soon.""
That was at a time after Epstein had served a sentence for procuring a child for prostitution.
The latest cache of emails cast fresh light on the dinner party in 2010 thrown for Andrew, with a gathering of the rich and famous, in another example of Epstein's networking.
US entertainment publicist Peggy Siegal emailed Epstein the following morning to say the evening was ""sensational"".
Among the topics of conversation, according to the emails, was the forthcoming wedding of Prince William and Catherine, who married the following April.
""My favourite line: ""So Andrew tell us about the wedding. What are you wearing?"" He was not sure if I was kidding or not,"" says Siegal.
Andrew, who later described it as a ""small dinner party, there were only eight or 10 of us I think"", was said to have fended off requests for wedding invitations to Westminster Abbey.
Among the guests, according to the emails, were Woody Allen and his wife Soon-Yi, TV presenters Katie Couric and George Stephanopoulos, comedian Chelsea Handler and talk show host Charlie Rose.
Within days of the dinner party, details about the guests and their conversations had appeared in the US press - and the latest emails show an article being shared between Epstein and Siegal, with Epstein not happy with what seemed to have been a briefing to a journalist.
""Not good for andrew, not good for me,"" Epstein emailed about the apparent insider details being leaked.
The article claimed that Couric had told Andrew she would be broadcasting from outside the wedding and asked: ""If I e-mail your BlackBerry, will you give me the details on what is happening inside?""
Andrew is quoted as saying that the Royal Family were delighted with the approaching marriage and that ""Kate is a terrific girl.""
Woody Allen has played down his attendance at the event for Andrew.
""Someone, a publicist, invited Soon-Yi and me to a dinner at Jeffrey's house with one of those British royals. I can't remember the name because I don't follow the royals with any interest at all,"" he told the Sunday Times last autumn.
But other emails in the released files show multiple exchanges between Allen and Epstein, including Allen talking to him about film makers.
""If you don't like Bergman, which I know you don't, that's fine. I'm sure he's way too sophisticated for your taste. Should I now get you the box set on Bergman's movies?"" messages Allen to Epstein.
In another exchange Allen seems to be extolling the virtues of a new iPhone. ""I absolutely love this phone. Thank you, thank you, thank you,"" he says to Epstein.
The latest emails also show Allen's comments to Epstein about another dinner in December 2017.
""Thank you for dinner last night. Just so you know, in the future, food should always be served very hot; never lukewarm.;)"" wrote Allen.
There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing
Chelsea Handler has said that the dinner party was the only time she met Epstein and remembers Andrew being there and has joked about her own nervous comment to Woody Allen.
""Yeah, we had dinner and it was so awkward and so weird... I was like what are we doing here? And then I asked Woody Allen how he and Soon Yi met and that was when I left,"" she recalled in a podcast in 2021.
Soon Yi was the adopted daughter of Allen's former partner Mia Farrow.
The Manhattan dinner was the same week that Epstein and Andrew were photographed together in Central Park.
In Andrew's account of his relationship with Epstein, he had gone to New York to end their connection, because it was more ""honourable"" to finish things in person.
On Newsnight in 2019 he recounted what he'd said to Epstein in December 2010.
""Look, because of what has happened, I don't think it is appropriate that we should remain in contact,"" and by mutual agreement during that walk in the park we decided that we would part company and I left, I think it was the next day and to this day I never had any contact with him from that day forward,"" said Andrew in his TV interview.
The latest emails suggest a different outcome.
After he was back from the trip, an account that seems to be Andrew emailed Epstein: ""It was great to spend time with my US family. Looking forward to joining you all again soon.
""I'll call you tomorrow... as I am moving the family up to Sandringham during the day.""
There was an ongoing conversation about trying to sort out unpaid wages for Sarah Ferguson's staff, which was sufficiently annoying for ""the Duke"" to email Epstein: ""God it's cold and dank here! Wish I was still a pet in your family.""
Rather than the claimed irrevocable goodbye to Epstein, as the year ended Andrew sent an optimistic message: ""Wishing you a wonderful Christmas and spectacular entry into 2011.""

New ferry's Liverpool link priority for passengers,2026-02-07T07:28:06.246Z," Catherine Nicoll
Isle of Man
","There is demand for year-round ferry sailings between the Isle of Man and Liverpool, a survey has suggested.
More than 4,500 people took part in the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company's week-long canvass of opinions on its plans to commission a new ferry.
The firm said while it was too early to draw ""firm conclusions"" from the responses, all-weather operations running all year and journey times were also among the key priorities that had been identified.
Plans to replace the current fast craft, the Manannan, with a purpose-built vessel by 2030 were outlined by the Steam Packet last week.
Between March and October, the Manannan operates daily sailings between the island and the Manx government-funded ferry port at the Prince's Half-Tide Dock in Liverpool, as well as occasional seasonal journeys to Dublin and Belfast.
In the survey of views on what passengers wanted from a new ferry, many said speed was a consideration as it was felt important to maintain the current schedule of two return trips to Liverpool each day in the summer.
A spokesman for the Steam Packet said the ""huge volume of feedback"" had highlighted ""how central ferry services are to life on the Isle of Man"".
Although the majority who took part were island residents, he said about 30% lived elsewhere.
They included TT visitors and marshals, friends and relatives of residents, and business travellers.
The government-owned ferry firm has committed to publishing a full summary of the responses once the results have been analysed.

Epstein emails raise questions over role of Andrew's palace aide,2026-02-07T04:29:41.220Z," Rianna Croxford
Investigations correspondent
","An aide to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was asked by sex offender Jeffrey Epstein about arranging a dinner with a ""beautiful friend"" of his, nearly three years after the then-prince claimed to have cut ties, new emails show.
""I have a very beautiful friend comoing [sic] to london on tues. ANdrew might want to have her for a dinner,"" Epstein wrote in October 2013 to David Stern.
Emails appear to show Stern, a trusted royal insider, acted as a go-between for the pair after the then-Duke's relationship with Epstein began to receive scrutiny following his 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.
Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing. The BBC has tried to contact Stern for comment.
No further correspondence confirms whether Mountbatten-Windsor met Epstein's ""friend"".
Other emails seen by the BBC suggest that Stern, an enigmatic figure with little online presence, also invited Epstein to a dinner at Windsor Castle in 2017 - nearly a decade after he was convicted of child sex offences.
The latest email, released by the US Department of Justice, from Epstein suggesting that ""Andrew"" meet his ""beautiful friend"" is sent three years after he had separately suggested that ""The Duke"" might enjoy having dinner with a 26-year-old Russian woman in August 2010.
Correspondence seen by the BBC, released by the DOJ, shows that Stern regularly communicated with Epstein about royal business and personal affairs from at least 2009 to 2017, by which point he was acting as a director of Mountbatten-Windsor's company Pitch@Palace - a Dragons' Den-style start-up competition where entrepreneurs could present their ideas to potential investors.
Stern, an investor and German national, resigned as a director of Pitch@Palace in 2019. He was also a director of the St George's House Trust, based in Windsor Castle, from 2016 until 2022.
In April 2017, Stern emails Epstein - nearly a decade after his conviction - to say that he was organising a ""super"" dinner at Windsor Castle in May that year, asking ""who else"" he should invite.
In another email, dated the same day, Epstein appears to have the power to directly invite another business associate of his to the Windsor dinner, writing: ""I know you hate london do [sic] want a dinner invite at windsor castle with the top Chinese. biz people? may 26"".
The recipient asks Epstein if he will be present at the dinner, to which he responds: ""no, I have a havard [sic] event"", potentially implying he was invited but unable to attend.
The emails suggest that Epstein continued to have a much more influential and closer relationship with Mountbatten-Windsor and royal residences in the years after the former Duke had claimed to BBC Newsnight to have cut contact with him in December 2010.
In 2014, Stern messages Epstein to say that ""PA [Prince Andrew] sends his birthday wishes and love"" alongside a picture of him with the then-Duke and Duchess of York.
The message apparently from Stern also wishes Epstein ""Happy Birthday"" and shares a crude photo of champagne being poured down a naked woman, adding: ""Champagne for you (even though you don't drink it)"".
He appears to keep in frequent contact with Epstein about his work and access to the Palace, emailing Epstein in 2010 that he was at Prince Andrew's ""birthday party"" and boasting about the famous celebrities he had encountered.
Other emails seem to show that Stern had also acted around this time as a conduit between Epstein and Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of York.
In 2011, emails include one from Stern's account which sent Epstein a message from ""Sarah"" mentioning ""The Duke"", in which she congratulates him on the apparent birth of a ""baby boy"".
After the crash of a business venture in 2009, Ferguson also appears to write to Epstein: ""I urgently need 20,000 pounds ($27,521) for rent today"" following an exchange with Stern, which she is copied into.
A spokesman for Sarah Ferguson previously told the BBC that she was told to congratulate Epstein on a baby but has no knowledge beyond that.
Further emails, as part of the three million published last week, also shed new light on Epstein's apparent invitation to have dinner with ""The Duke"" at Buckingham Palace in 2010, and that the sex offender requested to bring three women along with him.
On 27 September that year, Epstein emails ""The Duke"" to say that he is in London and asks what time Mountbatten-Windsor would like him and a woman, who the BBC is not naming.
""The Duke"" suggests they could have ""dinner"" at Buckingham Palace and ""lots of privacy"", to which Epstein agrees, responding that he is with three women.
Epstein asks if he should ""bring them all, so as to add some life"", in the email exchanges. ""Yes. Plenty of space here for chat! Bring them,"" says ""The Duke"".
In a previous email, sent months prior, Epstein had described one of the women as ""a great friend"" and ""very pretty"" after ""The Duke"" asked who she was.
Another email, sent the evening before the dinner, appears to show that Epstein had also personally invited a fourth woman to the Buckingham Palace meet-up, asking if she wanted to join and that she agreed.
The BBC has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising out of his association with Epstein.
The BBC has spent days trying to contact Stern for comment.

Their parents are in disgrace - what now for Beatrice and Eugenie?,2026-02-07T00:12:47.699Z," Noor Nanji
Royal correspondentandDoug Faulkner
","After a bruising week, it's hard to overstate the mess that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Sarah Ferguson find themselves in.
But increasingly it appears it's a mess their daughters also can't escape.
The newly released emails indicate that Jeffrey Epstein had a bigger presence than previously thought in the lives of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.
One exchange suggests they had lunch with him in Miami, just days after his release from prison for prostituting minors. Elsewhere, it appears they were called upon by him to entertain his contacts and give tours of Buckingham Palace.
For Beatrice, now 37, and Eugenie, 35, these new revelations could put their future under scrutiny.
""It will raise questions from the public about just what they were doing,"" says royal commentator Richard Palmer.
But royal journalist Victoria Murphy says while the emails make for ""really, really uncomfortable reading"", there continues to be sympathy towards the princesses.
And there's no doubt that seeing a picture apparently of your father on all fours, crouching over a young woman, can only be deeply embarrassing.
It should be said Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing, and being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.
So after the York family brand has been dragged through the mud, where do the princesses now fit within the Royal Family?
Both princesses are repeatedly mentioned in the latest dump of Epstein files.
Media reports of the alleged lunch in Miami have often referred to ""the girls"", suggesting they were younger than they were.
At the time of that visit Eugenie was 19 and Beatrice was 21.
""They weren't five-year-old girls when they were taken to see Epstein. They were grown ups,"" argues author Andrew Lownie, who wrote the book Entitled about Andrew. ""There's a big campaign to say they are innocents caught up in the shellfire, but they're not, they're deeply involved.""
But Murphy disagrees with that portrayal, arguing it's understandable to see why they went along with it.
""It's easy to be critical of that decision now that Epstein's crimes are front and centre, but if no-one was raising any flags for them at the time you can see how they would just have gone on the trip their mother organised.""
The perks of being friends with Jeffrey Epstein are also apparent.
An exchange between Epstein and his assistant seems to suggest he paid for the family's flights, totalling ""for all tickets: $14,080.10"".
But it was not all one way.
On several occasions Epstein appears to ask Ferguson if her daughters can meet people, and on one appears to ask for them to show the redacted person Buckingham Palace.
Once, Ferguson apologises, saying they were not around and explaining their whereabouts.
In another extraordinary exchange, a ""Sarah"" appears to refer to Eugenie's love life - saying she is returning from a ""shagging weekend"".
In some of the emails, Epstein's contacts also refer to the princesses.
One email, sent to Epstein from a friend, reads: ""Just spoke to Duchess of Pork. She is at this wild lunch with Beatrice. I just introduced myself to her. Told her 1 know (barely) her father and how terrific he is...more later.""
Ferguson's representatives have been asked for comment.
But for Palmer, the repeated mentions of both princesses in the emails ""makes it difficult to distance themselves"" from the saga. ""There's no avoiding the links between the Yorks and Epstein,"" he says.
Neither of the sisters are working royals. Both are married with children, and have their own careers. But like other royals both princesses also have philanthropic endeavours.
Eugenie co-founded the Anti-Slavery Collective, a charity whose focus includes victims of sex trafficking.
""It's a preposterously inappropriate cause for [Eugenie] to be involved with,"" said Lownie.
According to the most recently available accounts, donations have slumped - from £1.5m in 2024 to £48,000 in the year ending 2025, although it has a healthy sum of money in reserves. No income was raised from events or auctions in the year to 2025, compared with the previous financial year when a major gala fundraiser was held.
The charity has said that it hopes to hold a similar gala every three years. But a source from the sector has said it is ""difficult optically to do anything high profile like that again"".
""Unsurprisingly, it's keeping a low profile,"" they added.
BBC News has approached the Anti-Slavery Collective multiple times to ask for a comment in light of the latest controversy surrounding Andrew and Epstein, but it has not responded.
We also approached a number of other charities the princesses are involved with, asking whether they retain their confidence in light of the recent emails.
Outward Bound said Princess Beatrice is involved with the group ""in her honorary role as Deputy Patron"".
But Salvation Army, which has a long-standing partnership with Eugenie, struck a more cautious note. ""We place victims and survivors at the heart of all our decision making and we are closely monitoring this story,"" a spokesperson said.
Away from their charity work, the princesses both also have jobs.
Beatrice founded advisory firm BY-EQ, while Eugenie works as a director at the art gallery Hauser & Wirth in Mayfair.
It has recently faced legal challenges regarding alleged breaches of Russian sanctions, though it strongly contests these accusations. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Eugenie. Southwark Crown Court told BBC News the trial date had been set for 2028.
Last year, around the time her father lost his prince title, Beatrice was pictured at an investment summit in Saudi Arabia. Her family have long-held links to the Middle East and she also recently appeared in a promotional picture for a UAE bank.
Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi have also been involved in some of her father's business activities. They were present at Pitch@Palace, Andrew's start up business network, and were pictured meeting the then-Chinese ambassador to the UK in 2020, alongside her parents.
Palmer suggests there may have been a blurring of royal role and personal profit.
The princess, he said, built her career off the back of her royal status and introductions her parents gave her, ""meeting all sorts of business contacts and members of royal families abroad"".
Both princesses have independently wealthy husbands, and two children each.
Beatrice's husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi is a property developer, descended from Italian nobility, while Eugenie's, Jack Brooksbank, has worked in hospitality and marketing.
Beatrice splits her time between her Cotswolds property and an apartment in St James' Palace. Eugenie lives between Portugal and Ivy Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.
It is understood the princesses do pay rent on their royal properties. But the Palace would not confirm if it is paid at a market rate. It comes at a time of mounting calls for wider transparency about royal finances, following the outcry over Andrew's lease agreement at his former Windsor mansion.
This week, Andrew moved to the King's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, which means he is no longer close to his daughters and grandchildren. At present Ferguson's whereabouts are unknown, although there has been speculation she may move to Portugal to live with her younger daughter.
Privately, the princesses remain in touch with their parents, says Palmer. ""From what I understand, they are still speaking to them,"" he says, ""and want to remain loyal to them.""
But in public, he says, they will keep their distance. ""They need to separate themselves publicly from their parents, otherwise [they] risk the toxicity spreading further to them.""
When Andrew lost his titles, Beatrice and Eugenie kept theirs. There is also no change to the line of succession.
But some have questioned where they now fit within the wider Royal Family.
The sisters have always been said to be close to the Prince of Wales and Duke of Sussex and have shared what it is like to grow up in the limelight.
Eugenie is reported to have been particularly close to Harry, and travelled to California to visit him.
Footage in the Harry and Meghan documentary showed her attending the Super Bowl, going on bike rides with her cousin and playing with his son Archie on a beach.
Like Harry, both Beatrice and Eugenie have now found themselves on the outskirts of the family. But even in recent years, with their father's disgrace hanging over them, they have continued to attend, and be part of, royal occasions.
The biggest question mark for many, was where they would spend this past Christmas.
Until the last minute, it was unclear whether the princesses would appear at Sandringham. But in the end, they did - choosing to spend Christmas Day with the wider Royal Family, rather than with their parents in disgrace at Royal Lodge.
For Lownie, it's a clear sign that a deal was struck between Andrew and the King - that he and Ferguson would ""go quietly"", so long as their daughters were protected.
But what's also clear is that they wouldn't have been there if King Charles had not wanted them there. Their appearance gives us an insight into how the Palace is seeing things: Beatrice and Eugenie are still members of the Royal Family. They are still in the firm, and will be looked after.
As the Royal Family walked the short distance from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church for the Christmas Day service, both Beatrice and Eugenie, alongside their husbands, were prominent among the group, just behind the King and Queen.
It is, perhaps, a sign of how they intend to move forward amid the Epstein fallout.
Until now, the princesses have always been seen as part of a package, together with Andrew and Ferguson as part of the House of York.
Whatever happens next, Beatrice and Eugenie will need to step out from their shadow if they are to continue to be an active part of the Royal Family.

Guantanamo detainee's lawyers claim office raid by UK was unlawful,2026-02-06T18:52:43.548Z," Daniel De Simone
Investigations correspondent
Royal Courts of Justice
","The government unlawfully trespassed in a barrister's office and seized legal papers from her safe in a major national security case, the High Court has heard.
The case centres on claims of complicity by UK intelligence services in torture by the CIA of alleged al-Qaeda operative Abu Faraj al-Libi, who is held at Guantanamo Bay.
During a hearing in London, his barrister Jesse Nicholls said government security officers had conducted an ""unlawful entry, search, sift and seizure"" of documents.
Mr Justice Chamberlain directed that ""all the material"" taken from the barrister's safe be returned to her.
He ordered a further hearing on 25 March, which will consider whether the government's actions were unlawful.
The affected barrister is Rachel Toney, who represents al-Libi's interests in secret hearings which are closed to him and his own lawyers.
Like many cases involving MI5 and MI6, this one takes place partly in secret to allow the government to use evidence it deems too sensitive to disclose publicly, or to al-Libi and his lawyers.
Access to the closed part of the case is available only to the judge, government, and security-cleared barristers known as special advocates who represent al-Libi. Toney is a special advocate in this case and in many others.
The special advocates are separate from al-Libi's own solicitors and barristers, who can only communicate with the special advocates using messages sent via an official go-between - a civil servant - to check that nothing secret is disclosed.
Government security officers entered Toney's chambers last month.
In written submissions, al-Libi's barristers said the government had ""proceeded to enter her chambers despite having been refused permission, enter her safe in her absence, and remove the very working material over which consent had been expressly refused, in both electronic and paper form"".
In the absence of judicial authority for the search, they argued the move was ""obviously unlawful"".
They said the government team had sifted through legally privileged material and accessed her laptop before proceeding to delete multiple files.
The government seized and deleted documents relating to another case that Toney worked on - that of a Palestinian man called Abu-Zubaydah - who was tortured by the CIA.
The BBC revealed in January that the UK government had paid him a ""substantial"" sum of compensation to settle a case in which he said MI5 and MI6 were complicit in his torture.
Al-Libi's barristers said the government's knowledge of CIA torture programmes is key to his case, and that Toney's existing awareness of this subject means she is at ""at least as familiar"" with the relevant material as the government's own lawyers.
They argued the seizure was therefore ""heavily aggravated by the circumstances and appears to have had a doubtful or improper motive"". They said this motive was to ""gain a litigation advantage"" at a time when Toney was being effective and therefore proving ""troublesome"" for the government.
They asked whether Attorney General Lord Hermer was aware in advance and had given his consent.
In a legal note by Toney and her fellow special advocate, they said that her access to the Abu Zubaydah material has ""unsurprisingly"" been important given the similarities between his case and the al-Libi one.
They said the government's actions were ""unprecedented"" and that the ""inescapable conclusion is that Miss Toney has been singled out"".
""We are concerned that the motivation is to achieve an advantage in the litigation, and whether that is in fact the motivation, that is its clear effect"", they added.
They said, such is their ""disquiet"" at what has occurred, that they are ""considering resigning from this case"".
In a letter to al-Libi's lawyers, seen by the BBC, the government said the intelligence services had not consented to the use of material disclosed in the Abu Zubaydah case, and that their position is that Toney is not entitled to use that material.
During the hearing, Rory Phillips KC, representing the government, said the search and seizure was carried out by an independent legal section of the government that deals with special advocates. The judge put it to him that the person who went to Toney's chambers is ""your agent"", but he denied this.
At the end of the hearing, following a closed session to which the BBC did not have access, Mr Justice Chamberlain said Toney is permitted to use the material to prepare for a hearing in the case later this month. He said this direction was with the consent of the government, which also now consented to giving her the documents back.
Al-Libi, a Libyan national, has been imprisoned without trial at Guantanamo Bay since 2006. He was captured by Pakistani special forces in May 2005 and transferred to US custody within days.
Al-Libi alleges that he suffered torture and extreme mistreatment while held at secret CIA prisons known as 'black sites' in various countries, whilst MI5 and MI6 passed questions for use during his interrogations.
US authorities say he was a senior al-Qaeda figure and had long-term associations with Osama Bin Laden.

Mountain Road stays shut overnight due to snow and ice,2026-02-06T17:34:28.278Z," Catherine Nicoll
Isle of Man
","The Isle of Man's Mountain Road will remain closed overnight due to snow and ice along some sections of the route.
Police said conditions had varied ""tremendously"" on the 14 miles between the Creg Ny Baa and Ramsey Hairpin, with some areas ""extremely slippy"" and others ""virtually snow free"".
The closure of the route has been extended until 10:00 GMT on Saturday.
A spokesman for the force said an inspection of the condition of the road will be held early in the morning that day.
A yellow weather warning had been in place earlier between midday and 16:00 GMT for large waves breaking over coastal roads and walkways bringing debris ashore.
As a result of the ongoing rough seas, the morning sailing of the Manxman from the island to Lancashire was pushed back by an hour to 09:00.
The knock-on effect of that saw the return journey to Douglas from Heysham Port delayed until 14:45.
It follows the cancellation of all of Thursday's ferry crossings due to the stormy weather.

Epstein emails: So-called 'shady financier' was Andrew's 'trusted money man',2026-02-06T16:03:14.458Z," Ben King
business reporterandSean Coughlan
royal correspondent
","The Epstein files have cast new light on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's relationship with the controversial businessman David Rowland, revealing that Andrew told Jeffrey Epstein this was his ""trusted money man"".
Emails seem to show Andrew trying to promote Rowland's financial ventures, at a time when Andrew was the UK' s trade envoy.
However, Epstein appeared reluctant to engage with the multi-millionaire Conservative Party donor, after he was warned that the UK press were calling Rowland a ""shady financier"".
Rowland's son Jonathan told the BBC he and his father ""never had any contact or correspondence or had dinner or met with"" Epstein.
Rowland's private bank, Banque Havilland, has since fallen foul of regulators in London and Luxembourg, and had its banking licence withdrawn in 2024 by the European Central Bank. It is appealling this.
The latest emails, released by the US Department of Justice, appear to show Andrew encouraging Epstein to invest in the ventures of David and Jonathan Rowland.
There have been many previous claims about links between Andrew and Rowland's private bank, but the Epstein emails also suggest Rowland lent money to Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. There also seems to be irritation at how she had spent it.
""Will finalise F summary for you next week. Can't now cause she went to nepal paying for the first class flight with her rowland bank loan,"" writes a business contact to Epstein in September 2009.
This ""F"" appears to refer to Ferguson, who was photographed in Nepal the day the email was sent.
Media reports have claimed in the past that Andrew also received money from Banque Havilland, though the BBC didn't find evidence of this in the latest batch of Epstein files.
There have been many questions about Andrew's finances - and about his long-standing relationship with the banker Rowland.
Jonathan Rowland did not deny to the BBC that he or his father or Banque Havilland might have paid or lent money to Andrew or Ferguson, but denied that he had ever provided money in exchange for access to contacts.
In May 2010, Andrew appears to mention Rowland in an email to Epstein: ""You should know that I was seeing David Rowland, my trusted money man whom you know from a long time ago.""
Rowland and his son Jonathan had a close relationship with Andrew, joining him on trips in his capacity as an official trade envoy, to places such as China and the former Soviet states.
One email suggests Andrew was keen for one of Epstein's contacts to invest in the Rowlands' venture.
But Epstein was wary.
""He is actively seeking high net worth individuals for his Private Bank. Perhaps this is an avenue for your undecided Chinese?"" Andrew apparently writes to Epstein, in October 2010.
Epstein replies: ""His bank just might be the place.. I guess i should learn more.""
However, a few months earlier a contact of Epstein had raised concerns about Rowland's reputation, mentioning that he was referred to in the press as a ""shady financier"".
The phrase was first used in Parliament, and could therefore be repeated by journalists without risk of libel.
""He resigned his post as Tory treasurer last Thursday before he started,"" the contact warns.
""Before he started?? what?"" Epstein replies.
A reply suggests that ""PA"" explained that Rowland ""decided not to take up the appointment. For numerous reasons not least to the internal situation in the party.""
Another email suggests that Epstein was going to have dinner with Andrew, David and Jonathan Rowland in Hong Kong that year. But he appeared reluctant to commit to any business ventures.
Epstein's associate writes to him in 2011: ""Jonathan Rowland asked me to join his new fund to invest in China, Russia, CIS [former Soviet countries] & Europe. He will send me material this week. I said I am very busy but will look at it. You need to tell me what you want me to do with this but I am working on the assumption to stay far away from it.""
Jonathan Rowland admitted meeting this associate, but says he never mentioned Epstein.
The same year, an email to Epstein from an associate notes that ""[Prince Andrew] was under scrutiny for dealing with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan (but government approved!), he has full support of his Mum [the Queen].""
The emails suggest the closeness of Andrew to David Rowland, including that he was at Andrew's birthday party.
David Rowland was a guest at the wedding of Andrew's daughter Princess Eugenie and Rowland had acted as Andrew's official representative at a funeral in London in 2015.
The Epstein files also include a photo of an article from the Telegraph website, showing a montage of David Rowland, Andrew and Epstein side-by-side. The story claims that Rowland had paid off around £85,000 of Sarah Ferguson's debts, and that Epstein had paid off other debts.
Epstein sent the photo to a contact listed simply as ""Rowland"", who appears not to have responded. Jonathan Rowland said he and his father had never seen it before.
Author Andrew Lownie, who wrote the book Entitled about Andrew, described his links to David Rowland as ""essential in understanding how Andrew was able to make so much money"".
He claims that Rowland played a ""crucial role in helping Andrew to monetise his royal status and government position as trade envoy"".
Jonathan Rowland denied that he or his father had used contacts from his travels with Andrew to promote business deals and investments.
Andrew has always denied wrongdoing and rejected claims that he had used his envoy role for his own personal gain.
Sarah Ferguson and Banque Havilland's successor organisation Rangecourt did not respond to requests for comment.

Sir Elton calls press intrusion into his baby son 'truly sickening',2026-02-06T12:45:24.886Z," Amy WalkerandBruce Thain
High Court
","Sir Elton John has said it was ""truly sickening"" to learn of how the Daily Mail breached his family's privacy in relation to the birth of his son Zachary, the High Court has heard.
In a witness statement, Sir Elton described the press intrusions - which also included article's about his own health - as ""outside even the most basic standards of human decency"".
The musician and his husband David Furnish are among seven people, including Prince Harry, Elizabeth Hurley and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, suing the publisher of the newspaper and the Mail on Sunday for breaches of privacy.
Their publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), denies all allegations of unlawful information gathering.
The star gave evidence on Friday appearing at the High Court via a video link in a green suit, blue shirt and tie.
He told the court the legal case brought by him and Furnish ""contains the most horrendous things in the world that you can ever suffer from a privacy point of view"".
The couple's claim relates to 10 articles published between 2002 and 2015, which they have said were based on unlawful information gathering.
In his statement, Sir Elton said he felt ""passionately"" about ""how wrong it is that such gross invasions could have been inflicted upon us and our family and friends without us ever knowing"".
""I have found the Mail's deliberate invasion into my medical health and medical details surrounding the birth of our son Zachary abhorrent and outside even the most basic standards of human decency,"" he wrote in his statement.
Sir Elton said that while he had devoted his life to music, ""this does not mean deeply personal things which I have a right to deal with in private are fair game"".
He described what he called the ""exploitation of love, connection, trust and bonds to find out information shared in confidence"", and said the ""invisibility of such evil acts"" meant he and Furnish were unable to detect them.
Addressing the High Court, he said he and Furnish took legal action against ANL because they were ""outraged"".
Asked by Catrin Evans KC, representing ANL, if it was true that the couple did not complain at the time the stories were published, Sir Elton said ""I can't remember"".
He added: ""We did not know the extent of the seriousness of what had gone on. When we knew the seriousness of what had gone on, we took action, because we were outraged.""
On Thursday, Furnish told the court that one story, published in December 2010, included the publication of their son Zachary's birth certificate before they had received it.
ANL's lawyers have argued the story was ""entirely legitimately"" sourced from previously published reports, the local registrar's office and a statement from a surrogacy agency.
Evans suggested that information had been put in the public domain before the Mail published its article, but Sir Elton described Zachary's birth as like an ""army manoeuvre"".
""We kept it quiet, which was a miracle considering who we are,"" he added.
Evans also told the court that an article with the headline ""Sick Elton cancels more tour dates"" in November 2009 followed a statement on his website.
In response, Sir Elton said: ""That may be the case but we didn't disclose in the statement on the website my illness or why I was cancelling the tour.""
He added that journalists were ""presuming I had something I didn't have"", but said ""I had something far more serious.""
Lawyers for ANL said in written submissions that the social circles of most of the claimants in the overarching case were ""leaky"".
They added that Sir Elton's spokesman at the time of the articles had ""regularly provided the media, including Associated journalists, with information about their lives"", including health information.
Sir Elton told the court the spokesman no longer works for him, and that his friends ""do not talk to the press and that is why they are still my friends"".
The court case has been adjourned until Monday.

Son of Robert Mugabe arrested in South Africa on suspicion of attempted murder,2026-02-19T16:29:25.118Z," Nobuhle Simelane
JohannesburgandDamian Zane
","Police in South Africa have arrested the youngest son of Zimbabwe's late former President Robert Mugabe, who is facing a charge of attempted murder after a reported shooting at a property in an upmarket suburb of Johannesburg.
Bellarmine Mugabe, 28, was taken into custody after a 23-year-old man, believed to be a gardener, was shot and injured.
Officers searching the house in Hyde Park, where Mugabe was staying, have found bullet cartridges but no firearm, police have said.
Bellarmine Mugabe is the youngest son of Robert and his second wife Grace Mugabe. Robert Mugabe, who died in 2019, led Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced out of power at the age of 93 in 2017.
One other man has been arrested alongside Bellarmine Mugabe as investigators continue their work, police spokesperson Col Dimakatso Nevhuhulwi said.
The pair are expected to appear in court ""soon"", according to a police statement.
Police are not yet officially naming Bellarmine Mugabe as one of those arrested, but reporters at the scene saw him in handcuffs and he has been widely named by local media.
The victim is in hospital and in a critical condition after being shot once, the spokesperson added.
In a briefing outside the property, Nevhuhulwi said the two suspects have not ""told us where the gun is, they are not saying anything about the gun"".

"Over 1,000 Kenyans enlisted to fight in Russia-Ukraine war, report says",2026-02-19T13:55:23.029Z," Wycliffe Muia
Nairobi
","A total of 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight for Russia, according to a Kenyan intelligence report that details a network of rogue officials allegedly colluding with human trafficking syndicates.
The report, submitted to parliament on Wednesday by Kenya's National Intelligence Service (NIS), said 89 Kenyans were on the front lines of the Russia–Ukraine war as of February this year.
At least one Kenyan has died, while several others have returned home injured or traumatised, it added.
The Kenyan government, which previously estimated that about 200 of its nationals had been recruited to fight for Russia, wants Moscow to bar the conscription of Kenyan soldiers.
Presenting the report to MPs, parliament majority leader Kimani Ichung'wah, revealed what he termed a ""deeply disturbing"" network of rogue state officials allegedly colluding with human trafficking syndicates to recruit and transport Kenyans to fight in the Russia–Ukraine war.
The spy agency detailed how recruitment agencies have allegedly been colluding with rogue Kenyan airport staff, immigration officers, officers at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), anti-narcotics officers and National Employment Authority officers to facilitate recruits' travel.
Ichung'wah alleged that the agencies had also been colluding with staff at the Russian embassy in Nairobi and the Kenyan embassy in Moscow to help recruits get Russian visas.
In a statement on Thursday, the Russian embassy in Nairobi dismissed the allegations as ""dangerous and misleading"", saying that its staff has never been involved in ""rogue schemes"" or engaged in illegal enlistment.
""At no point in time throughout the ongoing crisis in Ukraine [has] the Embassy ever issued visas to Kenyan citizens who sought to travel to Russia with the stated pose of participating in the Special Military Operation (SMO) in Ukraine.
""Nor the Embassy been encouraging any Kenyan citizen to do so.""
The embassy added that while it does not recruit foreigners, Russian law allows foreign nationals who are legally in Russia to voluntarily enlist in their armed forces.
While in parliament, Ichung'wah said that Kenya's ambassador to Moscow ""must be able to identify the officers within the embassy that may have colluded with these criminals. Our embassy must be beyond reproach. It must be the place where Kenyans can seek refuge, not exploitation.""
""Government offices are not to be used for criminal activities,"" he added.
The BBC has asked the Kenyan foreign ministry for comment.
The report did not say what had happened to the majority of the recruits but said that in addition to those on the front line, another 35 had been sent to military camps in Russia, 39 are injured and 28 are missing.
According to the investigation, ex-military personnel, ex-police officers and unemployed Kenyans aged 20–50 are the main targets of the recruiters.
Recruits are promised a monthly pay of up to 350,000 Kenyan shillings ($2,400; £2,000), with bonuses ranging from KSh 900,000 to KSh 1.2 million ($6,200–$8,300;£5,200–£7,000).
However, upon arrival, many reportedly find themselves deployed to front-line combat roles after minimal military training.
""They are told you are going to work as a guard… only to get there and you are taken to military camps,"" Ichung'wah said.
""You've only trained for three weeks. They are basically just giving you a gun to go and die,"" he added.
Those undergoing explosives and weapons training are only required to attend training for nine days before being sent to the front line, the report said.
Ichung'wah said that, initially, recruits departed through Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) using tourist visas and travelled through Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
However, with heightened surveillance at JKIA, traffickers reportedly changed tactics, rerouting victims through South Africa, Uganda and other neighbouring states.
The report identified some of the rogue agencies behind the recruitment of Kenyans and the medical facilities used for testing.
Authorities say several suspects, including the alleged mastermind, remain under active investigation, with further arrests expected. Investigations continue as officials seek additional suspects and work to rescue Kenyans still caught in the conflict.
Speaking to the BBC last week, Kenya's Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said Nairobi had shut down more than 600 recruitment agencies suspected of duping Kenyans with promises of jobs overseas.
Mudavadi said Kenya was working closely with Russia on curbing illegal recruitment practices, including discussions on visa policy and bilateral labour agreements excluding military conscription.
The foreigner minister is due to visit Moscow next month to discuss the matter.
So far 27 Kenyans who had been fighting in Russia have been repatriated, he said, with authorities providing psychological care to address their trauma and ""de-radicalise"" them.
Pressure has been mounting on the Kenyan government to act after the recent discovery of more bodies of nationals of African countries who had been recruited to fight for Russian armed forces.
Last November, Ukraine's foreign minister said that more than 1,400 people from 36 countries in Africa had been recruited to fight for Russia.
Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.
Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.

Islamic police in Nigeria arrest nine Muslims for not fasting during Ramadan,2026-02-19T10:51:03.401Z," Mansur Abubakar
Abuja
","The Islamic police in Nigeria's northern state of Kano arrested nine Muslims on Wednesday who were seen eating food during the first day of this year's Ramadan fast.
Kano has a majority Muslim population, where an Islamic legal system - Sharia - operates alongside secular law.
The Islamic police, known as the Hisbah, search cafes, restaurants and markets every year during Ramadan to ensure Muslims are adhering to the fasting hours. Some establishments stay open in areas of Kano where many Christians live.
For Muslims, eating is prohibited between sunrise and sunset. Fasting is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which lay the basis for how Muslims are required to live their lives.
Hisbah's deputy commander general Mujahid Aminudeen told the BBC that the nine detained - seven males and two females - had feigned ignorance that Ramadan had begun.
""We have arrested them and they are with us where we are going to be teaching them the importance of fasting, how to pray, read the Quran and become better Muslims,"" he said.
It is not clear when the Hisbah plans to free them. In similar cases in the past, officers have got in touch with the families of those detained to make sure there is proper monitoring after their release so that they fast to the end of the month.
Just over two decades ago, Sharia was introduced to work alongside secular law in 12 of Nigeria's northern states that all have a majority Muslim population.
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and has a special significance in Islam.
It is during this month that Muslims believe the first verses of the Quran - Islam's holy book - were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.
Every year, Ramadan is expected to last between 29 or 30 days. In Nigeria, fasting started on Wednesday 18 February and it is predicted to end on either 21 or 22 March.

Islamist militants accused of killing 34 in raids on Nigerian villages,2026-02-19T14:33:19.218Z," Mansur Abubakar
Abuja
","At least 34 people have been killed in coordinated attacks by suspected Islamist militants on several villages in north-western Nigeria, officials have told the BBC.
The gunmen launched simultaneous assaults on multiple communities in a remote border district of Kebbi state on Tuesday, overwhelming local defences and forcing residents to flee their homes.
Survivors described the attackers as highly organised, saying they swept through villages firing indiscriminately at residents.
Officials have blamed the relatively new insurgent group Lakurawa, which is known to operate in the area. It was targeted by US air strikes in December further north, in Sokoto state.
Security forces have now moved into the area to protect communities and assist survivors. Tracking operations are under way to cut off the militants' escape routes.
Authorities are yet to officially comment on the attacks, although images of shrouded corpses being prepared for burial have been circulating on social media.
The attack has sparked outrage among Nigerians online, with many calling on the government to end the violence that has become all too common in parts of the country.
Nigerian authorities officially declared Lakurawa a terrorist organisation last year and banned it across the country after reports emerged that its fighters were flogging people for listening to music.
Officials say Lakurawa is affiliated with jihadist factions in Mali and Niger. Its militants have for years settled in communities along the Nigeria-Niger border, marrying local women and recruiting young people into their ranks.
The group has previously carried out similar raids in Kebbi, using coordinated simultaneous attacks to swamp local defences.
The emergence of Lakurawa adds to Nigeria's already complex security challenges, as the government continues to battle multiple armed groups, from Boko Haram Islamists in the north-east to heavily armed kidnapping gangs operating across the north-west and central states and separatists in the south-east.

Lion DNA helps convict poachers for first time,2026-02-20T00:23:10.104Z," Angus Crawford
BBC News Investigations
","Lion DNA has been used to successfully prosecute poachers for the first time in the world, it has emerged.
Wildlife crime experts have only just revealed how they were able to identify the individual animal from body parts found in a suspect's village, as they matched a profile on Zimbabwe's lion database.
A blood sample had previously been taken from the male lion, which was being tracked by authorities in Hwange National Park - using a radio collar.
Two poachers were convicted for the 2024 incident and sent to prison in what is thought to be the first prosecution of its kind.
The details of the convictions and the role the DNA database played have been previously unknown.
Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Traffic, which works to combat the illegal trade in wildlife, has shared the detail with us.
In May 2024, authorities in Hwange National Park became suspicious after a radio collar worn by a male lion stopped working.
Investigators and police traced its last known position and found a snare with lion fur attached to it.
After collecting forensic evidence they questioned two men in a nearby village and discovered three sacks of meat, 16 lion claws and four teeth. These body parts would later be tested against the database, with the DNA from all matching the profile of that missing lion.
But possessing lion parts is not necessarily a crime in Zimbabwe.
Having them can be explained away as old, traditional ornaments or as coming from an animal that died of natural causes.
This has been an obstacle to prosecutions in the past.
But thanks to a breakthrough in DNA profiling, that's now changed.
The lab generated a DNA profile from the recovered body parts and compared this to the profile previously generated from a blood sample of the lion with the radio collar.
The two profiles matched and scientists were able to identify the specific missing animal.
Over the last eight years the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust (VFWT) has received about £250,000 from the People's Postcode Lottery in the UK to build up the DNA database of lions in Zimbabwe.
The scientist at the trust, who made the discovery, asked to remain anonymous for his own safety, but said:
""Before we had access to this technology, we were only able to do species identification, but sometimes that's not enough.
""We can essentially match those claws or those products to the lion of interest that we are looking for.""
Within 10 days of the killing, the DNA evidence was presented in court.
Two men pleaded guilty and were given 24 month prison sentences.
The hearing was told the value of the lion was about $20,000.
Richard Scobey, Traffic's executive director, said ""countries now have the forensic capability to bring, solid science-based evidence to court"" and that it will have global impact.
This is understood to be the first time that DNA from an individual lion has been identified and used to prosecute poachers.
Professor Rob Ogden has been closely involved in setting up the project and is co- founder of the organisation Trace, which promotes the use of forensic science in wildlife law enforcement.
He says the prosecution gives ""a message of hope"" and shows what can be done using a combination of training, research and development and forensic casework.
Recent figures suggest an increase in the number of lions being killed for their body parts which are then sold both as cultural objects in Africa and for traditional Chinese medicine.
It is thought the rise may be down to organised crime gangs also involved in the illegal trade in Rhino horn and ivory trafficking.
In Mozambique between 2010 and 2023, 426 lions were killed as a result of contact with humans with a quarter linked to deliberate poaching.
A measure of the scale of the trade is also the number of seizures by the authorities in recent years.
That includes 17 lion skulls found in Lusaka in 2021, reportedly en-route from South Africa, and a 2023 seizure in Maputo of more than 300kg of lion body parts.
Which is why this breakthrough on DNA identification is seen as sending an important message to would-be poachers.

"Sudan atrocities are 'hallmarks of genocide', UN says",2026-02-19T16:38:50.681Z," Barbara Plett Usher
Africa correspondent
","A UN fact-finding mission has determined that evidence of atrocities carried out during the siege and takeover of the Sudanese city of el-Fasher points to genocide.
The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) captured el-Fasher, located in the western region of Darfur, at the end of October after an 18-month blockade.
It was one of the most brutal chapters in Sudan's nearly three-year civil war and triggered widespread international outrage.
This is the closest the UN has come to declaring that genocide is being carried out by RSF fighters in Darfur during the current conflict. The RSF has not commented on the report but has denied previous such accusations.
""The body of evidence we collected — including the prolonged siege, starvation and denial of humanitarian assistance, followed by mass killings, rape, torture and enforced disappearance, systematic humiliation and perpetrators' own declarations - leaves only one reasonable inference,"" said fact-finding mission expert Mona Rishmawi. ""The RSF acted with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Zaghawa and Fur communities in El-Fasher. These are the hallmarks of genocide.""
The report concludes that at least three underlying acts of genocide were committed, including killing members of a protected ethnic group; causing serious bodily and mental harm; and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction in whole or in part.
The investigators were not able to visit el-Fasher but based their report on more than 320 interviews with survivors, statements from RSF commanders and verified videos and satellite images.
Calling the findings ""truly horrific"", UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she would take the report's conclusions to the UN Security Council on Thursday.
In a statement she said there must be international criminal investigations to ensure accountability for perpetrators and justice for victims, and an end to the arms flow feeding the conflict.
Sudan's civil war erupted in April 2023 out of a power struggle between the regular army and the RSF over how and whether the paramilitaries would integrate into the security forces. It evolved into a country-wide conflict fuelled by longstanding local grievances and ethnic divisions.
Both sides have been accused of committing human rights abuses and war crimes.
In the Darfur region, Arab militias that form the backbone of the RSF have targeted non-Arabs they see as enemies, using savage tactics also employed some 20 years ago. At that time, they massacred hundreds of thousands of Darfuris from indigenous African ethnic groups, employed by the country's then authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir to put down local rebellions.
The report says the city was deliberately starved and destroyed during the long siege, which systematically weakened the ""targeted population"" and left them defenceless against the extreme violence that followed.
""Thousands of persons, particularly the Zaghawa, were killed, raped or disappeared during three days of absolute horror,"" it says, as RSF troops failed to distinguish between Zaghawa civilians and the armed groups defending the city.
Investigators described RSF conduct in el-Fasher as an aggravation of earlier patterns but on a far more lethal scale, noting that this demonstrates the failure to prevent the atrocities despite clear warning signs. They say without prevention and accountability, the risk of ""more genocidal acts remains serious and ongoing"".
The mandate issued by the Human Rights Council in Geneva called on the investigative team to ""identify, where possible"" suspected perpetrators in a bid to ensure they are ""held accountable"".
The report names RSF Leader Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (widely known as Hemedti) and spokesperson Lt Col Al-Fatih Al-Qurashi, citing the way they publicly claimed and celebrated the operation.
It notes that General Hemedti acknowledged some ""violations"" had occurred during the takeover of the city but that while he described el-Fasher as a ""catastrophe"", he justified the assault as necessary.
The RSF leader also issued instructions for his fighters not to harm civilians or kill prisoners, and he promised investigations. But investigators say the RSF did not respond to the mission's request to clarify the steps it had taken, or any other questions.
""The scale, coordination, and public endorsement of the operation by the senior Rapid Support Forces leadership point to a planned and organised operation executed through an established hierarchy and structure, rather than isolated acts,"" the UN mission said.
The report names one one notorious commander known as ""Abu Lulu"" who was arrested after viral footage of his brutality surfaced, but said the RSF had provided no information regarding any judicial proceedings.
It also says that despite their best efforts, the UN mission did not receive cooperation from Sudanese authorities. Yvette Cooper called obstructions ""from both warring parties... shameful and unacceptable"".
The mission's mandate did not include an investigation into the role of external actors who may be supporting the RSF.
But crucially the report notes that the RSF's military campaign was reinforced by foreign mercenaries equipped with ""advanced weaponry and communications systems"".
It says investigators are engaging with several states regarding ""credible information"" that they are involved and will report on this matter in the future.
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is widely reported to be the main backer of the RSF, although it continues to forcefully deny this, despite extensive evidence from international investigations that the UN has previously described as credible.
Abu Dhabi's role came under increased scrutiny after the el-Fasher massacre, but there was no public pressure on the UAE from the UN, the US or the UK.
The Emirati foreign ministry condemned ""in the strongest terms the grave violations"" documented by the investigators but also condemned what it said were atrocities committed by the Sudanese armed forces.
It underlined that the fact-finding report made no mention of Abu Dhabi and said it provided no support for the ""baseless claims associating the UAE with violations of international law in Sudan"".
The investigators called on the international community to fully enforce the existing arms embargo on Darfur and expand it to the rest of the country; to prevent the transfer of weapons and other support to parties implicated in serious violations; to ensure accountability through targeted sanctions; to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Court; and to consider the establishment of a judicial mechanism working in tandem with it.
Cooper said it was important that the fact-finding mission planned to conduct further investigations into reported breaches of the arms embargo and agreed that it should be extended and enforced.
She said she planned to highlight the systematic and widespread sexual violence which she calls ""a war against women's bodies"".
""Most important of all we need global action and pressure in pursuit of a ceasefire, and essential humanitarian access with support for survivors,"" she said.
The UN Security Council session is aimed at pushing for progress on a humanitarian truce, which has been elusive despite the enormous civilian suffering. The warring parties both frame the conflict as an existential battle and are able to continue fighting with increasingly sophisticated weapons supplied by their foreign backers.
""The world is still failing the people of Sudan,"" Cooper said. ""When the stories started to emerge about the horrors of el-Fasher it should have been a turning point, but the violence is continuing. Today, in the Security Council, the UK as President will make sure the world does not look away.""

The two farms in Senegal that supply many of the UK's vegetables,2026-02-19T00:16:54.144Z," Dan Saladino
Business reporter
Saint-Louis
","If you ate a corn on the cob, green beans or some spring onions in the UK this winter, chances are it would have come from one of two farms at the edge of the Sahara, in the north of Senegal.
The West African nation is becoming an important player in the UK's food supply. Is that a good thing?
Hidden behind green leaves and thick stalks you can hear Diarra at work before you see her.
The cobs of corn she's harvesting are so abundant and the plants so tall, she's almost lost in a sea of maize. And the job at hand is tough.
This far north in Senegal, so close to the desert, temperatures can exceed 35C at this time of the year, and there's little or no rainfall.
Working at speed and with sunhats on, Diarra and her team of pickers make a steady sound of rustling, followed by a thud-thud, as they strip the cobs off each plant and place them in soft buckets strapped to their backs.
Within an hour, the cobs will be inside a refrigerated pack-house and chilled down to 0C. Soon after, they'll be driven by truck to a port near the capital, Dakar, and loaded onto a container ship. Six days later, they'll be on sale inside a British supermarket.
Diarra is one of 9,000 employees, mostly women, working on two British-run farms in Senegal's Saint-Louis region.
Between January and March, if you browse the fresh produce aisles of the UK's biggest food retailers, including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Aldi and Lidl, you're likely to see spring onions, radishes, green beans, chillis, butternut squash, and cobs of corn, all labelled Produce of Senegal.
The hot climate and sandy, parched soil make this an unlikely place for fruit and vegetables – or so you might think.
And yet, it's from here, at the edge of the desert, two of the UK's biggest fresh produce businesses - G's Fresh and Barfoots - are growing an increasing amount of food.
The origins of the farms go back to the early 2000s. Back then, French entrepreneur and agronomist Michael Laurent began using Google Earth to identify new locations for food production.
Saint-Louis, he realised, has an abundance of sunlight, land and labour. And, although there is little rainfall, the 1,600km (1,000-mile) long Senegal River forms its northern border with the neighbouring country of Mauritania, before emptying into the Atlantic.
Some of this river water is diverted into a maze of canals. A network of pumps and pipes then distributes the water across miles of arid land to irrigate the farms that have helped to green the desert.
""There was nothing here when we started,"" says Laurent. ""It was all bush."" Now the farms cover 2,000 hectares of the land, the equivalent of almost 3,000 football pitches.
On 500 of these hectares, salad specialist, Cambridgeshire-based G's Fresh, runs its Senegalese subsidiary, West African Farms.
Each week, during the British winter, it supplies two million bunches of spring onions, 100 tonnes of green beans and 80 tonnes of radishes. Some 70% is sold to UK supermarkets, the rest goes to retailers in Germany and the Netherlands.
The larger farm is a joint venture between Sussex-based Barfoots and SCL, the business founded by Michael Laurent.
This supplies the UK with 55 million cobs of corn each year, along with chillis, butternut squash, and also green beans.
The harvested vegetables go by road to the deep-water Port of Dakar five hours away by road. From there, one day a week, a large container ship departs on the 3,000-mile journey to Poole in Dorset.
The UK imports around 40% of its food, but for fresh produce during the winter the proportion of imports can be as high as 90%.
Until recently, the bulk of the UK's imports of fruit and vegetables came from southern Europe and Latin American countries such as Peru, while airfreighted produce, including green beans, came from East Africa.
West Africa is like the new kid on the block. Several factors are driving this, says Mike Knowles, an analyst specialising in fresh produce.
""Competition for land around the Mediterranean has become more intense, droughts in Spain have become more frequent, and flying vegetables across continents has fallen out of favour,"" he explains.
Also, as Brexit took away some of the advantages of importing food from continental Europe, Senegal became increasingly more appealing.
Politically and economically, the country is relatively stable. It's the only nation in West Africa which hasn't experienced a military coup or seen its government overthrown.
Overseas businesses aren't allowed to buy land, but it is possible to arrange long-term leases through agreements with the government and communities. Access to water is bought under licence though local management committees.
""We've been confident enough to invest around £70m in our Senegalese operation,"" says Julian Marks, group manager of Barfoot's.
And there's constant pressure for them to expand. ""British consumers expect to be able to buy the same types of produce all year round,"" he says.
Senegal helps fulfil this demand, but what's in it for the African nation?
The 9,000 jobs created so far across the two farms is significant. Unemployment among Senegal's 18 million population grew during the pandemic and has remained high, hovering around 19%, with young adults in rural areas most affected.
Senegalese land rights activist Elhadj ""Ardo"" Samba Sow used to see the arrival of the foreign-owned farms as a form of neo-colonialism. Now working in local politics, he's more positive about their presence, ""even if the jobs aren't so well paid"".
The majority of the workers employed on the farms are guaranteed the minimum wage for agricultural workers in Senegal of around 2,500 West African francs a day ($4.50; £3). Pickers such as Diarra receive bonus payments if they're fast and exceed daily targets.
While Senegal has recently seen a rise in its minimum wage, Micheal Laurent acknowledges that wages are ""not a lot"", but that ""profit margins are very low, and we need to remain competitive"".
The low wages are another reason why the farms in Senegal could see further expansion.
""When we grow spring onions in the UK, 60% of the cost is labour,"" says Derek Wilkinson, managing director at G's Fresh. ""In Senegal, labour counts for less than one third.""
Even factoring in the cost of transportation from West Africa, on current trends Wilkinson believes it will soon make economic sense to replace more UK production with imports from Senegal, even during the British peak summer growing season. ""It'll be down to the consumer to decide if they want to buy British or imported.""
But is it a good thing to ship vegetables all the way to the UK from Senegal. ""No,"" says Tim Lang, emeritus professor at City University, who first coined the term ""food miles"".
While transporting food by sea comes at a lower environmental cost than air freight, maritime shipping accounts for 3% of global greenhouse emissions.
""We should align our diets with the seasons as much as possible,"" says Lang, ""And instead of imports from Africa, we need to be exploring the wider range of crops that can be grown in the UK.""

How the tide turned against the leader of South Africa's second-biggest party,2026-02-17T01:07:00.293Z," Khanyisile Ngcobo
Johannesburg
","Serving in the South African government for the first time, the Democratic Alliance (DA) - perceived as primarily representing racial minorities - portrays itself as a squeaky clean party but has suffered a major blow after its leader John Steenhuisen became engulfed in several scandals.
This forced him to announce he will step down as party leader, opening the way for a potentially divisive contest between a black and white candidate to succeed him.
Race remains a major faultline in South Africa. The ending, 32 years ago, of the legalised form of racism, apartheid, that came with the rise to power of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) has not totally erased the divisions.
The ANC has remained in government ever since, with the DA joining it for the first time after the 2024 election failed to produce an outright winner.
The DA secured six ministerial posts in President Cyril Ramaphosa's cabinet, with Steenhuisen holding the agriculture portfolio.
As the former leader of the opposition, and now minister, Steenhuisen was caught between making the government work while trying to appease his supporters - and prove to them that he is delivering in government.
But the 49-year-old has faced intense criticism from farmers over his failure to contain the foot-and-mouth disease, which has devastated South Africa's livestock industry.
The executive chair of the Southern African Agri Initiative (SAAI), Theo de Jager, was quoted as saying that anyone who ""dares to voice criticism"" of Steenhuisen's handling of the outbreak is ""pushed out, excluded, isolated, targeted, and treated with suspicion"".
For the DA, such criticism is a major blow as it has long positioned itself as being far more democratic and competent than Ramaphosa's ANC. But it has now come under fire from one of its key constituencies - South Africa's mostly white farmers - many of whom vote for the centre-right DA or the right-wing Freedom Front Plus.
But more damaging for Steenhuisen was the financial scandal that he became embroiled in - possibly the first time that this has happened to a DA leader.
South Africa's Daily Maverick news site broke a story - that Steenhuisen had a default court judgment against him for unpaid personal credit card debt of almost 150,000 rand ($9,400; £6,700) - despite the fact that his annual salary was 2.69m rand ($168,000).
In response, Steenhuisen said: ""My personal finances have nothing to do with the Daily Maverick unless you can demonstrate that illegal funds or the proceeds of corruption or abuse of office or undue benefits have flowed into or out of my accounts.""
But the disclosure tarnished his reputation - and that of the party - as people questioned how a leader who could not manage his own finances could manage the nation's finances.
The scandal coincided with Steenhuisen getting Ramaphosa to sack Environment Minister Dion George, then the DA's federal finance chair.
While no official reason was given, various reports pinned his removal to his stance against wildlife trafficking.
Wildlife trafficking, particularly poaching, is a significant problem in South Africa and George was praised by conservation groups for his role in championing reforms in the conservation and environmental sector, particularly by calling for an end to captive lion breeding.
The EMS Foundation, which advocates for wildlife rights, said George's removal was a ""political execution"" and accused Steenhuisen of walking ""straight into the arms of the wildlife-breeding sector"" when he assumed the agriculture portfolio.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also raised concerns, particularly over the apparent close ties George's successor Willie Aucamp had with wildlife breeders and hunters.
George's detractors within the DA pushed back against this narrative, citing under-performance and bullying allegations as reasons for his removal, while dismissing concerns about Aucamp's appointment, saying it expects ""continued progress"" in conservation and anti-poaching efforts under his leadership.
The DA also announced that it planned to institute a disciplinary inquiry into allegations that George ""unjustifiably"" raised the salaries of staff in his ministerial office - something that further tarnished the party's reputation.
George denied the allegations and said he was the victim of a ""smear campaign"" aimed at covering up the actual reasons for his firing.
He then resigned from the party, but not before revealing that he had confiscated Steenhuisen's DA-issued credit card last year because ""the account could not be reconciled"", with spending on UberEats, car rentals and hotel accommodation.
Steenhuisen denied the allegations, and a DA inquiry cleared him of any wrongdoing.
It found that expenditure on the card had been ""fully reconciled"", and that the ""limited number of personal expenses had been adequately explained and reimbursed"".
But possibly reading the political tea leaves, Steenhuisen later announced that he would step down as DA leader at its congress in April.
He appeared upbeat as he addressed the media, looking nothing like a man being forced out, as he reflected on his political career and achievements.
Steenhuisen's first foray into politics came in 1999 when he was appointed a councillor in his home city of Durban, before rising to become party leader 20 years later.
His ascent had not been without scandal. In 2010 he was forced to resign as the DA leader for the KwaZulu-Natal region after it emerged that the married Steenhuisen was having an affair with a colleague's wife.
Steenhuisen managed to quickly bounce back from that and found his way to parliament just a year later.
In 2014, he became the DA's chief whip, working closely with the party's first black leader, Mmusi Maimane. The two formed a close bond that soured when Maimane resigned from the role in 2019. Steenhuisen replaced him.
Since then, the pair has often traded insults.
Political analyst Sandile Swana told the BBC that Steenhuisen should have never been the DA leader.
Swana mentioned his 2010 affair, public fallout with George and his alleged difficulties in managing his finances as examples of his poor leadership.
Political analyst Khanyi Magubane offered a different perspective, saying South Africans in general may view him as someone who was able to rise above party politics, but in the DA ""he will go down as a betrayer to many who wanted him to continue the position of a hardliner"" in the coalition government.
Elaborating on this, she said that Steenhuisen's good relationship with the ANC in government was the ""core issue"" that led him to announce that he would step down.
Magubane said that when Steenhuisen and his party joined the coalition government, ""there was almost an expectation that he would continue with the mandate of fighting for DA policies"".
""But the exact opposite started to happen,"" Magubane said.
This echoed George's sentiments in his resignation from the party; the aggrieved veteran accused the DA, through Steenhuisen, of being ""captured"" by the ANC.
The election result forced the DA and ANC, considered long-standing arch-rivals, to put aside their differences and work together.
The pro-business DA had been a fierce critic of the ANC on many issues, including foreign policy - where the ANC is seen to be too close to countries such as Russia - and domestic policy, where it champions affirmative action.
Despite numerous hurdles along the way, including the DA's refusal to support the government's proposed budget twice last year, both parties have so far managed to make the best of the uneasy union.
This was best exemplified when Steenhuisen backed Ramaphosa when the president was ambushed by US President Donald Trump at the Oval Office in May last year.
After Trump confronted the delegation with a video in support of discredited claims of a white genocide in South Africa, it was Steenhuisen who assured the US president that most white farmers wanted to stay in the country.
Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis has been viewed as a favourite to replace Steenhuisen at the party's elective conference, though local media is reporting that he could be challenged by the DA leader in the economic heartland of Gauteng, Solly Msimanga.
Analyst Magubane doubts Msimanga stands a chance of winning.
""As the Gauteng leader he has a lot of support, but Hill-Lewis still has the backing of senior party members like Helen Zille.""
She also reflected that, following Maimane's stint in the post, she does not think the ""DA has the appetite for a black leader at the moment"".
The DA has long been perceived as a party that promotes the interests of whites, Indians, and coloureds, as people of mixed race are known in South Africa.
Maimane stepped into the leadership post in 2015 as the DA was trying to broaden its appeal.
Four years later he quit after the party's vote declined by about 1.5 percentage points in the general election.
Explaining his exit at the time, Maimane said the DA was ""not the vehicle best suited to take forward the vision of building"" a united South Africa.
Breaking up the party's now white-dominated leadership will be hard, says Magubane, reflecting that the party needs ""to appease the conservative right made up of Afrikaners"".
""A black leader will not be supported by the conservatives in the party.""

Kenyans drop flowers for Valentine's bouquets of cash. Not everyone is impressed,2026-02-14T00:02:04.012Z," Basillioh Rukanga
NairobiandAnita Nkonge
BBC Africa
Nairobi
","For as long as many residents of Nairobi can remember, the Kenyan capital has been awash with red every 14 February.
On Valentine's Day, people are dressed in red, the colour of love and romance, or are carrying red roses.
Traders are quick to cash in, selling fresh blooms from local farms, as Kenya is one of the world's top producers of cut flowers.
Recently though, instead of the soft red petals, some people have been opting for the brown, blue or purple of crisp banknotes, folded, rolled or fastened together into floral-like bouquets.
The trend has spread to other African countries and has become so pervasive that it has drawn the concern of central banks in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Botswana and Namibia.
They have all issued public warnings against damaging or defacing banknotes when making these bouquets of cash.
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) says that in many instances, banknotes are ""glued, taped, stapled, pinned or otherwise affixed"".
Damaged notes can then be rejected by automated teller machines (ATMs) and cash‑sorting equipment, meaning they have to be withdrawn from circulation, at a cost to the taxpayer.
In its notice, the CBK said it was not opposed to the use of cash gifts - only to practices that damaged notes - an offence that could lead to creators of money bouquets being jailed for up to seven years.
Cash bouquets have been popularised by celebrities and online influencers, who often share videos of themselves presenting such gifts.
The celebrations are not limited to Valentine's Day - they extend to birthdays and other special occasions, meaning money bouquets are in demand throughout the year.
The bouquets come in various designs, with creators arranging the banknotes to suit the taste and budget of each customer.
The wads of cash used in such bouquets vary widely - they can amount to as little as 1,000 shillings ($8; £6) or as much as a million shillings, says Angela Muthoni, a florist at the Gift and Flowers shop in central Nairobi.
While many are created in floral designs, or a mix of flowers and money with elegant wrappings, they can also be part of cake designs or be given in gift boxes.
Muthoni says money bouquets have become popular in the last two years. In the run-up to Valentine's Day, she has been receiving orders of between 15 and 20 bouquets every day, despite the CBK's warning.
""Everyone loves money,"" she tells the BBC, adding that gifting people cash takes away the stress of choosing a present.
Some Kenyans, however, argue that it just shows that people are becoming more materialistic, seeking to buy love with money, rather than romance.
""It's some form of peer pressure,"" 24-year-old Haskell Austin tells the BBC.
He prefers giving flowers, describing the idea of gifting money as ""materialistic"".
But if cash must be given, he prefers a straightforward transfer instead of folding or decorating it into bouquets.
A woman who identifies herself only as Lynn is disappointed by the timing of the CBK's caution against making cash bouquets, coming just ahead of Valentine's Day, as she was looking forward to receiving one.
""People are still excited about the trend,"" she tells the BBC at Koinange Street, a popular spot for buying flowers in Nairobi.
""I would prefer cash,"" Nicole Rono tells the BBC. ""Who doesn't love money? Flowers are OK, yes, but now with what the CBK has said, you can still give cash without damaging it,"" she says.
For university student Benjamin Nambwaya, the fact that women are usually the recipients is based on social expectations.
He tells the BBC that the culture of giving money bouquets is a ""bad thing"" and can end up ""destroying relationships"", especially when it creates an expectation even when one cannot afford to give money.
He would prefer to give flowers.
""I think flowers are cool, because this is a small celebration or something just to show how how much you really adore this person,"" he says.
Economic expert Odhiambo Ramogi says it is all about ""our capitalistic approach to life"".
""Capitalistic societies are driven by advertising, by marketing and special days like Valentine's are a very good opportunity.""
For Muthoni, the florist, it comes down to how someone wants to express their love.
""Love people the way they want to be loved,"" she says, although she concedes that ultimately money is at the heart of it.
""You can buy a lot of things with money. You might not know what someone likes, but money is the solution.""
Discussions about money bouquets have been widespread on social media since the CBK's warning, drawing both praise and derision.
It has sparked some humour as well, such as memes of bouquets made from rolled chapati bread.
Speaking about the trend on TikTok, Kenyan Scott Ian Obaro said it may also have encouraged a culture of ""showing off"".
Ramogi argues that the idea of giving flowers is largely a foreign concept in Africa, which he says helps explain why the culture of gifting money is more readily embraced.
""The African hardly gave flowers,"" he says, adding that the practice is a Western tradition and that many Kenyans would prefer money ""to take care of a need"" rather than a flower given purely for sentimental reasons.
""But now it's combined with the fact that we are more materialistic. The natural flower has been replaced with the currency flower,"" he says.
The intervention by Kenya's regulator, along with those in other countries, may slow the culture of giving money bouquets.
Muthoni fears the move could lead to a loss of income for people who have built livelihoods around the bouquets, though she believes there is room for innovation.
She says she has designed bouquets with transparent pockets that can hold money without it getting damaged and is considering other ideas such as digital bouquets.
Some have switched to using US dollars, which would not be affected by the warning from Kenya's central bank.
So the money bouquet culture is unlikely to be nipped in the bud any time soon.

A simple guide to the crisis in South Sudan,2026-02-11T12:34:52.569Z," Farouk Chothia
Yemisi AdegokeandNichola Mandil
Juba
","Fears that South Sudan - the world's youngest nation - could plunge into a full-blown civil war have intensified as fighting continues in Jonglei state, north-east of the capital, Juba.
Government forces are trying to retake territory from those loyal to First Vice-President Riek Machar, who has been suspended from his post after being accused of plotting to overthrow President Salva Kiir.
Machar is currently on trial in Juba, on charges of murder, treason and crimes against humanity, which he denies.
His party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army In Opposition (SPLM/A-IO), has denounced the charges as a ""political witch-hunt"", and a move to ""dismantle"" a 2018 peace accord that ended a five-year civil war.
The SPLM/A-IO and allied groups have said they have been capturing territory, including military bases, in Jonglei and other states since the end of last year.
South Sudan's army responded with a counter offensive launched last month.
In a controversial statement, deputy army chief Gen Johnson Oluny urged his troops to ""spare no-one"" including ""children, the elderly, and civilians"" when they were deployed to Jonglei.
The government has clarified that this was not an order, saying it is committed to protecting civilians.
The recent fighting in Jonglei has forced at least 280,000 people to flee their homes.
Facilities run by aid agencies, including clinics, have been looted and staff beaten up, according to the charity Oxfam.
South Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries, gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of fighting led by the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM).
Just two years into independence, a civil war erupted when Kiir dismissed Machar as vice-president, accusing him of plotting a coup.
The ensuing conflict, largely fought along ethnic lines between supporters of the two leaders, resulted in an estimated 400,000 deaths and 2.5 million people being forced from their homes - more than a fifth of the population.
As part of the peace deal, Machar was reinstated as vice-president within a unity government that was meant to pave the way for elections.
While the current conflict in Jonglei is driven primarily by national political rivalries, the state has long been a hotspot for inter-communal violence, particularly between sub-clans of the Dinka and Nuer.
Cycles of violence linked to cattle raiding, land access, political representation and revenge attacks continue to shape and complicate the current conflict.
The SPLM/A-IO draws much of its core support from Nuer communities, while the government and its allied forces are dominated by Dinka leadership. As a result, national political confrontations often reignite unresolved local grievances, increasing the risk of communal violence.
The current crisis was sparked in March last year when the White Army militia, which was allied to Machar during the civil war, clashed with the army in Upper Nile state and overran a military base in Nasir.
Then on 7 March a UN helicopter attempting to evacuate troops came under fire, leaving several dead, including a high-ranking army general.
Nearly three weeks later, Machar and several of his associates were placed under house arrest. They were accused of trying to stir up a rebellion.
""The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,"" Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, deputy leader of SPLM/A-IO, said at the time.
Rather than defusing tensions, the government struck again, hitting Machar with a slew of charges - including treason, the ultimate crime against the state - in September.
Days later, his party ratcheted up the pressure, denouncing Kiir's government as a ""dictatorship"" and demanding ""regime change"".
Helicopter pilot recounts flying under gunfire in daring rescue mission
While Machar's inclusion in the unity government was a key part of the agreement, other parts of it have not been implemented.
The key issue for many South Sudanese is the security arrangement.
The deal outlined how former rebel forces and government soldiers would be brought together into a unified national army made up of 83,000 troops. The remainder were supposed to be disarmed and demobilised.
But this has not happened and there are still lots of militias aligned to different political groups.
The deal also outlined the establishment, with the help of the African Union, of a court meant to try the perpetrators of the violence. But this has not been created, in part because those holding some of the top positions in government are reluctant to set up something that could see them put on trial.
Elections that were supposed to happen in 2022 have still not taken place and neither has a new constitution been drawn up.
An attempt to revive the peace process by Kenyan mediators is being made.
Under what is known as the Tumaini Initiative - tumaini is Swahili for ""hope"" - the plan is for talks to be held in Kenya aimed at laying the groundwork for credible elections.
While Kiir and Machar, both in their 70s, were part of the SPLM that fought for independence, long-standing tensions exist.
These have been fuelled by ethnic divisions - Kiir is Dinka, while Machar is Nuer - and competing political ambitions.
When Kiir sacked Machar in 2013, triggering the civil war, Machar denounced him as a ""dictator"".
Creating further problems between the two are the repeated postponements of elections.
Polls have been delayed four times, leaving Machar unable to fulfil his presidential ambitions while perceptions grow that Kiir intends to be president-for-life.
Born in 1953, the 72-year-old was the 27th son of the chief of Ayod and Leer and was brought up in the Presbyterian Church.
As an undergraduate, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Khartoum and in 1984 earned a PhD in philosophy and strategic planning at the UK's Bradford University.
He switched sides on several occasions during the battle to secede from Sudan, as he sought to strengthen his position and that of his Nuer ethnic group.
He became vice-president of South Sudan at independence in 2011. Machar was sacked in 2013 and then reinstated as part of a deal in 2016, but then fled as fighting resumed.
Born in 1951, the 74-year-old devout Roman Catholic was the son of a cattle herder and the eighth of nine children.
At 17, he joined the Anyanya, one of the rebel groups that was fighting for southern independence during the First Sudanese Civil War in 1967. Sixteen years later - in the Second Sudanese Civil War - he was one of the five founding members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement.
The former rebel commander, who specialised in military intelligence, was seen as a moderate within the SPLM and became its leader in 2005 after the death of John Garang in a helicopter crash
He became president of South Sudan on independence and has remained in that position for 14 years as no elections have taken place.
Last year, Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, warned that the country was ""teetering on the brink of a return to full-scale civil war"", which would devastate the nation still dealing with the aftermath of the last conflict.
There are concerns that a return to fighting could lead to ""proxy warfare in the region"", according to Daniel Akech, an analyst at the Crisis Group think-tank.
Any conflict would have two main consequences, he added. ""First, the two sides will stoke ethnic grievances... as they seek to mobilise supporters and ready them for combat. Secondly, a flare-up in South Sudan is likely to draw in the country's neighbours.""
The leaders of the members of the regional grouping Igad - including Uganda - are supposed to be the guarantors of the 2018 deal.
Some Ugandan troops have been deployed to the country as part of what South Sudan's government said was a long-standing agreement to support the army.

Her sons were killed by Islamist militants. She's among thousands who had to flee,2026-02-11T08:27:13.071Z," Nicolas Négoce
BBC Africa
NioroniguéandAbayomi Adisa
BBC Africa
Lagos
","Warning: Readers may find some of the content distressing
Sitting in a dim room at a refugee camp in Ivory Coast, Yameogo Aminata, 57, is haunted by memories of the murder of her four sons by jihadists in her home country, Burkina Faso.
In 2022, she was away from her home when the armed insurgents - who have been terrorising communities in central Burkina Faso for almost 15 years - struck.
The jihadists had forcefully taken over her village, seizing cattle and land, and killing many residents - including her sons aged between 25 and 32.
""They slit the throats of four of my children,"" she told the BBC, her body shaking as emotions overwhelmed her.
""When I arrived, they were killing my fourth son.""
Aminata said she grabbed a knife to fight back, but was overpowered, beaten, thrown into the bush, and left with severe injuries to her head, shoulder and throat.
She said her daughter got separated from her during the attack, and she has been missing since then.
In 2023, Aminata fled to Nioronigué camp in neighbouring Ivory Coast, keeping the bloodied clothes from that day as a grim reminder.
""I don't know how to handle my life. I have nothing,"" she told the BBC.
At least 10,000 people have been killed in the insurgency in Burkina Faso, which also engulfs neighbouring Mali and Niger.
The United Nations has described the region as the ""epicentre"" of global jihadist violence.

Military juntas seized power in all three countries, promising to curb the insurgency.
They have moved away from their traditional allies in the West, and have turned to Russia for military aid.
Although Russian forces, under the banner of its Africa Corps, have been deployed in Burkina Faso, the insurgency has persisted, with the most powerful militant group being an al-Qaeda affiliate, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM).
Like Aminata, 60-year-old farmer Hassane Tall fled northern Burkina Faso in 2023 with his three wives and 19 children after enduring multiple attacks.
""We escaped clashes between jihadist groups and security forces,"" he said. ""We thought we would die.""
Now living in the Nioronigué camp, he said that leaving his ancestral land hurt him deeply, but he sees no future back home for his family.
The 12-hectare Nioronigué camp sheltering Aminata and Tall is close to the Burkina Faso border. It was established in 2023 by the UN and Ivorian authorities.
Designed for about 6,000 people, this camp and the nearby Timala camp now hold around 13,000 refugees - far beyond its capacity.
UN data shows that more than three million people have been displaced by various conflicts in the Sahel region.
More than 80,000 people from Burkina Faso now live in camps in Ivory Coast.
Expressing gratitude for being given shelter, Aminata said: ""I thank the state of Ivory Coast, and all the Ivorians.""
""I left my house because we were chased out by jihadists. They said that they want the country,"" she added.

Similar tales of lost loved ones and lingering trauma echo across the camp.
Some of the refugees are from Mali. They include a 27-year-old finance graduate. He and his brothers recently made a perilous journey in a wooden boat down the River Niger from Gao in northern Mali to the capital, Bamako, then took a bus to northern Ivory Coast for safety.
The graduate said they were forced to leave after their 24-year-old cousin was killed by suspected jihadists.
""He was a fisherman. He was coming from fishing at night as usual. He was attacked by two men riding motorbikes. These are things that happen every day.
""We were living in fear, not knowing if we'll wake up the next day,"" he told the BBC.
Ivory Coast's economy is one of the region's fastest growing, but unemployment and poverty remain high, with locals in border areas worried about the influx of refugees.
But government representative Djamatigui Touré told the BBC that refugees will not be turned away.
""Those who come are our brothers; we share the same history and culture,"" he said.
However, the UN Development Programme's resident representative, Blerta Cela, warned that resources are under severe strain.
""The number of refugees has increased tremendously. The majority of them are actually not in the camps. They are hosted by Ivorian families,"" she said.
For Aminata, starting again in a new country comes with the weight of memories from the life she left behind.
""I still cannot erase what happened to me,"" she said.
""We just pray to God that peace comes back to Burkina Faso.""

New video game sees Africans fantasise about taking back looted treasures,2026-02-10T00:47:00.258Z," Penny Dale
","Imagine it is 2099 and the Transatlantic Returns Treaty is falling apart as Western museums find ways to wriggle out of promises to return stolen African treasures.
Fed up with the trickery, artefacts expert Prof Grace decides to take matters into her own hands. And the South African knows the perfect people to help: her grandchildren, Nomali and Trevor and her former student Etienne.
In an abandoned warehouse in Johannesburg, Prof Grace sets out her high-stakes plan - to break into museums and private collections and take back artefacts mostly plundered during colonial times.
None of this is real - rather it is the narrative of Relooted, what its creators call an ""African-futurist heist game"", released on Tuesday.
But it's a heist story with a difference - there's no big pay day at the end of the heist and the characters don't have a criminal background.
They are motivated not by money - but by ever-shifting goalposts.
The latest amendment to the Transatlantic Returns Treaty means only artefacts on public display have to be returned - and Western museums are now busy wrapping up objects and putting them into storage.
Sports scientist Nomali is the mastermind - and the character through which the game is played, helped by colleagues from across the continent.
""Nomali reluctantly agrees to the first heist to prove how dangerous the whole thing is,"" the game's narrative director Mohale Mashigo told the BBC.
""She would do anything for her family - and she joins them as a way to protect them from themselves and the real danger that is involved in heists.""
Nomali is a parkour legend and uses those skills - running, jumping, climbing, and vaulting over obstacles - to retrieve 70 African sacred and cultural objects.
Her brother Trevor, a locksmith and security systems expert, helps her in and out of the buildings - with intel from The Inside Man, Etienne, who is Belgian-British.
Ndedi, from Cameroon, uses her acrobatic skills for the most elaborate escapes, Cryptic is the hacker from Kenya and Congolese Fred is the getaway driver and gadget maker.
During the twists and turns of the game, other characters emerge.
Relooted is designed by the pan-African team of Nyamakop studio in South Africa.
Its 2018 Semblance debut was the first African-developed game to launch on a Nintendo console.
Designers and voice actors in countries including Nigeria, Angola, Malawi, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya also worked on Relooted.
It is the first of what its CEO Ben Myres hopes will be a line of ""African-inspired games for a global audience.""
The action game, which uses motion captures and animated cinematics, is designed for PCs and consoles - which means that it won't attract many players in Africa, where most people play on smartphones because they are more affordable.
The core target audience is the African diaspora.
Sithe Ncube, the game's project manager, believes it will have a much wider appeal.
""Taking back cultural artefacts that were looted is actually something a lot of people hope for - and fantasise about,"" Ncube, who is from Zambia, told the BBC.
Myres came up with the idea for Relooted during a visit to London. His mother had gone to the British Museum, where she saw the Nereid Monument - an ancient tomb that had been dismantled and moved between 1842 and 1844 to the museum, brick by brick, from the south of Turkey.
""She was incensed, just really struck by the audacity of stealing a building and flippantly said: 'You should make this into a game',"" Myres told the BBC.
Myres used artefacts instead of buildings because ""I could never figure out how to make moving a building out of another building very fun.""
In a deliberate contrast to the violent way in which many African artefacts were taken, there's no violence in Relooted.
Players instead rely on solving puzzles, outsmarting systems, overcoming obstacles, teamwork and athleticism.
At the end of the game the players take the reclaimed artefacts to a real place, the Museum of Black Civilizations in Dakar, Senegal.
""It's sort of a staging point for where all the artefacts will eventually return to the people they were taken from,"" Myres says.
The artefacts in Relooted are based on real objects taken mostly by foreigners during the late 19th and 20th Centuries.
Though the game also features more recent thefts - like the sacred vigango carved grave markers from Kenya and Tanzania. A massive demand from Western art dealers encouraged a ""theft-to-order"" in the 1980s and 1990s - as happened a decade later with Dogon art from Mali.
Also up for grabs by Nomali and her crew is a 300,000-year-old skull found in what is now Zambia.
Kabwe 1, or Broken Hill Man, is one of the most significant human fossils ever found - and has been in the Natural History Museum in London since 1921, when it was discovered.
The Asante Gold Mask - which was looted when British troops destroyed the royal palace in Kumasi in 1874 - is now held by the Wallace Collection in London.
The Ngwi Ndem or Bangwa Queen, was removed from Cameroon in 1899. The wooden sculpture was once part of the extensive collection of African artefacts belonging to cosmetics pioneer Helena Rubinstein.
The 81cm (32 in)-tall statute was made into a pop culture icon in the 1930s by renowned artist Man Ray when he photographed it alongside a nude model.
To the Lebang people of south-western Cameroon, the Ngwi Ndem is more than a piece of art. It is a sacred lefem figure that represents the ancestors, symbolises fertility, prosperity and protection and was used in ceremonies.
There's no sign that the Dapper Foundation in France - which bought it at a Sotheby's auction in 1990 for $3.4m (£2.5m) - will return it as requested.
Formal demands for the return of some of Africa's best-known artefacts - the Benin Bronzes - were made as early as the 1930s by the Nigerian kingdom's then monarch, Oba Akenzua II.
He managed to get back two coral bead crowns and a tunic but it was only in 2021 that any significant repatriation of artefacts by Western universities and museums began.
It remains a trickle, however.
Nyamakop co-founder Myres is very clear that Relooted is first and foremost a form of entertainment.
But the South African also sees the game as a ""general awareness-raising attempt about African culture, African history, and sort of the scale of this cultural artefact looting that has happened"".
The unique nature of games makes them an ideal vehicle, explains Ncube.
""You must actively engage in games,"" she says.
""A lot of interactions are optional, and if you want to just play a fun game you can,"" she adds.
""But in order to achieve certain goals in a game, you always have to do and learn certain things.""
In Relooted, briefings about the artefacts are part of Nomali's mission.
Players also have the option to spend time learning more about the objects, their symbolism and the communities they belong to in the Hideout Room - which is modelled on the real Northcliff Water Tower overlooking the city of Johannesburg.
""I'm fairly certain that anyone who plays the game will come away with a new perspective,"" Ncube says.
""Whether it's about an unknown history, injustices that people are still waiting to be addressed or even the fact that people in Africa can make games that are at a global standard.""

A singer's tragic death highlights Nigeria's snakebite problem,2026-02-08T00:01:32.697Z," Mansur Abubakar
Abuja
","Ifunanya Nwangene was asleep last Saturday morning in her ground-floor apartment in Nigeria's capital city when she was awoken at around 08:00 by a searing pain on her wrist.
""A snake came up on her bed and bit her,"" Ifunanya's father Christopher Nwangene told the BBC's Newsday programme.
He was relating the events that led to his daughter's tragic death, which has raised serious concerns about how hospitals deal with snakebites, and the availability of antivenom across Nigeria, which has the world's third-highest incidence of snakebites.
Ifunanya, a well-known soprano singer in Nigeria - finding fame a few years ago on the local version of the TV competition The Voice, knew she had to get antivenom at a hospital as soon as possible.
Her father said she also applied a tourniquet, tying a piece of rope tightly around her arm.
This used to be the recommendation for snakebites to stop the venom spreading through the body - though this is no longer the advice as a tourniquet, which stops the flow of blood, can cause tissue damage and increase the risk of amputation.
Instead, snakebite victims are told to keep calm, immobilise an affected limb and seek emergency medical care immediately.
But it is hard not to panic when one arrives at a hospital to find there is no antivenom, which happened to Ifunanya, meaning she had to go to another one.
The 26-year-old singer phoned her father when she later got to Abuja's Federal Medical Centre, Jabi - and he then called his brother, who lives in the capital, to go and check on her.
She was not in a good way when her uncle got to the hospital - her tourniquet had been removed and she was put on a drip.
""Immediately they gave her the drip, the little girl started going down immediately. She said: 'Daddy, I cannot speak,'"" Nwangene recalled.
Ifunanya's close friend, Sam Ezugwu, had also rushed to the hospital when he heard the news and told the BBC that some antivenom had been given to her, but more was needed.
""While they were trying to stabilise her, she could not speak but she could make hand gestures. She was struggling to breathe,"" said Ezugwu, who is music director of the Amemuso Choir where Ifunanya sang.
He went out looking for another vial of antivenom - as did her uncle.
This version of events has since been disputed by the Federal Medical Centre, Jabi, which has denied the antivenom was unavailable and said claims its response was inadequate were unfounded.
In Nigeria what is known as a ""polyvalent antivenom"" is usually used to treat snakebites, which means it can be used for bites from a variety of snakes.
The amount needed depends on the severity of the bite and the type of snake - with a vial currently costing between 45,000 naira ($33; £24) and 80,000 naira ($58; £43).
""They asked my brother to go and buy antivenom from [a] pharmacy,"" Nwangene said, explaining that he had to go to several places.
But when he found some, it was too late. Ezugwu also returned with a vial to find Ifunanya had died.
Nwangene feels the hospital authorities did not do enough for his daughter - and questions why they removed the tourniquet if they did not have the medication to treat her.
""They're not supposed to remove that thing. She has two hands,"" he said, expressing the view that an amputation is better than death.
""They were not serious initially, as my brother told me. They were not serious at all.""
Her death has prompted widespread grief and urgent questions about the country's readiness to tackle a persistent and lethal public health issue.
It has also shocked a nation where snakebites are often perceived as a rural danger.
Another of the singer's friends told the BBC that two snakes were later found in her apartment in an upmarket area of Abuja.
Videos circulated online showing a snake handler removing one of the long black snakes that had slithered into the building - with onlookers screaming.
It is seen raising its hood, revealing it to be a cobra - and its colouring suggests it was a forest cobra, which, according to the African Snakebite Institute, is one of 12 highly venomous species of snakes found in Nigeria.
In 2021, Nigeria's then-Health Minister, Olorunnimbe Mamora, stated that an average of 20,000 snakebites were recorded each year in the West African nation, describing the situation as having reached ""epidemic proportions"".
The crisis is compounded by a critical shortage of affordable antivenom, which needs to be stored in fridges - often impossible in areas with unreliable electricity.
Shuaibu Mohammed, who lives in the north-eastern state of Gombe, said he was lucky to survive a snakebite 15 years ago.
He was at boarding school when he stepped on a cobra in the playground. He was rushed to hospital, which luckily had enough antivenom to treat him.
But three years ago, the outcome for his sister Sadiya, a mother of two, was fatal.
""It was in the night - and she came out to use the toilet when the snake bit her,"" he told the BBC.
""We rushed her to the hospital but there was no antivenom,"" he told the BBC.
""We were told we could buy some from the neighbouring state of Plateau. We called a brother there to get it, but before the antivenom was transported to us, we lost her,"" he said.
It is a story Hafiz Aminu, from the northern state of Kaduna, knows all too well.
""I almost lost my life last year,"" the 36-year-old told the BBC.
""I was returning home after a football game when a cobra bit me. But when we got to the nearest hospital, we were told they didn't have any antivenom.
""So we quickly decided to seek traditional help from a healer.""
The herbalist gave him a concoction made from the bark of a plant - likely to have been that of the African custard apple, which is commonly used as a traditional medicine in Nigeria to treat snakebites.
A 2005 study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Ethnopharmacology showed the relative effectiveness of the rootbark of this plant in treating cobra venom on rats, stating that it helped reduce fevers and ""directly detoxified the snake venom used by 16-33%"".
Aminu said the herbalist rubbed some of the mixture on his foot, where he had been bitten, and he was told to drink the rest with the warning that it would make him feel nauseous.
""I was feeling very weak and was scared for my life. When the healer saw me two days later, he said I was lucky to be alive.""
The African Snakebite Institute warns that traditional remedies are not known to work against highly venomous snakes.
Experts point out that the widespread use of traditional healers for snakebites means that the true scale of the problem is not known, as many deaths will go unrecorded.
In response to Ifunanya's death, the Nigerian Senate has called on the health ministry and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac) to ensure the nationwide availability of safe, effective and affordable antivenoms.
However, the motion did not set a specific timeline for action.
""A snakebite kills one person every five minutes,"" said Elhadj As Sy, chancellor of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) and co-chair of the Global Snakebite Taskforce.
He called on governments to integrate snakebite treatments into core health strategies and ensure that antivenom was accessible.
""With real political commitment we can end these preventable deaths,"" he told the BBC.
There have also been breakthroughs that may one day lead to more affordable solutions.
Scientists from LSTM and the University of Sydney announced in 2024 that the blood thinner heparin could be repurposed as an inexpensive antidote for cobra venom.
At the time, University of Sydney's Prof Greg Neely envisaged it had the potential to be used like an EpiPen, a device carried by people with allergies at risk of death from anaphylactic shock. It delivers a shot of adrenaline, while a snakebite pen could inject heparin.
For Nwangene, medics on the frontline in Nigeria need more ""human sympathy"" when dealing with snakebite victims.
He added that Ifunanya's gifted voice had given him great happiness over the years.
""My daughter is a very, very gentle girl. When she was growing up, she has been singing in our church - very, very, very talented.
""Every morning when I wake up, I thank God on her for giving me such a child until this wicked world took her away from me.""

From Hollywood to the homeland: Why African countries are courting black American stars,2026-02-07T00:00:31.801Z," Wedaeli Chibelushi
","Although their forefathers were seized from West and Central Africa centuries ago, the bond between African-Americans and their ancestral home has been a lasting one.
For instance, Liberia, Africa's oldest republic, was founded by freed black American slaves in 1822. After Ghana became independent in 1957, a wave of black intellectuals and artists moved there from the US. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali subsequently paid high-profile visits to Ghana, while Guinea became home to Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael.
This transatlantic connection has ebbed and flowed over time - but in recent years, there has been a real resurgence, helped by the use of DNA tests.
A number of black American celebrities have sought the nationality of African countries - singer Ciara has become a citizen of Benin, rapper Ludacris and film star Samuel L Jackson are officially Gabonese, actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors are citizens of Guinea and musical icon Stevie Wonder has Ghanaian papers.
Just last week, wildly popular content creator IShowSpeed was approved for a Ghanaian passport after stopping in the country on a whirlwind African tour.
The celebs have, in most cases, flown out for elaborate citizenship ceremonies and tours of local beauty spots, all of which have been captured for glossy social media content.
Posting photos of her citizenship ceremony in Guinea, Meagan Good told her 7.8m Instagram followers last month: ""This is history in motion"".
Good, who has featured in films like Think Like A Man and Saw V, and her husband Majors, known for Creed and Marvel flick Ant-Man and the Wasp, became citizens after DNA testing traced their ancestry to Guinea.
""This recognition goes beyond titles, it is a homecoming and a reconnection to our Afrodescendant roots,"" said Good.
Messaging from the various African governments has echoed this sentiment.
""In conferring Ghanaian citizenship upon Stevie Wonder,"" former president Nana Akufo-Addo said at Wonder's 2024 ceremony, ""we not only extend our warmest embrace to a beloved son of Africa but also reaffirm our belief in the enduring spirit of pan-Africanism and the global African family"".
Ghana has long promoted its pan-African credentials - for a decade anyone whose ancestors came from Africa have been entitled to Ghanaian nationality, a policy that arguably inspired Benin to launch a similar scheme.
Ghana also launched the ""year of return"" in 2019, a buzzy initiative encouraging Africans in the diaspora to relocate there.
More than 1,000 African-Americans have done so in the past decade, according to Dr Erieka Bennet, ambassador for the Diaspora African Forum, which helps people relocate to Ghana.
""It is not only about romanticism,"" Marie-Roger Biloa, a Cameroonian journalist with a focus on West Africa, tells the BBC.
""It's all very much about how can we tap into the potential they have, the Americans.""
Tourism is an obvious motivator. Governments hope that social media posts from the stars will encourage other black Americans, a large group with a growing economic power, to visit and inject money into their countries.
Biloa notes that Benin's president, a former business tycoon, is keenly aware that his country's former role as a key departure point for slaves makes it a poignant destination for black Americans.
""President [Patrice] Talon has really started investing in cultural heritage, in a way to engage the African-Americans worldwide. He understood it could be an engine for a new form of tourism and a new branch of economy,"" she says, mentioning The Marina Project, a memorial and tourist complex being built in Ouidah, once one of Benin's main slave ports.
Positive publicity from stars like Ciara may also encourage diasporans to invest or buy property in Benin, as they have been doing in Ghana since the year of return.
Soft power is also an important factor - by promoting their culture and building a robust network around the world, countries like Benin, Guinea, Gabon and Ghana stand to gain global influence.
In this mission, celebrity citizens act as ambassadors, Francis Kpatindé, a Beninois lecturer at France's Sciences Po University, tells the BBC.
""Benin has no diamonds like the Democratic Republic of Congo, no petrol, nothing. We just have cotton, the ports and culture,"" he says.
The celebrity ambassadors are ""a way for us to be on the record, to be on-screen. Now it's working. You can go to the social networks. You see Benin everywhere,"" Kpatindé says.
Many people from the countries involved recognise the economic and political benefits of giving citizenship to black American celebrities, but others are more critical.
There is an underlying feeling that the stars are bypassing what can be, for those born in the countries, a cumbersome and costly process to get passports.
Taufic Suleman, a painter and decorator from Ghana, felt ""irritated"" when the foreign minister announced that IShowSpeed, who grew up in the US but has a Ghanaian mother, had been approved for a passport.
""It is really, really, really a bad precedent... why do people, your citizens, have to go through vetting? Sometimes others end up being denied,"" Suleman, aged 32, tells the BBC.
""You just can't hand out a passport to anyone just because the person is a celebrity.""
Following the foreign minister's announcement, Patrick Boamah, a member of the Ghanaian parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, told local broadcaster Channel One that IShowSpeed must follow the required legal procedures to get a passport, although the authorities ""may waive certain steps for him"".
Sindé Chekete, the head of Benin's tourism authority, told the BBC that ""citizenship processing is not influenced by celebrity status"" and that Ciara ""followed the same standard procedure as any other applicant"".
Another criticism of the celebrity citizenship trend is that it will be superficial and fleeting - the stars will collect their certificates, publish a few social media posts, then go quiet.
It is not clear whether, in all cases, the celebrities are required to publicise or maintain lasting links to their second homes, but Chekete stressed that Beninois citizenship ""is not a transaction and it does not come with contractual obligations, whether promotional, financial, or otherwise"".
Six months after getting her citizenship, Ciara returned to Benin in January to play at the Vodun Days festival.
Meanwhile, Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have stressed that their connection with Guinea would be ""long-term and evolving"".
""We could absolutely see ourselves having a home here and spending meaningful time in Guinea,"" they told the BBC over email.
Yaw Nyame, one of the numerous Ghanaians who welcomed IShowSpeed's naturalisation, says he hopes the content creator uses his passport to set up a base in the country.
""Even if he's not going to come to Ghana all the time, at least him having his presence in Ghana or doing a project in Ghana,"" Nyame says.
The doctor says giving IShowSpeed, real name Darren Watkins Jr, a passport is a ""brilliant, strategic move"" as the creator currently has ""all eyes on him"". He has more than 50 million YouTube subscribers, with a recent 20-country tour of Africa contributing to the growth of his platform.
It will take time for Ghana, Gabon, Guinea and Benin to gauge whether their strategies have paid off - maybe one or two decades, Kpatindé says.
Earlier this week, Benin's government said it would open a government agency specifically dedicated to nationalising ""Afro-descendants"".
However, Ghana reached a roadblock in its plans to reconnect with the diaspora, announcing it was pausing its citizenship applications as it needed to make the system more accessible and user-friendly.
Regardless, Kpatindé believes that by welcoming home some of the diaspora's brightest stars, the African countries are on the right trajectory.
People on the continent have long hailed pan-Africanism, ""but now we need action,"" he says. ""We need concrete acts, not to just speak"".

South African farmers fear devastation as foot-and-mouth takes hold,2026-02-20T00:37:30.395Z,No Author Listed,"The peace of lush, rural landscape in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province disguises the anxiety that is stalking the land.
This is the epicentre of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak that has – in the past year – swept across eight of the country's nine provinces, devastating animal herds, with many cattle being killed to halt its spread.
Farmers are fearful that they could lose their livelihoods altogether as other countries take action and stop the import of South African animal products.
The highly contagious virus, passed through direct animal contact or in contaminated feed or water, causes painful blisters inside the mouth and under the hooves of animals such as goats, cows and sheep, and can lead to lameness and problems feeding. It lowers their yields and also sometimes kills young animals but is not harmful to humans.
The current situation in South Africa has now been declared a national disaster. Despite being a relatively small part of the economy, agriculture is a key employer in rural areas and in normal times provides vital foreign exchange through meat and livestock exports.
KwaZulu-Natal is the heartland of the country's dairy industry.
Farms, with their cows grazing on the grass, dot the green hills lining the Mooi River.
Here, biosecurity measures such as disinfection points at farm entrances designed to prevent the spread of the virus as well as roadblocks and restrictions on the movement of cattle, have not always worked.
The herd at the large commercial farm run by Carol Houston and her husband became infected last month.
""We received a call from our staff that 50 cows were showing signs of mastitis and were hobbling, struggling to walk. We did all we could to keep the disease out and spent roughly $380 (£280) per cow on treatment [including antibiotics],"" Houston tells the BBC.
""My milking herd's normal output dropped from 14,000 litres of milk per day to 9,000 within days of the outbreak because infected cows eat less and struggled to produce milk.""
Milk production stayed at that level for about two weeks until the infection was cleared from her herd of 2,200 cattle.
Now, as the cows line up to be milked, workers check each one for symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease.
With the afternoon sun beating down while the cows snort and moo, the workers inspect and clean the animals' teats, which are then attached to milking equipment. The machines gently suck out the milk and transfer it to large containers.
Houston, who has 35 years' farming experience, blames the government for failing to stop the spread of the virus – an opinion shared by many farmers, such as Peter Griffin, whose farm is in the same area.
""The problem is it's a catastrophe that could've been avoided,"" says the dejected dairy farmer who has been in the business for 44 years. ""We should never have got to this stage… the state has failed us.""
In South Africa, foot-and-mouth is classified as a ""controlled animal disease"", meaning that the government is responsible for taking the lead on measures to deal with it.
Agriculture Minister John Steenhuisen has faced a lot of criticism over the outbreak but last month he announced a long-term strategy to get rid of the disease within 10 years.
In the short-term this includes mass vaccination in the worst-affected areas before extending it to the majority of the national herd, estimated to number around 14 million animals.
But dairy farmer Houston is sceptical about how quickly this could happen.
""We were told we would have the vaccine in January, we haven't got the vaccine. We were told we would have the vaccine in February, we don't have vaccine. So the ball gets pushed out, pushed out, pushed out. It's very frustrating,"" she says.
Any delay could have big consequences for small-scale cattle farmers like Nompumelelo Ndlovu, who has about 20 animals and makes money from buying and selling them.
""My biggest fear is if the vaccine doesn't arrive on time, all my cattle will be at risk and that would be the end of my business,"" she says.
President Cyril Ramaphosa's designation of the outbreak as a national disaster allows the government to release extra funds and speed up the acquisition of vaccines from abroad.
Foot-and-mouth vaccines need to be imported as South Africa no longer has the capacity to produce them en masse. A lack of investment and a loss of technical expertise meant that the country's ability to make agricultural vaccines ended more than two decades ago, according to Steenhuisen's party, the Democratic Alliance.
The agriculture minister has announced the restart of domestic production, though it will take some time before enough is produced to vaccinate most of the country's entire herd as planned.
A million vaccines are due to arrive in South Africa from Argentina at the weekend, but they still have to be distributed and that is not enough to cover the whole country.
""We are hoping that government will get this right in vaccinating the entire herd with speed,"" says Ntuthuko Shezi, head of investment company Livestock Wealth.
""If we could get it right with Covid-19, we surely can with this outbreak.""

"Suspected carbon-monoxide leak kills at least 30 miners in Nigeria, witnesses say",2026-02-19T11:27:14.470Z," Mansur Abubakar
Abuja
","At least 33 miners have died in a suspected carbon-monoxide leak at a lead and zinc mine in central Nigeria's Plateau state, witnesses have told the BBC.
The tragedy is believed to have happened just before sunrise at a site outside the town of Wase run by the mining company Solid Unity Nigeria Ltd.
Toxic gas is believed to have built up underground in poorly ventilated tunnels, causing the workers to collapse just before the end of their night shift.
They were discovered by those reporting to work in the morning - more than 20 other miners were rescued and rushed to hospital for treatment.
Security personnel have sealed off the mine, which is about 200km (124 miles) south-east of the state capital of Jos, as investigations get under way to find out the cause of the leak.
State officials are yet to visit the area and response efforts have reportedly been slow because of security concerns - armed criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, have been active there in recent years.
The Nigerian government has suspended mining licences in the affected area and ordered an investigation, vowing to release further details in due course.
Safiyanu Haruna, one of the miners who found the bodies at the start of his shift, told the BBC that some of the miners who were underground survived and were taken to a hospital in Wase for treatment.
According to Haruna, the incident occurred at around 06:30 local time (05:30 GMT) killing 37 miners.
He said the miners had just finished performing their early morning Muslim prayers and had returned underground to finish their shift.
The Plateau state government has issued a statement saying that according to its preliminary investigation 33 miners were killed in a blast at the mine - but workers at the scene say this is not the case.
""It was carbon-monoxide gas that leaked and killed them,"" Haruna said.
""There was no rescue for them at the time because those who were coming for the morning shift had yet to arrive,"" he said.
""It is sad to lose 37 miners who were struggling to make ends meet. We're disturbed by the incident.""
The victims, believed to be men aged between 20 and 40, were buried shortly afterwards in accordance with local tradition, another local resident told the BBC.
The news has devastated the mainly Muslim community.
Mining disasters occur relatively frequently in Nigeria.
Less than two years ago, dozens of gold miners died after being trapped underground when a pit collapsed in neighbouring Niger state.
Officials believe that incident was caused by torrential rains which had softened the soil.
The tragedy is likely to renew concerns over safety standards in Nigeria's mining sector.

Turkey's president rejects Israel's recognition of Somaliland,2026-02-18T13:10:03.061Z," Michael Teferi
BBC Africa
","Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has rejected Israel's recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland as an independent nation.
During a visit to Ethiopia, Erdogan said it could prove dangerous for a volatile region.
In December, Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland, which declared independence from Somalia more than 30 years ago. The move upset Mogadishu, which still considers Somaliland as part of its territory.
Landlocked Ethiopia has yet to comment, but its plans two years ago to lease a piece of Somaliland's coastline to build a port angered Somalia at the time - and it was Erdogan who mediated an end to the dispute that had prompted fears of a wider conflict.
In reaction to Erdogan's comments, Somaliland's foreign ministry said that Turkey, which has in recent years become an important geopolitical player in the Horn of Africa, should refrain from inflaming regional tensions.
At a joint press conference in Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, Erdogan said: ""The Horn of Africa should not be the battlefield of foreign forces.
""We believe that countries of the region should address their problems by themselves.""
Meanwhile, Abiy urged Turkey to support Ethiopia's quest for sea access, arguing that it was unjust for the country to remain landlocked.
Eritrea officially seceded from Ethiopia in 1993, leaving the country without access to a 1,350km (840-mile) Red Sea coastline.
""It is not right for a country with a population of over 130 million to be denied sea access and remain a geographical prisoner for a long time due to the conspiracy of our enemies,"" Abiy said.
Since the Somaliland deal fell through in 2024, Abiy has been pushing for ownership of Eritrea's southern port of Assab - about 60km from its border - and hinted at the desire to take it by force.
Abiy said he had asked Turkey to exert diplomatic pressure and assist peacefully in securing access to the sea.
""We have had a strong discussion with President Erdogan to play his part in this regard. We thank him for this,"" the Ethiopian prime minister added.
This all comes against the backdrop of fears of a return to conflict in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, which borders Eritrea.
During the first Tigray war, which raged between 2020 and 2022, Eritrean forces fought alongside the Ethiopian army against local Tigrayan fighters.
But allegiances have changed - and any renewed conflict in Tigray is likely to inflame tensions between the neighbours who fought a devastating border war between 1998 and 2000 that claimed more than 100,000 lives.
Local media has been reporting about growing panic in cities in Tigray as alleged military build-ups continue near the region.
Banks in Tigray have run out of cash and civil servants did not receive their January salaries, further fuelling frustration.

Social media suspended in Gabon for 'spreading of false information',2026-02-18T11:05:05.298Z," Wycliffe MuiaandPaul Njie
BBC Africa
","Gabon's media regulator has announced the suspension of social media platforms ""until further notice"", saying online content has fuelled conflict and deepened divisions in the country.
In a televised statement on Tuesday evening, the High Authority for Communication (HAC) cited the ""spread of false information"", ""cyberbullying"" and the ""unauthorised disclosure of personal data"" as reasons for the decision.
Internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported that by Wednesday afternoon multiple online platforms had been restricted, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and WhatsApp.
Gabon is led by Gen Brice Oligui Nguema, who won presidential elections last year after leading a coup in 2023.
The 50-year-old president is facing growing social unrest, with teachers and civil servants staging strikes over pay and working conditions.
According to Netblocks, most internet providers had blocked access to the social media platforms, though its data showed that Gabon Telecom, the country's largest telecoms firm, was allowing very limited access.
The HAC's announcement has come as a shock to the central African nation of about 2.5 million people, where social media is particular popular with younger people who use it for business as well as pleasure.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a restaurant owner in the capital, Libreville, told the BBC the suspension would greatly affect his business, since he uses social media for promotion.
""Almost 40% of my customers decided to order or come to the restaurant after seeing our advertising on social media… I won't be able to catch new customers, because clients are attracted by what they are seeing, reviews from friends, pictures,"" he said.
""We are entering a phase where we don't even know if we are moving forward with global development or if we are sliding backward into total underdevelopment.""
However, a taxi driver seemed unbothered about the move, telling the BBC: ""There's no smoke without fire.
""For the authorities to take such a decision, something must have certainly prompted it.""
Nguema won last year's poll with more than 90% of the vote, two years after his coup ended more than five decades of rule by the Bongo family.
At the time he pledged to reform Gabon, a small, oil- and timber-rich country, where digital blackouts were used by the previous governments to control information.
For the first time, foreign and independent media were allowed to film the ballot count during the election.
The media regulator spokesman, Jean-Claude Mendome, said the suspension was prompted by the recurring dissemination on social networks and digital platforms of "" inappropriate, defamatory, hateful, and insulting content that undermines human dignity, social cohesion, the stability of the republic's institutions, and national security"".
Such actions, he said, were likely to ""generate social conflict"" and ""seriously jeopardise national unity, democratic progress, and achievements"".
But ""freedom of expression, including freedom of comment and criticism,"" remained ""a fundamental right enshrined in Gabon"", Mendome added.
School teachers in Gabon began striking in December over pay and working conditions, with protests over similar grievances spreading to other public sectors, including health and education.

Gold fever hits South Africa after lucky find in cattle pen,2026-02-18T00:28:35.275Z," Nomsa Maseko
Springs
Richard KagoeandNatasha Booty
","A gold rush has gripped an informal settlement east of the South African city of Johannesburg, after reports spread a few days ago about the discovery of some gold particles.
A resident in a poor neighbourhood of the former mining town of Springs claimed to have found several nuggets while digging at an outdoor enclosure used for cattle.
Dozens of people have now descended on the area and have been digging up the fenced area where the cows were once penned in, hoping to strike it rich.
Armed with pickaxes and shovels, they have been sifting through the soil in scenes reminiscent of the gold rush that helped build South Africa's financial capital more than a century ago.
Springs was once a booming gold town, but its mines were closed several years ago because the extreme depth of the shafts made operations uneconomical.
The town is now surrounded by informal settlements many of whose residents are migrants from neighbouring countries.
South Africa's Department of Mineral Resources has condemned this week's mining activity in Spring's informal settlement of Gugulethu, calling it illegal and warning that it is damaging the environment.
Some of those digging at the site have told the BBC that they have been able to find gold and have sold it on the black market.
Dangerous chemicals like mercury and sodium cyanide are used to separate the gold from the ore.
""We know this is illegal. We want the government to give us mining permits so we can work and pay tax,"" one man, who did not want to be named, told the BBC.
He explained that as a father of two children he needed to earn money to put them through school and put food on the table.
Another man told the BBC: ""This is the only hustle we know. It has saved many of us from being arrested for committing serious and violent crimes.""
A gram of gold is worth about $100 (£74).
By contrast, the monthly minimum wage in South Africa is $368 (£270).
Many of those busy digging during the BBC's visit said they originally hailed from the neighbouring Lesotho.
At around 14:00 local time after the end of the school day, children started arriving at the site.
They had gone home first to change out of their uniforms and then rushed to the cattle enclosure to help their parents dig for gold.
While visiting the site, the BBC found that some of the ground had become unstable.
""Unregulated excavation may result in ground instability, placing nearby communities and particularly children at significant risk of injury or loss of life,"" the mining ministry warned in its statement on Tuesday.
So-called illegal mining is common in South Africa, and numerous people have died over the years while working in unsafe conditions.
Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa said he would deploy the army to help the police fight criminal gangs and illegal mining in the country.
The authorities blame illegal miners, known as ""zama zamas"", typically armed, undocumented foreign nationals, for their involvement in organised crime syndicates.
There is no official indication that this is at play in Springs.

Family of Zambia's ex-President Lungu dismiss poisoning allegation - lawyers,2026-02-17T17:04:07.766Z," Khanyisile Ngcobo
Johannesburg
","The family of ex-Zambian President Edgar Lungu, who died in South Africa last June and is yet to be buried, have dismissed allegations he was poisoned.
South African police also want custody of his body as part of their investigations, according to the late politician's family.
In a letter to the police, seen by the BBC, their lawyers say the family are co-operating with ""criminal proceedings"", but maintain the allegations are ""unfounded and unsupported by credible evidence"".
It is the latest twist over the fate of Lungu's body, which remains in a morgue in South Africa and has been subject to an ongoing legal battle between his family and Zambia's government over where he should be buried.
South Africa's police service has refused to comment on the letter sent by the Johannesburg law firm Mashele Attorneys, which is representing the Lungu family.
Police spokesperson Brig Athlenda Mathe told the BBC: ""This is a very sensitive matter that cannot be discussed at this stage.""
Lungu died of an undisclosed illness aged 68 at a clinic in South Africa's capital, Pretoria. He had led Zambia from 2015 until 2021, when he lost elections by a huge margin to current President Hakainde Hichilema.
The Zambian government wants Lungu's remains to be repatriated and given a state funeral, with full state honours - and a South African court ruled in its favour in August.
But Lungu's family want a private burial in South Africa as they say the former president had not wanted Hichilema to attend his funeral. The relationship between the two politicians had long been fraught.
In the letter to the South African police, dated 11 February 2026, Mashele Attorneys confirmed that on behalf of the Lungu family it had ""complied with the five subpoenas issued"" in relation to a criminal probe looking into allegations that the former Zambian president was poisoned.
""For the avoidance of doubt, it is our clients' instruction that the allegations underlying the criminal case are denied,"" the letter said.
Neo Mashele, from Mashele Attorneys, told the BBC the investigation by police appeared to be based on a ""public utterance"" about a poisoning allegation made by one of Lungu's daughters that was ""absolutely not true"".
In its letter, Mashele Attorneys also raised concern over another subpoena it said had been issued by police to the funeral home looking after Lungu's body.
It said there were two High Court orders that directed that ""possession and custody of the body remain with Two Mountains Funeral Services pending the finalisation of the legal proceedings"".
""Those orders are binding and operative,"" the letter said.
An official from the morgue where the remains are being stored told the BBC that Lungu's body was ""under tight security [and] surveillance 24/7"".
Mrs Lungu has remained in South Africa since the death of her husband and is leading legal efforts to have him buried in South Africa.
Last week she filed a notice at the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein to overturn the earlier ruling that her husband's body be sent back home.

Strike deal reached after two days of chaos at Kenya's main airport,2026-02-17T12:50:33.656Z," Basillioh RukangaandWycliffe Muia
Nairobi
","Aviation workers in Kenya have agreed to resume work during the second day of their strike that has led to cancellations, delays and diversions which have particularly hit the main airport in the capital, Nairobi.
Operations are expected to slowly return to normal at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) - one of Africa's busiest transport hubs and where some passengers have spent more than 20 hours waiting for their flights.
The transport ministry oversaw urgent talks with unions and other groups.
""Aviation contributes immensely to the economy of the country and we are committed to ensure that the sector remains stable,"" said Transport Minister Davies Chirchir.
Passengers are still being advised to contact their airlines for the latest flight schedule before heading to airports.
The news will be a relief to the hundred of passengers who have been stranded at JKIA.
Earlier Jack Okoth, a Kenyan student who was travelling to the UK, told the BBC he had been at the airport for more than 20 hours and was not able to go home and wait there as that was far away in the west of the country.
The strike affected all flights and some companies, like Premier Airlines, which operates direct flights to South Sudan's capital, Juba, took the decision early on Tuesday to cancel all their operations for the day.
As the second day of the strike began, the Kenya Airline Pilots Association said it was concerned that the ongoing disruption might ""affect crew scheduling and rest, increasing fatigue"".
Last week, the Kenya Aviation Workers Union (KAWU) warned it would strike over pay and poor working conditions.
KAWU Secretary General Moss Ndiema told the BBC's Newsday programme before a deal to return to work was agreed that one of the main reasons for the strike was ""the failure by the Kenyan aviation authority to conclude a collective bargaining agreement on salary concerns and issues related to working conditions"".
Aviation sector workers blamed the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) for stalling salary negotiations, delaying union remittances and discrimination.
They also accused the authority's management of showing an unwillingness to resolve labour disputes that had persisted for more than a decade.
Last week, KCAA went to court seeking orders to halt the strike. A labour court judge suspended the action pending further directions due next week.
Following its intervention, the transport ministry said on Tuesday that all parties had formally agreed to an immediate return to work - with a promise of further round-table talks to address workers' concerns.
On Monday, a Kenyan senator who was travelling from the western city of Kisumu said that he had to travel by road following the strike.
""Passengers at JKIA are currently experiencing the true meaning of patience and character development,"" another Kenyan said on Monday, adding: ""If you have a flight today just carry a mattress because you might be living at the airport.""
The main airport in Nairobi is one of the busiest hubs in the region and serves as a key gateway between the continent and the rest of the world. Last year, it handled about nine million passengers, according to Kenyan authorities.

Fake funeral suspects allegedly used hearse to smuggle charcoal in Malawi,2026-02-17T08:52:48.087Z," Peter Jegwa
Lilongwe
Richard KagoeandWycliffe Muia
","Police in Malawi are searching for nine suspects who escaped from custody after being caught allegedly smuggling charcoal in a hearse disguised as part of a funeral procession.
Acting on a tip-off, forestry officials intercepted the vehicle at a roadblock near the main city of Blantyre. Inside, they found an empty coffin placed over several bags of charcoal, with an estimated value of $1,700 (£1,200), the Reuters news agency reported.
But a manager from the funeral service told the BBC that the hearse driver was returning from seeing a bereaved family when he bought the bags of fuel that were later confiscated.
The smuggling of charcoal, in high demand for cooking, is widespread in Malawi.
William Mitembe, a forestry official, told local media that the weekend's operation was the ""most complex illegal charcoal trafficking case in the country's history"".
About 30 bags of charcoal concealed underneath an empty coffin were seized during a routine roadblock in Chikwawa district, about 40 km (25 miles) south of Blantyre, another forestry official, Hector Nkawihe, told Reuters.
But in an interview with the BBC, the company manager of the affected funeral service had a different version of events.
Patrick Dimba said that a hearse driver had been sent to a family with two coffins in order for them to select one.
It was on his way back with the remaining empty coffin that the driver bought 11 bags of charcoal.
According to Dimba, there were no other passengers in the hearse when it was stopped at the checkpoint.
However, a police spokesman told Reuters that nine suspects remain at large and have not yet been charged.
Nkawihe said the suspects were briefly detained, but later escaped custody leaving behind the impounded hearse.
""They face two charges of illegal possession of forestry products and transportation of the same,"" he added.
If guilty, the suspects could face up to five years in prison or a fine.
The illegal charcoal trade is rampant in Malawi and a major driver of deforestation. Most Malawians rely on it for cooking due to frequent electricity blackouts.
Last month, Malawi's energy regulator hiked petrol and diesel prices by more than 40%, marking the second time fuel costs gone up in four months.
President Peter Mutharika, who returned to power last year, has been trying to revive Malawi's ailing economy.

South African trio charged with Bolt driver's murder filmed on dashcam,2026-02-16T15:03:02.835Z," Khanyisile Ngcobo
Johannesburg
","Three South Africans have been charged with murder following the killing of an e-hailing taxi driver, the manner of whose death, captured on dashcam footage, has shocked many people.
A video shared widely on social media shows a man and a woman tussling with the driver, Isaac Satlat, who they appeared to be robbing. Satlat tries to fight back before one of the passengers appears to strangle him until he goes limp.
The trio, who were arrested over the weekend, were in court in Pretoria on Monday and have since abandoned their bail applications. They were not asked to comment on the charges.
A fourth suspect later handed himself over to police on Monday.
He will appear in court on Tuesday, police said in a brief update after Dikeledi Mphela, 24, Goitsione Machidi, 25 and McClaren Mushwana, 30 made a brief appearance. All four also face robbery charges.
Satlat, 22, was a Nigerian national but, in a country that has often been blighted by xenophobic violence, his family said the attack was not linked to his nationality.
According to prosecutors, the accused ordered a ride on e-hailing platform Bolt last Wednesday using a number not registered in any of their names.
When the car arrived, Mphela and the fourth suspect allegedly got into the car while Machidi and Mushwana followed them in a separate car, authorities added.
They then ""forced the deceased to stop the vehicle, strangled him to death and robbed him of his cell phone and vehicle which was later recovered"", the prosecuting authority's spokesperson Lumka Mahanjana said.
There has been a growing number of reports of e-hailing drivers coming under attack in South Africa, with many drivers calling for greater protection, as the country grapples with high crime levels and one of the highest murder rates in the world.
The e-hailing partners' council condemned Satlat's killing, adding that it was not an ""isolated incident"".
The organisation praised the role that the dashcam footage and social media played in capturing his murder but reiterated calls for ""preventative security measures"" to better protect drivers.
It also called on e-hailing companies to ""vet and verify passengers to prevent criminals masquerading as customers"".
Numerous political parties and e-hailing drivers gathered outside the court house on Monday to protest against Satlat's murder.
One driver called for the government to set up a task team to deal with the attacks on them, according to local broadcaster Newzroom Afrika.
He also called for the establishment of a system to compensate the families of drivers killed on the job. Spokesperson for the Satlat family Solomon Izang Ashoms said his relatives were left with unanswered questions.
""His dad is struggling, we're very afraid for [him] because his blood pressure's been shooting up [since the death],"" Ashoms said.
The case against the three was postponed to next Monday.

Ghana tomato traders among dead in Burkina Faso attack,2026-02-16T14:56:55.819Z," BBC MonitoringandKomla Adom
Accra
","Reports say at least 20 people were killed on Saturday in the northern town of Titao, Burkina Faso, in attacks claimed by JNIM - an Islamist militant group linked to al-Qaeda.
Among the dead were seven Ghanaians ""burnt beyond recognition"" who have yet to be identified, said Ghana's Interior Minister Mohammed Muntaka Mubarak.
They were part of a team of tomato traders on a supply lorry targeted by the jihadists. Road access to the area remains blocked, according to Ghanaian officials trying to evacuate other citizens who survived, making it impossible for embassy staff to visit the area.
A spate of Islamist attacks have taken place in northern and eastern Burkina Faso in the past four days.
Burkina Faso's military rulers - who came to power promising an end to the jihadist violence - have not confirmed an official death toll for this latest spate of killings.
But on Sunday, an army spokesman insisted the situation was under control.
""Multiple attacks took place on Saturday in the north of the country. Our forces demonstrated valour and professionalism, inflicting a heavy defeat on the terrorists and neutralising several dozen of them,"" Lt Col Abdoul Aziz Ouedraogo said on state-run RTB the following day.
Ouedraogo said the attack followed recent military operations in the north and Sahel regions, which had forced militants to regroup westwards.
Describing the attack on Titao, witnesses said the attackers divided into three groups: one group targeted a military camp, another destroyed telephone facilities and a third looted and burnt shops and supply trucks.
According to unnamed security sources quoted by the AFP news agency, ""hundreds"" of armed jihadists overran the Titao camp leaving it partially destroyed. They are also quoted as saying militants carried out a major attack on a military detachment in the northern town of Nare. Neither of these reports has been confirmed by the government.
Titao's military base is of particular concern because it is said to be one of the best-equipped within the Burkinabè army. Just two days earlier, French broadcaster RFI reports, suspected JNIM militants had seized control of Bilanga town in the east, killing 18 soldiers.
As of Monday, Ghana's interior minister said he was engaged with Burkinabè authorities who planned on burying the dead, in the absence of embassy officials.
Some of the Ghanaian survivors would be asked to help, he added: ""The women who sustained minor to no injuries have been asked to witness the burial of the dead to capture and document the process.""
He said the victims' bodies had already begun to decompose.
According to the minister, Burkinabè authorities have offered military assistance to ""create a safe passage to move the unharmed women and the injured to our mission in Ouagadougou after the burial"".
The tomato and onion truck drivers' association says the attackers set the vehicle on fire after the driver allegedly tried to take cover.
The association has long called for enhanced safety for traders who embark on cross-border travels to countries like Burkina Faso to purchase tomatoes and onions.
Eric Tuffour said the latest incident highlights the enormous risks these traders endure in their quest to transport vegetables for sale in the country.

Nigeria warns against enlisting abroad after reports of deaths in Ukraine,2026-02-16T10:06:12.290Z," Makuochi Okafor
BBC Africa

Abuja
","Nigeria's foreign ministry has issued an urgent warning over what it describes as the increasing illegal recruitment of its citizens to fight in foreign conflicts.
It comes after Ukrainian officials said they found the bodies of two Nigerians who they said were killed in combat last year.
Nigeria has not confirmed those deaths but in a statement on Sunday, foreign ministry spokesperson Kimiebi Imomotimi Ebienfa revealed that ""several Nigerians who have fallen victim to such unfortunate situations were deployed to combat zones after being misled and coerced into signing military service contracts"".
Kenya has issued a similar warning to its citizens.
According to Nigerian officials, investigations and security reports indicate that some nationals were enticed with promises of well-paid employment, security work, educational opportunities or migration incentives, only to find themselves thrust into active war zones.
In some cases, victims were allegedly forced to sign contracts written in foreign languages without proper legal advice, and their travel documents were confiscated upon arrival.
Intermediaries are also said to arrange travel using tourist or other non-military visas.
Ebienfa cautioned Nigerians against accepting such offers, emphasising that they not only endanger lives but may also violate Nigerian and international laws concerning mercenary activities and foreign enlistment.
The Nigerian government stated it was working with local and international partners to investigate these cases and enhance public awareness.
Its diplomatic missions abroad have been directed to strengthen consular support and issue advisories to citizens.
Ukrainian intelligence estimates that more than 1,400 individuals from 36 African countries have been recruited to fight for Russia. Ukraine itself has previously faced criticism for attempting to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.
African governments have increasingly been warning their citizens and working to repatriate those who were deceived into joining the conflict.
Last week, South Africa announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin had pledged assistance in returning South African nationals who had travelled to Ukraine to join Russian forces.
Retired Nigerian military expert Maj Bashir Galma told the BBC that the recruitment of Nigerians and other Africans into foreign conflicts was not unprecedented.
""Even during the Yugoslavia issues many years ago, we had that problem and it is sad that our youth are falling into these traps and losing their lives to a war that means nothing to them,"" he said.

Motorbike raids on villages kill dozens in Nigeria,2026-02-15T15:29:26.146Z," Makuochi Okafor
West Africa reporterandHarry Sekulich
","Gunmen on motorcycles have killed dozens of people in dawn raids across three villages in north-western Nigeria.
Armed men shot locals dead, set homes alight and abducted an unknown number of people in Niger State, Musa Saidu, head of the State Emergency Management Agency (Sema), told the BBC.
The attacks on Saturday morning occurred near the site of a suspected jihadist massacre earlier this month, in which more than 100 people were killed in a similar ambush.
Armed criminal gangs, known as bandits, have carried out attacks and kidnappings in Nigeria for years, mainly targeting those in the north-west - but reports of attacks in other parts of the country have risen sharply more recently.
Bandits swooped on the village of Tunga-Makeri early in the morning, before striking the nearby villages of Konkoso and Pissa, local officials said.
Police said six people were killed in one incident, and 20 more in the attacks on Konkoso and Pisa.
Officials confirmed at least 29 people had been killed as of Saturday, but Saidu said that death toll could rise.
The number of people abducted is also unknown because many residents fled their homes and ran into the nearby bush or neighbouring communities, he said.
""People are afraid because you can't tell which community is going to be next,"" he added.
A security report cited by AFP news agency said bandits came on 41 motorcycles, each carrying two or three men.
Abdullahi Rofia, a resident of neighbouring Agwara, told the BBC that many displaced people have taken shelter in his community, which was itself attacked two weeks ago.
""People are so traumatised, they no longer go to farm nor do they go to market,"" he said.
""The bandits are not interesting in stealing or looting - they are more interested in killing and terrorising locals.""
Authorities have introduced emergency measures, including a restriction on late-night gatherings and a ""partial curfew"" that bans motorcycle taxis from operating after 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT).
Police confirmed that security teams have been deployed and rescue efforts are ongoing.
Nigeria's leaders are under pressure to curb violence, with jihadist groups active in the north-west and separatist insurgents based in the country's south-east.
The US launched Christmas Day strikes targeting Islamist militants in Nigeria's northern Sokoto state and President Donald Trump warned of further attacks ""if they continue to kill Christians"".
Many of the victims of jihadist violence are Muslim, according to organisations monitoring political violence in Nigeria.
A Nigerian official told the BBC last month that 200 suspected bandits had been killed in an operation in the central Kogi state.
It came after more than 250 children and staff were abducted from a Catholic school in Papiri, in one of the largest recent mass-kidnappings. Their release was later secured.

Planned US-funded baby vaccine trial in Guinea-Bissau blasted by WHO,2026-02-14T16:20:33.622Z,No Author Listed,"A now-halted plan to run a hepatitis B vaccine trial involving thousands of newborns in Guinea-Bissau has been criticised by the World Health Organization as ""unethical"".
The US-funded study had sought to give one set of babies the vaccine at birth, while another would have had the shot delayed until six weeks of age.
The WHO said it had ""significant concerns"" about the plan, and described the birth-dose vaccine as ""an effective and essential public health intervention, with a proven record"".
The US health department, headed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has questioned the effects of vaccines, had sought to use the trial to answer questions about the jab's broader health effects.
The WHO said on Friday that its concerns regarded the study's scientific justification, ethical safeguards and consistency with established standards for research involving humans.
It stressed that the jab had been used for more than three decades in more than 115 countries.
The WHO said giving a proven life-saving intervention to some newborns but not others exposed them to ""potentially irreversible harm"".
A sizeable portion of Guinea-Bissau's population is estimated to have hepatitis B, and the WHO says vaccination at birth prevents the virus being transmitted from mother to baby in 70-95% of cases.
It argued that trials giving one group a placebo or not treating them were only acceptable when no proven treatment existed, something that was not the case with the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine.
The WHO recommends that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. It says infection at birth is the most common way of having a lifelong infection, with 90% of infected newborns becoming chronic carriers.
In Guinea-Bissau, the dose is currently given at six weeks, though authorities plan to introduce the birth dose nationwide by 2028 to align with global standards, something the WHO said it would help accelerate.
A total of 14,000 babies in the West African country were due to be involved in the study funded by the US and led by Danish researchers.
But public outrage at the project prompted the Guinea-Bissau government to suspend it last month.
Critics have questioned why babies in the African country were being proposed for the trial.
Two months ago, a panel of top advisers voted to stop recommending that all newborns in the US receive a hepatitis B vaccine.
The panel was appointed by the US Health Secretary Kennedy, who had fired all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip) months earlier and replaced them with others critical of vaccines.
Kennedy has on several occasions denied being against vaccinations and has said he and his children had been vaccinated, but has also repeatedly stated widely debunked claims about vaccine harms.
Vocal opponents of the project in Guinea-Bissau include the country's former health minister, Magda Robalo.
""It's not acceptable and it should not go on,"" she told the science journal Nature last month. ""Guinea-Bissauans are not guinea pigs.""
More than 12% of the country's adult population has chronic Hepatitis B, according to the WHO. Smaller studies by other researchers have estimated the proportion could be as high as one in five.
Most people with the virus do not have any symptoms, or have very mild symptoms.
But some people can experience jaundice, dark urine, feeling very tired, nausea, vomiting and pain in the abdomen.
The WHO says chronic patients have a high risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

"Sudanese city had 6,000 killed in three days, UN says",2026-02-13T18:01:05.890Z," Natasha BootyandRichard Kagoe
","More than 6,000 people were killed in just three days when Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the city of el-Fasher last year, according to victims and witnesses cited in a UN report.
""It was like a scene out of a horror movie,"" recalled one person, who saw bodies thrown into the air as RSF fighters opened fire on 1,000 people sheltering in a university building last October.
The report cites evidence of mass killings, summary executions, torture, abductions and sexual violence against civilians. These amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, it says.
The RSF has not commented on the report but has denied previous such accusations.
Sudan remains locked in an almost three‑year power struggle between the regular army and the RSF paramilitaries. The ongoing civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, and forced more than 13 million people from their homes. Widespread sexual violence against men, women and children is being used as a weapon of war.
Both the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces have been accused of atrocities.
The US and Human Rights Watch believe the RSF and its allies have waged a genocide in the western Darfur region against the Massalit people and other non-Arab communities, but recent UN reports have stopped short of calling it this.
El-Fasher, a key city located in Darfur, came under 18 months of sustained siege. It is where some of the most harrowing stories have emerged in this conflict.
More than 140 victims and witnesses gave testimony in Sudan's Northern state and in eastern Chad in late 2025, according to the UN Human Rights Office.
In those first few days of the assault on el-Fasher, the UN says ""at least 4,400 people were killed"" within the city, and ""over 1,600 others along exit routes as they fled"".
""The actual scale of the death toll during the week-long offensive is undoubtedly significantly higher,"" the report adds.
The UN Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, has renewed calls on all sides in Sudan to end what he described as grave violations by forces under their command.
International pressure has been increasing on the backers of this conflict to disengage.
The UAE has denied widespread claims that it is the main supplier of arms to RSF fighters.
Last week, the UK imposed sanctions on six key figures it said were fuelling Sudan's war - including senior commanders in the army and the RSF, as well as three foreign nationals allegedly responsible for recruiting Colombian mercenaries to fight for the RSF.
British lawmakers had also recently spoken out in parliament following UN claims that weapons sold lawfully by the UK to the UAE were then re-sold by the UAE to the RSF.
""The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously,"" Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said in response.
Plans to set up a rival Sudanese government baaed in the west of the country have been announced by a coalition linked to the RSF, called the Sudan Founding Alliance.
The African Union has rejected those plans, warning that such a move would threaten any prospect of unity.

To support children in Sudan and other Arabic-speaking countries who are denied or restricted from accessing education, the BBC World Service is launching a new season of the Arabic edition of its award-winning educational programme Dars - or Lesson.
The first episode aired on Saturday 24 January, on BBC News Arabic TV. New episodes are broadcast weekly on Saturdays at 09:30 GMT (11:30 EET), with repeats on Sundays at 05:30 GMT (07:30 EET) and throughout the week.

Kenya's border with Somalia set to re-open after almost 15 years,2026-02-13T11:56:08.363Z," Richard Kagoe
Nairobi
","Kenya's border with Somalia will re-open in April almost 15 years after it shut because of attacks by Islamist militant group al-Shabab, President William Ruto has announced.
Based in Somalia, the group has masterminded a series of deadly assaults in Kenya including one on a shopping centre in the capital, Nairobi, killing 67 people in 2013 and one at a university in Garissa two years later killing 148.
The plan has been announced before, in 2023, but further attacks postponed the arrangements.
Ruto said the intention to re-open two crossings follows years of security assessments, adding that there will be a heavy deployment of security forces to ensure the move does not compromise safety.
Kenya has also been concerned about illicit weapons and other contraband goods being smuggled across the border.
The border was closed in October 2011, when the East African nation launched a major military incursion into Somalia to push back al-Shabab - an al-Qaeda affiliate - from its border.
These soldiers were later absorbed into the African Union force, a version of which is still in Somalia and still has a Kenyan contingent.
Ruto's announcement came days after the Mogadishu-based Hiraal Institute think-tank issued a wide-ranging report about the security situation in Somalia, saying that al-Shabab was growing in strength and had regained most of the territory in central areas it lost in a big government offensive in 2022.
""The pattern of al-Shabab's territorial recovery reveals both the group's strategic acumen and the government's structural weaknesses,"" the report said.
The government's offensive had been hasty - taking advantage of an uprising over taxes imposed by the militants - but it did not have a strategy to reclaim its sovereignty fully, according to Hiraal's Mohamed Mubarak.
""The nature of the operation caused a huge desertion of forces,"" he told the BBC's Newsday programme.
""With the government's mandate ending in less than three months… I don't think there's going to be any more operations against al-Shabab in the foreseeable future.""
President Ruto announced the plan to reopen the frontier on a visit to the border town of Mandera, in Kenya's far north-east, which has a large population of ethnic Somalis.
""It is unacceptable that fellow Kenyans in Mandera remain cut off from their kin and neighbours in Somalia due to the prolonged closure of the Mandera Border Post,"" Ruto posted on X.
He hoped that the re-opening would boost ""cross-border trade for the mutual prosperity of our people"".
In a speech, he asked all residents of Mandera, which has been targeted several times, to ""join in the battle against al-Shabab. These al-Shabab are useless, I want to assure that Kenya will work together with you, just help us combat these criminals and terrorists.""
In addition to the attack on the Westgate mall and Garissa University, other major al-Shabab attacks in Kenya include the killing of 28 bus passengers in Mandera county in 2014 and an assault on a hotel in Nairobi five years later which left at least 21 people dead.
In 2015, Kenya had embarked on building a perimeter barrier along the countries' 680km (423-mile) common border because of the militant threat but the project was suspended after nearly three years when only 10km (six miles) of a wire fence had been built at a cost of $35m (£26m).

South Africa to deploy troops to tackle crime gangs,2026-02-13T10:20:34.790Z," Wycliffe Muia
","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he will deploy the army to help the police fight criminal gangs and illegal mining in the country.
Gang violence is a major problem in South Africa, which has one of the world's highest murder rates.
""Organised crime is now the most immediate threat to our democracy, our society and our economic development,"" Ramaphosa said in his annual State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday.
""I will be deploying the South African National Defence Force to support the police,"" he added.
Last month, Police Minister Firoz Cachalia said the country's police were not yet able to defeat the deadly criminal gangs, in a stark admission that underscored the scale of the country's crime crisis.
In his address to parliament, Ramaphosa said he had directed the chiefs of the police and army to draw up a plan on where ""our security forces should be deployed within the next few days"".
He said the military deployment would start in the provinces of Western Cape and Gauteng, home to the cities of Cape Town and Johannesburg, because of rising gang violence and illegal mining respectively.
""Children here in the Western Cape are caught in the crossfire of gang wars. People are chased out of their homes by illegal miners in Gauteng,"" said Ramaphosa.
Authorities blame illegal miners, known as ""zama zamas"", typically armed, undocumented foreign nationals, for their involvement in organised crime syndicates.
Ramaphosa ruled out deploying troops to Cape Town just two weeks ago, saying soldiers were trained for combat and not community policing. He did not explain why he changed his mind but there have been increasing calls for him to take action to tackle gang violence.
Beyond the military deployment, Ramaphosa announced additional measures to combat crime, including recruiting 5,500 police officers, strengthening intelligence, and targeting crime syndicates.
South Africa, the continent's most industrialised nation, has long struggled with entrenched organised crime.
Police data shows that an average of 63 people were killed each day between April and September last year.

Port city in ruins as storm rips through Madagascar and on towards Mozambique,2026-02-12T14:01:04.460Z," Jean OtalorandNatasha Booty
","At least 35 people have died after a powerful cyclone struck Madagascar, says the disaster authority in the Indian Ocean island.
Cyclone Gezani made landfall on Tuesday, hitting the island's main port, Toamasina. Madagascar's disaster management office said there was ""total chaos"" - reporting that houses collapsed in the impact zone, where the bodies were found.
Neighbourhoods were plunged into darkness as power lines snapped, while trees were uprooted and roofs ripped off.
As many as 250,000 people are ""affected or displaced"", Environment Minister Max Fontaine Andonirina told BBC Newsday on Thursday.
Huge challenges include ""disruptions to food-supply chains, to the fuel transport, to the medical access, because most of the major roads are cut"", he added.
One resident described to the BBC how she and her family cowered inside as wind and rain lashed their home for six hours straight, before the windows smashed and water poured in.
""We are trying to do our best... It's dangerous and I don't know if there will be enough people to help us, even though the authorities are trying,"" the woman, who gave her name as Denise, told BBC Newsday.
""It's real and its worse"" than it looks in videos being shared online, she added.
Gezani is the second cyclone to hit Madagascar this year. It comes 10 days after tropical cyclone Fytia killed 14 and displaced over 31,000 people, according to the UN's humanitarian office.
The island's rulers are now pleading for international help.
""What happened is a disaster, nearly 75% of the city of Toamasina was destroyed,"" the country's military leader Colonel Michael Randrianirina, who seized power in October, told the AFP news agency.
""The current situation exceeds Madagascar's capabilities alone,"" he added.
The cyclone's landfall is likely to have been one of the most intense recorded around the city in the satellite era, according to the CMRS cyclone forecaster on France's Reunion island, AFP reports.
The National Office for Risk and Disaster Management said many were killed when houses collapsed. Cyclone Gezani hit Toamasina - the country's second-largest city - with winds reaching 250 km/hour (155 mph).
""It's total chaos, 90% of house roofs have been blown off, entirely or in part,"" the head of disaster management at the Action Against Hunger aid agency, Rija Randrianarisoa, told AFP.
All acknowledge that a huge amount of work needs to be done.
""It takes many, many years"" to restore infrastructure and recover, Environment Minister Andonirina told the BBC, adding that parts of Madagascar ravaged by cyclones in the past three years still ""have not been rebuilt as it was before"".
Cyclone season in the Indian Ocean around Madagascar normally lasts from November to April and sees around a dozen storms each year, AFP reports.
Madagascar's disaster management office has evacuated dozens of injured people and hundreds of residents from a district around Toamasina, home to 400,000 people.
Residents in and around Toamasina described scenes of chaos as the cyclone made landfall. ""I have never experienced winds this violent... The doors and windows are made of metal, but they are being violently shaken,"" Harimanga Ranaivo told the Reuters news agency.
Ahead of the cyclone's arrival, officials shuttered schools and rushed to prepare emergency shelters.
Later on Wednesday, its status was downgraded from cyclone to tropical storm.
As Gezani moves away from Madagascar and up through the Mozambican Channel, Mozambique's National Meteorological Institute (INAM) say it does not expect it to make landfall, but that some inland areas may suffer heavy rain and wind.
Mozambique is still reeling from months of severe weather that has forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. Aid agencies fear an already desperate situation will become worse, with Oxfam warning that Gezani risks heaping ""disaster upon disaster"".

At least 21 dead after boat sinks on Sudan's River Nile,2026-02-12T11:51:41.555Z," Alfred Lasteck
","At least 21 people have died after a passenger boat sank in River Nile state in northern Sudan, a medical group has told the BBC.
The boat was travelling between the villages of Tayba al-Khawad and Deim al-Qarai, carrying nearly 30 passengers, including women, elderly people and children, the Sudan Doctors Network said.
""Rescue teams are continuing with their work since there could be more bodies,"" said Dr Mohamed Faisal Hassan, the network's spokesperson.
Authorities in River Nile state said on Thursday that 21 bodies had been recovered, AFP news agency reported.
Eyewitnesses said the boat capsized due to high waves on Wednesday evening in the Shendi area.
In an earlier statement, the medical group said six people had survived.
The group urged authorities to deploy specialised rescue teams and equipment to accelerate search efforts.
It urged authorities to ""take immediate measures to ensure river transport safety and prevent the recurrence of such disasters that claim innocent lives"".
""This painful humanitarian tragedy once again reveals the fragility of river transport and the absence of basic safety requirements,"" it added.
Dr Hassan told the BBC that weak regulation of river transport may have contributed to the tragedy.
He said many of the boats operating on the Nile were privately owned and that authorities lacked proper regulatory systems and safety measures.
Authorities did not immediately respond.
Sudan often sees accidents involving traditional boats, which are commonly used to cross the Nile because bridges are scarce, particularly in rural areas.
The country has been engulfed in a brutal conflict since April 2023, when fighting erupted between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
The war has devastated large parts of the country, particularly the capital Khartoum and regions such as Darfur, displacing millions and crippling basic services.
River Nile State, where the boat accident occurred, has been largely spared from frontline fighting, though the broader instability has strained resources and infrastructure nationwide.

Epstein survivor calls on Palace to search Andrew's files,2026-02-11T20:03:52.189Z," Mayeni Jones
Cape TownandAmy Walker
","A survivor of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse has called on Buckingham Palace to proactively search files and emails relating to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's relationship with the paedophile financier.
Juliette Bryant told the BBC she welcomed a statement this week in which the King said he was ""ready to support"" the police as they consider allegations against his brother.
But Bryant, who said she was abused by Epstein in the early 2000s, called on the Royal Family to do more to help uncover the truth.
Bryant never met Andrew and has made no allegations against him. A Palace spokesperson previously said the King had ""made clear...his profound concern"" at allegations about Andrew.
Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Epstein.
Bryant, 43, spoke to the BBC at her home in Cape Town, South Africa.
In reference to the Palace, she said: ""It's great that they've made a statement, finally. But the thing is, are they going to actually act on it?""
The former aspiring model said both she and other victims were willing to be contacted by the Palace, adding ""I just hope they're not just saying this. I would like to see them actually taking action"".
Referring to the Palace, as well as the police and other authorities, she added: ""They need to go through all Prince Andrew's files and emails.""
Bryant said the authorities had previously gone through ""all my information"" in relation to her contact with Epstein.
""I think it's about time they went through his information, since he was actually Epstein's friend,"" she said.
""I think that they should be releasing information if they have nothing to hide.""
A Palace spokesperson said: ""The King has made clear, in words and through unprecedented actions, his profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's conduct.""
""While the specific claims in question are for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police we stand ready to support them as you would expect,"" they added.
""As was previously stated, Their Majesties' thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse.""
The co-author of a recent memoir by Virginia Giuffre, Amy Wallace, also welcomed what she described as a seemingly strengthened response from the Palace.
Speaking to BBC Woman's Hour on Wednesday, Wallace said ""they're calling him out specifically, as opposed to a general expression of concern for the survivors, which they had already done"".
But she added that she remained doubtful that Andrew would heed growing calls to testify in the US about his links to Epstein.
""The one thing that'll make him do it is if King Charles tells him he has to,"" said Wallace.
More than three million files relating to Epstein were released by the US department of Justice (DOJ) last month.
The latest tranche of documents included photos of Andrew, fully clothed, kneeling on all fours over a woman lying on the ground.
Material in the files also suggests he knowingly shared confidential information with Epstein from his official work as trade envoy in 2010 and 2011.
Bryant said she was 20 when she met Epstein - who was 49 at the time - at a restaurant in Cape Town in 2002.
She said he abused her multiple times on his island as well as his ranch in New Mexico between 2002 and 2004 and described feeling like a ""scared mouse around a snake"".
""He was a mastermind criminal and highly manipulative,"" she said. ""I wasn't able to deal with the situation as many of the other young girls weren't.""
Bryant also said Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell was central to her abuse and should never be released from prison.
Maxwell - who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking - this week declined to answer questions at a US congressional hearing, with her lawyer saying she would only speak if offered clemency.
""She was often there [on the island] but I was very scared of her,"" said Bryant. ""It was almost like she sort of was running the place, she was very well educated and very sure of herself. I was just petrified of her.""

Ghanaians embrace 'Fugu Day' after online mockery of traditional outfits,2026-02-11T17:15:17.651Z," Thomas Naadi
BBC Africa
AccraandWycliffe Muia
","Ghanaians across the country have turned out en masse to wear the country's colourful traditional outfit, the fugu, after the government designated Wednesdays ""Fugu Day"".
The move comes after President John Dramani Mahama's state visit to Zambia last week when he wore the garment. Some mockingly called it a ""blouse"", prompting a fierce response from Ghanaians online.
Ghana's Tourism Minister Abla Dzifa Gomashie said on Tuesday that wearing the outfit every week would help project the country's identity ""with pride on the global stage"".
She encouraged wearing the outfit ""in all its diverse forms, designs, and expressions, complemented by its distinctive and beautiful accessories"".
The fugu, also known as batakari, is a traditional northern Ghanaian top made from hand‑woven, narrow strips of thick cotton fabric stitched together to form a structured, poncho‑style garment.
It is worn by traditional leaders in northern Ghana, as well as ordinary citizens, and is a symbol of royalty and authority.
The traditional fugu top is more often associated with men, who sometimes wear trousers and a hat in matching material, but women also wear a version of it, which can be styled longer or as a dress.
When Ghana became the first sub-Saharan nation to break free from colonial rule in 1957, its founding father - the pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah - and five others wore fugus at the celebrations that marked the country's independence from the UK.
Beyond its cultural importance, Gomashie said the outfit's weekly display would ""generate far-reaching social and economic benefits"" especially for local weavers, designers, artisans and traders.
""The government hopes that this collective embrace of fugu will strengthen national unity, stimulate the creative economy, and serve as a powerful symbol of Ghana's cultural confidence and self-expression,"" the minister added.
Following the announcement, many Ghanaians on Wednesday heeded the minister's call, wearing the outfit in a variety of colours across the country.
Bismark Owusu Sarpong told the BBC in the capital, Accra, that he was proud to wear his blue, white and black striped fugu, which he had received as a gift, to put ""Ghana on the map"" - plus he said the outfit came with the added bonus of being comfortable.
Raymond Avenor, also in Accra, agreed wholeheartedly with this: ''Fugu is an easy wear.
""You pick it and off you go. You don't have to iron it, we don't wash it often as it should be,"" the civil servant told the BBC, sporting a blue fugu with white stitching.
""Significantly it's the northern people of Ghana that use this and it depicts, according to my understanding, royalty. I feel good when I wear it.""
For Andrews Tetteh Zutah, who owns more than seven of the tops, ""Fugu Day"" should not only be restricted to Wednesdays.
""I wish to have more,"" said the Accra office worker in his stripped red, khaki and black fugu.
""I wish I will be allowed to wear it anytime to the office but because of office constraints I'm unable to wear it every day. Personally, it's one of the outfits I love most.""
The attention has been great for fugu makers and sellers too.
Elijah Sulemana Musah, owner of a fugu factory, says business is booming - adding that he has received lots of orders from Ghanaian celebrities such as popular musicians Okyeame Kwame and Kwabena Kwabena.
''I've had calls coming in from several places both within and outside Ghana. I just met someone who said Zambians have called her and they are interested in the fugu and so she would wants me to supply to her,"" he told the BBC.
The iconic outfit has been trending on social media for days following the banter between Ghanaians and Zambians.
This revived a cultural movement on social media, with Ghanaians informally declaring ""Fugu Friday"" to showcase the outfits. Fridays had been designated by the previous government as a day where people were encouraged to wear traditional clothes.
The debate prompted Ghanaians, including MPs, to flood social media proudly showcasing their fugus, while Zambians featured wearing their traditional outfits known as siziba.
The online exchange attracted the attention of Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, who announced that his country would order fugus from Ghana.
President Mahama also suggested exporting the smock in bulk to Zambia.
While emphasising the fugu's cultural and political significance, Mahama gave a nod to Nkrumah and how he had worn it in 1957 and said that he himself had recently worn it proudly to the UN.
Other presidents, including Nana Akufo-Addo, John Kufuor and Jerry John Rawlings, have also embraced and publicly promoted the outfit.

Bid launched to extend Zimbabwe president's term in office,2026-02-10T20:08:01.787Z," Shingai Nyoka
Harare
","Zimbabwe's cabinet has approved draft legislation that would allow President Emmerson Mnangagwa, 83, to extend his stay in office until at least 2030.
Presidents would be chosen by MPs rather than in a direct vote and could serve a maximum of two seven-year terms, rather than the current five-year terms, under the proposals.
Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi said public consultations would be held before the bill heads to parliament for debate, where both chambers are dominated by the ruling Zanu-PF party.
Legal challenges are likely as constitutional experts argue a referendum is needed if term limits are changed - and also point out that such amendments cannot benefit a sitting president.
Mnangagwa, who first came to power in 2017 after a military coup ousted long-time leader Robert Mugabe, won a presidential election the next year and a second term in 2023 - though the results were disputed.
Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political cunning, his final five-year term is due to expire in 2028.
In a referendum held 13 years ago, Zimbabweans overwhelmingly voted for a new constitution that introduced presidential term limits when Mugabe's grip on power seemed entrenched - he had ruled the country since independence in 1980.
Hints that Mnangagwa, who was once Mugabe's deputy until they fell out over the growing political ambitions of the then-first lady, wanted to stay in power beyond 2028 started two years ago.
The slogan ""2030 he will still be the leader"" began to be chanted at Zanu-PF rallies with his supporters saying he needed to remain in office to complete his ""Agenda 2030"" development programme - though President Mnangagwa publicly rejected the idea.
He has faced some fierce detractors within Zanu-PF, but his main critic - Blessed Geza, also known as ""Bombshell"" - died last week.
This time last year Geza, a respected veteran of the 1970s war of independence and then member of Zanu-PF's powerful central committee, had launched a scathing attack on Mnangagwa's ambition to stay in power.
He apologised for helping him come into office and accused the president of nepotism in his bid to stay in office beyond 2028.
Zanu-PF expelled Geza from the party for disloyalty and he was forced into hiding.
Yet he continued to attract a large following on social media, where he regularly posted videos calling for protests.
Hours before his death a message posted on his social media pages urged Zimbabweans to carry forward the ""noble war"" to remove President Mnangagwa and ""end the plunder of our country"".
He was in South Africa when his family announced his death on Friday.
""At a time when silence would have been easier, he chose to speak out against corruption and nepotism that continue to undermine the promise of independence,"" Andrease Ethan Mathibela, national chairman of the influential Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association, said.
The government is now forging forward with its 2030 plans for Mnangagwa and says the intention behind the draft law is to strengthen governance and bring political stability.

"Son of Zambia's ex-President Lungu ordered to surrender 79 cars, petrol station and 'luxury' flats",2026-02-10T17:34:46.011Z," Kennedy Gondwe
Lusaka
","Zambia's High Court has ordered the seizure of assets worth more than $1.3m (£923,000) from Dalitso Lungu, the son of former President Edgar Lungu.
The forfeiture order covers 79 vehicles and 23 pieces of land and real estate, including a shopping mall, petrol station, ""luxury apartments and an executive residence"" in the capital, Lusaka.
The judgement said the 39-year-old and his company had failed to provide a credible and verifiable explanation for how the assets were acquired lawfully.
Edgar Lungu, who led Zambia for six years from 2015, died in South Africa last June but has yet to be buried because of an ongoing legal battle between his family and the current government.
It follows a long-standing feud between Lungu and his successor, President Hakainde Hichilema, who defeated him in the 2021 elections by a huge margin.
Hichilema's government wants his remains to be repatriated and given a state funeral, with full state honours - and a South African court ruled in their favour in August.
But the family wants a private burial in South Africa as they say the former president had not wanted Hichilema to attend his funeral.
Dalitso Lungu's lawyers have indicated they will appeal against Monday's ruling by the Economic and Financial Crimes Division of the High Court.
In assessing Lungu's financial capacity, the court examined his employment history and income.
Evidence showed that he worked briefly at a beverages company in Lusaka in 2012 and later spent nearly three years at the Zambia Revenue Authority.
The court concluded that his earnings were insufficient, even when taken together, to account for the acquisition of the extensive fleet of vehicles and high-value properties.
Investigations into his company, Saloid Traders Limited, found that its financial statements, tax returns, bank records and social security contributions did not demonstrate the capacity to lawfully acquire or maintain the assets in question.
Claims that the properties were financed through commercial farming, business income or family support were rejected, with the court noting the absence of supporting documentation.
""[Dalitso] Lungu has failed to proffer further and solid evidence to substantiate his claims that Mr Edgar Chagwa Lungu, and indeed his parents, were the source of the funds used to purchase the impugned properties,"" the judges ruled.
Other members of the Lungu family have also been investigated in recent years for allegedly accruing wealth fraudulently.
In 2024, the high court ruled that the former first lady, Esther Lungu, had to forfeit 15 flats valued at $3.5m.
Critics say the anti-corruption drive is politically motivated.
Mrs Lungu has remained in South Africa since the death of her husband from an undisclosed illness.
She is leading legal efforts to have him buried in South Africa - and has just filed a notice at the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein to overturn the earlier ruling that her husband's body be sent back home.
The family's earlier attempts at various other South African courts for leave to appeal had failed.
Lungu's body remains in a funeral home in Johannesburg.

Pilot praised after crash-landing faulty Somali passenger plane on seashore,2026-02-10T16:16:30.165Z," Abdinasir Ali
BBC Somali
","An airline in Somalia has praised one of its pilots after he crash-landed his passenger plane, which had suffered a technical fault, on the shoreline next to the capital's international airport with all 55 on board surviving.
Starsky Aviation said the pilot's quick thinking was crucial in saving the 50 passengers and five crew.
The crew of the aircraft, a Fokker 50, reported a problem shortly after take off from Mogadishu on Tuesday morning and requested that the plane return, Somalia's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said.
It then touched down but failed to stop on the runway, overshooting the tarmac before coming to rest in shallow water, the CAA's director Ahmed Macalin Hassan said.
It is not clear yet exactly what the issue was.
Footage posted on X appeared to show passengers leaving the aircraft and walking away from the wreckage on the shore of the Indian Ocean. No serious injuries have been reported.
The African Union's mission in Somalia said UN and AU troops were ""swiftly deployed"" to help with rescue efforts. Somalia's transport minister was also at the scene, its post on X added.
""We are relieved to confirm that all passengers and crew are safe. Investigations are under way to establish what caused the technical issue that led to the emergency landing,"" Starsky spokesman Hassan Mohamed Aden said.
""The pilot's swift and calm decision-making played a decisive role in ensuring the safety of everyone on board, and we commend him for how he handled the situation,"" he added.

Eswatini angers Madagascar junta for hosting deposed leader,2026-02-10T10:34:57.651Z," Wycliffe Muia
","Madagascar's military government has criticised Eswatini for hosting ousted President Andry Rajoelina last week, describing the visit as a ""grave infringement of its sovereignty"".
Last Friday, the Eswatini government shared photos of King Mswati III meeting Rajoelina, during which the king called on Madagascar's military junta to restore constitutional order.
In a statement, Madagascar's military leader Col Michael Randrianirina voiced his ""strongest condemnation"" of the visit, terming it ""politically unacceptable"".
Rajoelina was overthrown last October by an elite military following weeks of youth-led protests in the Indian Ocean island.
The demonstrations were over persistent power and water shortages, culminating in the army siding with the demonstrators.
This was the first time the ousted president was seen in a diplomatic engagement since fleeing Madagascar.
King Mswati III's office said the meeting with Rajoelina was part of Eswatini's role as a facilitator in regional diplomacy and was not intended to interfere in Madagascar's domestic politics.
In a statement, the military in Madagascar said Rajoelina had voluntarily renounced his Malagasy nationality after acquiring another citizenship, warning that any attempt to portray himself as a legitimate representative of Madagascar was ""legally unfounded"".
""This situation is of particular gravity in so far as the individual concerned was serving as head of state during the tragic events of September and October 2025, which claimed the lives of approximately 30 Malagasy citizens,"" the statement added.
The military authorities said Rajoelina's reception in Eswatini could potentially disrupt the ongoing national reconciliation and constitutional restoration process in Madagascar.
In a response on Monday, Percy Simelane, the monarchy's spokesperson said the deposed leader was not seeking ""protection or intervention"" from the Kingdom of Eswatini.
Simelane said the king had consulted with the regional bloc, Southern African Development Community (Sadc), before meeting Rajoelina.
""The attack on the people of Eswatini is therefore misguided and unfortunate,"" he added.
Randrianirina has pledged to call new elections within two years.
Last December, Sadc directed Madagascar's military authorities to submit, by 28 February, a roadmap for restoring democracy, including plans for fresh elections.

Eritrea accuses Ethiopia of fabricating report its troops had crossed the border,2026-02-09T10:35:34.984Z," Damian Zane
","Eritrea has hit back at its neighbour Ethiopia describing accusations that its troops were on Ethiopian territory as ""false"".
On Saturday, a letter sent from Ethiopia's foreign minister to his Eritrean counterpart demanded that the soldiers withdraw.
It also accused Eritrea of ""outright aggression"" saying it was conducting joint manoeuvres with Ethiopian rebels in the north and supplying them with weapons. In its response Eritrea said this was part of a ""spiral of hostile campaigns against Eritrea for more than two years"".
There has long been a history of tension between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which split off from its larger neighbour three decades ago, and there are fears of a renewed conflict.
The countries fought a border war between 1998-2000 in which more than 100,000 people died. A peace deal was never fully implemented and relations only eased after Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who later won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, travelled to the Eritrean capital, Asmara, in 2018.
The two had been allies in Ethiopia's recent civil war when Eritrea supported its army against Tigrayan forces, but things have once again soured.
""Developments over the last few days indicate that the Government of Eritrea has chosen the path of further escalation,"" Ethiopia Foreign Minister Gedion Timothewos's letter alleged.
""The incursion of Eritrean troops further into Ethiopian territory in our north-eastern borders and the joint military manoeuvres being carried out by Eritrean forces with rebel groups in our north-western borders are not just provocations but acts of outright aggression.""
One of the points of tension is the call from landlocked Ethiopia for access to the sea, which Abiy has described as an existential matter. He said that losing a port as a result of Eritrean independence was a ""mistake"".
In his letter, the foreign minister said that if Eritrea's soldiers withdraw then the two countries could start talks including over ""the issue of access to the sea through the port of Assab"".
In its response, Eritrea's information ministry said the ""patently false and fabricated accusations... [were] astounding in its tone and substance, underlying motivation, and overarching objective.
""As underlined before, the Government of Eritrea has no appetite for, or desire to, engage in meaningless acrimony to add fuel and exacerbate the situation.""
Last week, in a further sign of deteriorating relations, Abiy said for the first time that during to the 2020-2022 civil war in Tigray Eritrean troops had massacred people in the Ethiopian city Aksum. These were allegations Eritrea had previously denied following reports of mass killings that took place in the historic city in November 2020.
In shifting alliances, Ethiopia now says that Eritrea is supporting rebels in Tigray who oppose the peace deal that ended the civil war.
Last month, Ethiopian police said they seized thousands of rounds of ammunition sent by Eritrea to rebels.
Eritrea denied the allegation and accused Ethiopia of ""floating false flags to justify the war that it has been itching to unleash for two long years"".

'Colossus' of Ghanaian highlife music Ebo Taylor dies at 90,2026-02-09T08:51:59.733Z," Mark Wilberforce
Accra
","Ebo Taylor, the Ghanaian guitarist, composer and band leader whose work helped define the highlife genre and influenced generations of African musicians, has died at the age of 90, his family has announced.
Born Deroy Taylor in the city of Cape Coast in 1936, he rose to prominence during the late 1950s and early 1960s as highlife became Ghana's dominant musical form.
Over a six-decade career, he fused Ghanaian rhythms with jazz, funk, soul and early Afrobeat and went on to inspire musicians beyond the continent.
Presidential spokesperson Felix Kwakye Ofosu said the government and people of Ghana were ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of this ""colossus"" of the country's music.
In his early years as a performer, Taylor played with the era's leading bands, including the Stargazers and the Broadway Dance Band, and gained a reputation for a distinctive guitar style and detailed arrangements.
In the last 25 years of his life, his music was rediscovered by a global audience with the release of tracks like Love & Death – his reflection on relationships and mortality – driving a fresh host of fans.
A formative period in Taylor's musical development came in the early 1960s when he travelled to London to study music.
There, he worked alongside other African musicians, including Nigerian artist Fela Kuti.
Their collaboration is now viewed as part of a wider exchange of ideas that helped shape Afrobeat, the genre Fela would later bring to international attention, with highlife playing a significant role in its musical foundations.
On his return to Ghana, Taylor became a sought-after band leader, arranger and producer, working with some of the country's most respected artists, including Pat Thomas and CK Mann.
Reflecting on his own influences, he told the BBC in 2014 that ""with the advent of James Brown and funk music there was the opportunity to develop highlife music. Fela did a lot of work introducing the funk into the Yoruba music while comparatively I did almost the same thing in Ghana.""
Towards the end of the last century and the beginning of this, Taylor spent more time teaching music at the University of Ghana and working on other people's output, the New York Times reported.
But he then returned to the studio and his new recordings began to attract attention well into later life, with albums such as Love & Death, Appia Kwa Bridge and Yen Ara reinforcing his standing as one of Ghana's most important musical figures.
Taylor's influence extended far beyond highlife.
In recent decades, his work has been taken up by international audiences through sampling, with elements of his recordings appearing in songs by artists across hip-hop and R&B.
Tracks including Heaven, Odofo Nyi Akyiri Biara and Love & Death have been sampled by performers including Usher, the Black Eyed Peas, Kelly Rowland, Jidenna, Vic Mensa and Rapsody, introducing his music to new listeners worldwide.
Talking about achieving wider recognition in his 70s he said: ""I think I've had my day, though it came much later.""
In his tribute, top Ghanaian music producer Panji Anoff remembered how everybody used to call him ""Uncle Ebo"" but he treated everyone as an equal.
""He would sit with us, eat with us, drink and chill with us, some nearly 50 years his junior, as though we were all peers. He could relate with everybody, and if anybody ever needed a melody, Uncle Ebo would just plug in a guitar and show them the way,"" Anoff told the BBC.
""We lost a legend whose contribution to music has created worldwide ripples. I take solace in the fact that I witnessed greatness in Uncle Ebo Taylor's art form. Rest In Power!"" singer and rapper Black Sherif said.
Reflecting on Taylor's influence Shatta Wale said that ""his sound, vision and cultural impact opened doors for countless artists across Africa and beyond"".
""He will be remembered as one of our greatest musicians ever... as a man who strove to put Ghanaian music on the global map at a time when other genres of music were prominent,"" presidential spokesperson Ofosu told the BBC's Newsday programme.
Across Ghana and the wider African diaspora, Taylor is recognised as a foundational figure whose work helped bridge traditional and modern sounds.
By grounding innovation in cultural continuity, he left behind a body of music that continues to inform contemporary styles, including afrobeats, and remains central to the story of African popular music.

Senegal arrests 14 members of alleged paedophile gang linked to France,2026-02-09T08:08:09.397Z," Basillioh Rukanga
","Senegalese police say they have arrested 14 people and broken up a paedophile gang operating between the country and France.
Those arrested, who are all Senegalese, were part of a ""transnational"" criminal group that has been in operation since 2017, according to a police statement.
It said the group was accused of ""organised paedophilia, pimping, rape of minors under 15, sodomy, and intentional transmission of HIV/Aids"". They allegedly repeatedly forced boys to have ""unprotected sex"" with men who were mostly HIV-positive and filmed it.
Four of the accused are said to have been acting ""on the instructions"" of a Frenchman arrested in France in April 2025 ""in exchange for money transfers"".
The 14 accused were brought before a judge on Friday following searches in several neighbourhoods in Dakar, and the city of Kaolack, 200km (124 miles) south-east of the capital.
A police statement released on Sunday said coordinated raids had been carried out at the homes of the various suspects, with items believed to be linked to the alleged crimes seized.
""The DIC [Criminal Investigations Division] carried out a major operation, dismantling a transnational organised criminal group whose members are based primarily between France and Senegal,"" the police said.
The statement said the operation was conducted through cooperation between Senegal and France, with a delegation of French officers involved in the mission.
The police have pledged to continue pursuing and dismantling such criminal networks and have released a toll-free number for the public to report any relevant information.

How off-the-shelf drones are changing jihadist warfare in West Africa,2026-02-09T00:09:18.681Z," Makuochi Okafor
BBC Africa
Lagos
","Jihadist groups are increasingly carrying out drone strikes in West Africa, raising alarm that they are building the capacity to wage a ""war from the skies"".
A leading violence monitoring organisation, Acled, has recorded at least 69 drone strikes by an al-Qaeda affiliate in Burkina Faso and Mali since 2023, while two Islamic State (IS) affiliates have carried out around 20 - mostly in Nigeria, which has been battling numerous insurgent groups for almost 25 years.
The latest drone attack took place in Nigeria's north-eastern Borno state on 29 January, when jihadists carried out a two-pronged assault - with multiple armed drones and ground fighters - on a military base.
The military said nine of its soldiers were killed in the attack by the Islamic State of West Africa Province (Iswap) - identified by Acled as the ""most prolific"" IS African affiliate in ""drone warfare"".
The jihadists tended to carry out strikes with ""commercially available, relatively inexpensive quadcopter [unmanned] drones"" that were ""rigged with explosives"", while also using them for reconnaissance and surveillance missions in preparation for ground attacks, Acled senior Africa analyst Ladd Serwat told the BBC.
Despite the fact that Nigeria's government tightly controls the import of commercial and hobby drones and prohibits their use without official permission, the jihadists were able to obtain them through their smuggling networks across the region's porous borders, said a Nigeria-based senior researcher at the Good Governance Africa think-tank, Malik Samuel.
""The growing use of armed and surveillance drones by violent extremist groups in the Sahel and Lake Chad region is deeply concerning, and it marks a significant shift,"" security analyst Audu Bulama Bukarti told the BBC.
""Drones lower the cost of conducting attacks, allow militants to gather intelligence with minimal risk and enable strikes on military targets that were previously harder to reach,"" he added.
According to Serwat, Iswap has carried out 10 drone strikes since 2024 in north-eastern Nigeria as well as in northern Cameroon, southern Niger, and southern Chad - all countries affected by the insurgency in Nigeria.
A similar number of drone attacks were carried out by another IS affiliate, the Islamic State of Sahel Province (ISSP), in West Africa, Acled data shows.
In its latest attack, ISSP carried out an assault on the international airport in Niger's capital, Niamey, and nearby military bases, also on 29 January, with the defence ministry saying that four military personnel were injured and 20 of the assailants were killed.
Serwat said that while some reports claim ISSP used mortars and RPGs, others suggest that the militants carried out a drone strike.
""If a drone was used, this represents the first time ISSP used an explosive-laden drone in Niger,"" he added.
The jihadist group that has used drones the most is the al-Qaeda-affiliated Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). Acled says it has carried 69 strikes in neighbours Mali and Burkina Faso, and one across the border in Togo.
""JNIM's drone programme has developed rapidly and spread across interconnected networks in Mali and Burkina,"" Acled's senior West Africa analyst Héni Nsaibia said.
Military Africa, an online defence industry source, reported that last February, JNIM had also used what are known as first-person view (FPV) drones - when the pilot has a live feed from the drone - to drop improvised explosive devices, made from plastic bottles, onto military positions in Burkina Faso's Djibo town.
""This marked a significant escalation, as FPV drones - small, agile, and often used in Ukraine - allow precise targeting,"" Military Africa reported.
Samuel said the jihadist groups were influenced and trained by foreign fighters to constantly adopt new methods - from making roadside bombs and suicide belts, they had now learned to turn ""off-the-shelf"" drones into weapons.
Drone attacks could reduce casualties among jihadists, while achieving greater ""effectiveness"" in hitting targets, Samuel said.
Acled analyst Nsaibia told the BBC that while the majority of JNIM's drone attacks in Mali and Burkina Faso had targeted the military and allied militias, some had also hit civilians, including markets in communities perceived as being aligned with government forces.
As for Iswap, it was known to have carried out only one drone attack that hit civilians - in June 2025, when two pastoralists were killed and one injured in northern Cameroon, Nsaibia said.
In a report last year, a researcher at the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies, Taiwo Adebayo, wrote that to combat the threat, West African armies needed to carry out ""preemptive strikes"" to destroy drone assembly and launch sites, and acquire more counter-drone technology, including jamming devices and air defence systems.
Otherwise, he warned, the jihadists could enhance their drone warfare capabilities and carry out ""high-impact assaults"" that could worsen instability in West Africa.

Man named in South Africa's police corruption probe found dead,2026-02-08T11:31:24.546Z," Damian Zane
","A South African man named in a major police corruption probe has died after reportedly shooting himself at a petrol station.
Police are now investigating the death of Wiandre Pretorius, 41, who last week said he had survived an assassination attempt.
Pretorius's name had been mentioned at the ongoing corruption inquiry, known as the Madlanga Commission. This was in connection with the 2022 murder of a man, Emmanuel Mbense, allegedly at the hands of police officers.
Four of the 12 people named as persons of interest in that killing are now dead themselves, a police spokesperson said.
At 22:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Saturday the police received reports that a man had taken his own life at a petrol station in Brakpan, east of Johannesburg. At the scene, officers found Pretorius's body with a firearm next to it, spokesperson Brig Athlenda Mathe said.
The police are now looking at CCTV footage to confirm what happened. There had been reports that Pretorius had been involved in a row with his fiancée at the petrol station before taking his own life.
The murder four years ago of Mbense is one of several issues that has come up at the Madlanga Commission, which was set up by President Cyril Ramaphosa after a senior police officer alleged that organised crime groups had infiltrated the government.
At a hearing last year, a man, only identified at the time as Witness D, said that in 2022 he had been ordered to get rid of the body of someone accused of robbery who had allegedly been tortured and killed by police officers.
Witness D also alleged that Pretorius, who was not a policeman but had previously served as a police reservist, was involved.
The witness, later named as Marius van der Merwe, was shot death three weeks after testifying.
Police spokesperson Mathe said on Sunday that Pretorius had been questioned and his firearms confiscated in connection with Van der Merwe's killing.
Mathe added that the death of Pretorius on Saturday night leaves only eight of the original 12 persons of interest in the killing of Mbense still alive.
Three were killed ""execution style"" – one in 2023 and two last year.
""The question is: are we dealing with a syndicate that is eliminating each other in relation to the Emmanel Mbense murder? That is what our detectives are probing,"" Mathe told reporters.
Last week, police began investigating whether Pretorius himself had been the target of an assassination attempt after he said that his vehicle had been shot at.
In connection with the murder of Mbense, Mathe said that ""arrests are imminent"" following an investigation by the independent police watchdog body.

King Charles to host Nigeria's first UK state visit in 37 years,2026-02-07T23:00:44.306Z," Alicia Curry
","King Charles III and Queen Camilla will host Nigeria's president in the country's first state visit to the UK in 37 years, Buckingham Palace has announced.
Bola Tinubu and First Lady Oluremi Tinubu have accepted an invitation to be guests of the King at Windsor Castle from 18 to 19 March.
State visits are considered a form of soft-power diplomacy, using the pomp of royal hospitality to strengthen relations with important international partners.
The last Nigerian state visit to the UK took place in 1989, when military ruler Gen Ibrahim Babangida travelled to meet the late Queen Elizabeth II for a four-day trip.
Although this will be Tinubu's first formal state visit to the UK, he has already met the King since taking office following Nigeria's disputed election in 2023.
Tinubu and his wife were received at Buckingham Palace in September 2024 and also held a bilateral meeting with the King on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai.
But a state visit allows for ceremonial pageantry aimed at elevating the occasion and demonstrating the importance with which the UK views those visiting.
The visit comes at a time of improving diplomatic and economic links between the UK and Nigeria - with trade between the two worth more than £8bn in the year to October, government figures show. This makes the African nation one of the UK's most important partners in the continent.
In 2024, the two countries signed a new trade and investment partnership designed to expand opportunities for business.
The agenda for the March visit has not been disclosed, nor details of the events planned for it - but state visits typically include carriage processions and a state banquet, and usually coincide with visiting leaders having political meetings.
In 2025 alone, the King presided over three state visits - those of French President Emmanuel Macron, US President Donald Trump and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier - the first time the UK had held such a number in a single year since 1988.
The King has longstanding ties to Nigeria, a Commonwealth country, having expressed a love for Pidgin English and Nigerian Afrobeats music.
Before coming monarch, he visited the country four times as the Prince of Wales - in 1990, 1999, 2006 and 2018. Camilla, then the Duchess of Cornwall, joined him on the latter trip.
In 2023, the King's Trust International - formerly the Prince's Trust - officially launched in Nigeria, announcing a project aimed at tackling youth unemployment.

Zambian leader backs traditional Ghanaian outfit after online trolling,2026-02-07T09:54:55.880Z," Jean Otalor
","Zambia's president has weighed into a cultural debate that has erupted online after the president of Ghana arrived in Zambia wearing a traditional outfit called a fugu. Some Zambians mockingly called it a ""blouse"".
But Zambia's leader hit back by sharing his love for the design, saying he would be ""ordering more of that stuff"" for himself, in a video posted on X from the Ghana–Zambia Business Forum held in Lusaka this week.
Ghana's foreign minister said the social media buzz was a sign that young people were keen to reclaim their cultural roots.
In Ghana itself, a move to encourage traditional outfits has led to ""Fugu Friday"", which sees people wear African clothing.
Following days of online back and forth between netizens of the two countries, President Hakainde Hichilema expressed his admiration for the Ghanaian outfit.
""We'll be ordering more fugu from Ghana following the social media conversations,"" Hichilema said on Friday in Zambia's capital, Lusaka.
When Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama arrived for a three-day State Visit on Wednesday, he was proudly sporting a fugu - a traditional northern Ghanaian outfit made from hand‑woven, narrow strips of thick cotton fabric stitched together to form a structured, poncho‑style garment.
In contrast, his Zambian counterparts was wearing a suit and tie to welcome him at the airport.
This elicited a strong reaction from some Zambians online, for example there were dozens of mocking comments on the Zambian Scorpion Facebook group.
Malama Mulenga referred to the fugu as a ''maternity blouse'', Mwangala Imbula posted: ''Am coming to get that blouse'', while Master G wrote ''We love our blouse brothers''.
Ghanaian officials attending the forum responded by highlighting the deep cultural significance of the fugu.
Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa described it as not just an item of clothing but a symbol of African identity, dignity, and heritage.
In a video posted on Facebook, he said that the viral buzz had sparked renewed interest among young people and ignited what he called a renaissance of the ""African personality"". He encouraged Africans to reclaim and celebrate their cultural roots.
""For the young ones on social media who want to know more about the attire… this is the attire that the founder of Ghana, Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah, wore when he declared independence on the 6th of March 1957 in Ghana,"" he said.
A popular Ghanaian YouTuber also threw his hat into the debate.
Wode Maya declared that it was not a ''blouse'', and that ''the president is intentionally promoting the local garment industry both within and beyond our borders''.
He added that ''it is unfortunate that many of you, despite having access to smartphones and the internet, still choose to remain ignorant''.

'They sent a letter asking to preach. Then they massacred us' - Nigerians on jihadist attack,2026-02-06T15:58:43.097Z," Makuochi Okafor
BBC Africa
Lagos
","More than 100 armed jihadists dressed in army fatigues rode into the neighbouring Muslim villages of Woro and Nuku in Nigeria's western state of Kwara on motorbikes - driven by revenge.
""They came en masse in the name of religion, and they decided to kill our people,"" Abdulla Umar Usman, a former teacher and resident of Woro, told the BBC, explaining how the attack, in which at least 75 people are so far known to have been killed, unfolded.
The mayhem started an hour before sunset on Tuesday as residents of the farming community were heading home from their fields, where they grow yams, maize and millet.
The militants headed straight to the home of traditional leader Umar Bio Salihu - because they had written to him asking if they could come and preach what is considered an extremist version of Islam, which the community did not welcome.
Salihu was not at his home in Woro at the time, so they set his compound alight and killed two of his children.
""Two of the community head's children, who were medical students, were killed in front of the house before they set it ablaze,"" Usman said.
The jihadists then went on a killing spree that lasted all night.
""They massacred everyone. It is just devastating,"" Mohammed Dauda, a local official, told the BBC.
Amnesty International said many of the dead had been found with their hands and feet tied - some had had their throats slit, others had been shot dead.
When the jihadists left in the morning, they took with them 38 women and children, including the rest of the traditional ruler's family.
""They killed two of my children and abducted my wife and three children,"" Salihu told me.
The militants wanted residents to renounce the Nigerian government and its constitution and instead follow their teachings, effectively attempting to impose a parallel system of rule and government in the area.
This was ""against what the Quran teaches"", Salihu said, referring to Islam's holy book.
The Nigerian government has blamed Boko Haram for the attack - the jihadist group has not issued any statement about it.
Boko Haram, which gained global attention in 2014 after abducting more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok, is still operating in the north-east of the country but has since splintered.
One of its factions, Mahmuda, is now active in rural parts of Kwara and the neighbouring state of Niger.
According to Amnesty, the jihadists had been leafleting the two villages for the last five months.
""These communities have been receiving these pamphlets, soliciting them to join the extremist views and preaching by these militants,"" Isa Sanusi, head of Amnesty International in Nigeria, told the BBC's Newsday programme.
""After they see a bit of resistance from the people, they then started sending them warnings,"" he added.
This correlates with Usman's account - that locals had received warnings days before the violence began.
Local MP Saidu Baba Ahmed told the BBC the latest communication had been sent to Salihu, who had contacted the security forces about the letter.
The military went to the area briefly to investigate, but after they left, the jihadists launched their assault, he said.
Amnesty says this shows a ""stunning security failure"".
""We are wondering why this security lapse was allowed to happen, why the authorities could not take action,"" Sanusi said.
He described how over many hours no-one went to the villagers' aid - and the militants were able to ""take their time"".
""In fact, they even went to the mosque and prayed there. They forced a few people to go and listen to their preaching. That means they had enough time… adequate time to do whatever they liked,"" Sanusi added.
The security forces did arrive the next day to find large parts of Woro and Nuku, which fall under the administrative area of Kaiama, in ruins.
Shops and homes had been burnt, abandoned motorcycles lined the streets and smoke still hung in the air.
The once-busy market stalls stood empty, as families gathered to comfort one another.
Then began the grim task of burying the bodies - first recovering them from the bushes.
Dauda, the local official, said he accompanied soldiers and helped bury dozens of victims.
""I was among those who buried 30 corpses,"" he said. ""We have never experienced this before in Kaiama local government area.""
Residents say the men assigned to dig graves for mass burials worked throughout the day until they became exhausted and were unable to continue.
It has left mourners in Woro and Nuku physically and emotionally broken.
Even now the dusty red-sand roads around the town remain deserted.
Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, who visited the area on Wednesday night, said President Bola Tinubu had approved the immediate deployment of an army battalion to respond to the attack.
Usman suspects the attackers emerged from the forested areas near the Kainji Lake National Park, where the militants are known to operate.
He said the military had carried out operations in nearby forests months to target armed groups.
Communities in Kwara are also vulnerable to raids by criminal gangs - known locally as ""bandits"" - who loot and kidnap for ransom and have moved into the religiously diverse state fairly recently.
This has led most settlements in rural areas to set up vigilante groups – small bands of armed men who protect their villages.
In fact, according to the MP, the militants had tried to attack the villages last year but had been fought off by the vigilantes.
What leaves the residents of Woro and Nuku in such distress this time is that the jihadists knew exactly where the vigilantes lived - and picked them off not long after dealing with the house of the traditional leader.
""They knew where they were and they went straight to attack them,"" Salihu said.
""They burnt them into ashes… about eight of them.""

Nigerian court orders UK to pay £420m over 1949 killing of miners,2026-02-06T15:50:35.011Z," Jean Otalor
","A Nigerian court has ordered the British government to pay $27m (£20m) to each of the families of 21 coal miners killed in 1949 by the colonial administration in the south-east of the country.
The colonial police, made up of Nigerians and Europeans, shot dead workers striking for better conditions. Dozens more were injured in what the state-run News Agency of Nigeria described as one of the most notorious acts of repression under British rule in Nigeria.
Historians say the killing helped galvanise support for the burgeoning anti-colonial movement that led to independence 11 years later, in 1960.
The UK government said it had not been formally notified of the judgement and so could not comment.
The UK had not been represented in the proceedings, a spokesperson told the BBC.
Families and rights groups have led a decades-long campaign for official acknowledgment and compensation.
The ruling, delivered by Justice Anthony Onovo in Enugu, described the massacre as unlawful and extrajudicial violation of the right to life, NAN reports.
According to him, the British government must be held accountable and must make reparations to the victims' families.
""These defenceless coal miners were asking for improved work conditions, they were not embarking on any violent action against the authorities, but yet were shot and killed,"" Onovo told the Enugu High Court.
The workers at the Iva Valley coal mine were protesting against harsh working conditions, racial disparities in wages and unpaid back wages.
When their demands were not met, they adopted a ""go-slow"" protest and occupied the mine to prevent management from locking them out, NAN reports.
The suit was brought by human rights activist, Mazi Greg Onoh, who listed the British and Nigerian governments as respondents.
""This ruling represents a significant milestone in the pursuit of historical accountability and justice for colonial-era violations, affirming that the right to life transcends time, borders, and changes in sovereignty,"" said the applicants' lawyer, Prof Yemi Akinseye-George.
The killings took place on 18 November 1949 in Enugu, which was the administrative capital of the Eastern Region of British-administered Nigeria at the time.
Historian Dr Oludamola Adebowale told the BBC it was a ""trigger-point"" for the independence movement.
""Calls for independence already exist[ed] and talks [were] ongoing. The massacre was a reference point for people outlining the need for the colonialists to go,"" he said.
During an official investigation at the time, the police defended the shootings by saying they feared being overwhelmed.
But among those that the inquiry blamed were the colonialists in charge of the police for inflaming the situation.
Those killed are now celebrated in the region as heroes.

Fisherman fleeing elephants killed by crocodile in Zambia,2026-02-06T14:47:22.583Z," Wycliffe Muia
","A 52-year-old fisherman has died after being attacked by a crocodile while fleeing a herd of elephants in eastern Zambia, police say.
Dean Nyirenda was returning from a fishing trip with two friends on Wednesday when they bumped into the elephants. They ran away, with Nyirenda diving into a stream near the Luangwa River.
""That is when he was attacked by a crocodile by biting his right thigh,"" local police chief Robertson Mweemba told journalists.
The southern African country has a thriving elephant population and clashes between humans and wildlife have claimed many lives in recent years.
Police said Nyirenda had managed to escape the crocodile by hitting it with a stick which he had in his hands.
""He dragged himself from the stream,"" said Mweemba
His two fellow fishermen, who had been watching from a distance, went to help him and carried him from the riverbank while he was bleeding heavily, state-run ZNBC news website reported.
""They tried to stop the bleeding but unfortunately he died,"" added the police chief.
Wildlife officers later visited the scene and found deep bite marks on the fisherman's right thigh, which had led to the fatal bleeding.
The BBC has reached out to the authorities for comment.
The Luangwa River, which flows through Zambia's South Luangwa National Park, is home to one of the highest concentrations of Nile crocodiles in Africa, according to conservationists.
Of the 26 wildlife-related deaths recorded in 2023, 15 were caused by crocodile attacks, most of them along the Luangwa River, according to Resource Africa, a community-led conservation NGO.
Zambian authorities have previously called on locals and tourists to exercise extreme caution when travelling through the country's wildlife hotspots.
Wildlife authorities say they have been considering measures to reduce the human-animal conflicts, including building protective fences near wildlife areas.

Remaining worshippers kidnapped in Nigeria church abduction freed,2026-02-05T17:05:51.233Z," Makuochi Okafor
BBC Africa
Lagos
","All the worshippers kidnapped by gunmen from churches in a village in Nigeria's northern Kaduna state have now been released more than a fortnight after their abduction, according to officials.
Gunmen raided Kurmin Wali on 18 January as services were going on. Residents told the BBC that 177 people were taken away in all, with 11 escaping shortly after.
A further 80, who had fled from their captors and hid in neighbouring villages for fear of being taken again, returned home earlier this week.
The police have not revealed what led to the release of the last group of victims. It is not clear who was responsible, but the mass abduction was part of a wave of kidnappings that has hit the country.
Last month's raid was initially denied by police, who only confirmed the details two days later.
The official response drew criticism from Amnesty International, which accused Nigerian authorities of ""desperate denial"".
Kaduna state governor Uba Sani released a statement on X, saying those freed will be reunited with their families in “due course”.
”They will be medically and psychologically certified fit... and reclaim the rhythms of normal life,” he wrote.
The BBC asked the police for more details about what led to the release but did not get a response.
Rev John Hayab, president of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Northern Nigeria, said the community was ""celebrating [the abductees'] safe return"" and their ""rescue"", adding that people had ""been in pain"" worrying about their situation in the bush.
Hayab said the freed worshippers were at the headquarters of the intelligence police in Kaduna, where they were undergoing medical checks.
""So far, I think they are in good shape,"" he said.
He also said they were ""grateful to the government and security agencies for whatever they did and how they went about it"".
Nigeria faces multiple, overlapping security challenges beyond kidnappings, including an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and frequent clashes between herders and farmers in central regions over land and water.
Security experts say efforts to tackle these crises are hampered by corruption, poor intelligence sharing and underfunded local police forces.
The security situation has drawn international attention. In December, the US conducted airstrikes in north-western Nigeria on Christmas Day, targeting two camps run by an Islamist militant group.
Following the action, President Donald Trump warned of further strikes if attacks on Christians in the West African nation continued.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is home to more than 250 ethnic groups and is roughly divided between a predominantly Muslim north and a largely Christian south, with significant mixing in central regions.
The government maintains that people of all faiths have been victims of the widespread violence.

"Dozens of Muslims 'massacred' in Nigeria for refusing to join jihadists, says governor",2026-02-05T14:37:14.609Z," Makuochi Okafor
BBC Africa
LagosandOttilie Mitchell
","Dozens of people have been killed in a ferocious shooting attack on two villages in Nigeria's western state of Kwara after they refused to ""surrender to extremists who preached a strange doctrine"", according to the state's governor.
Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq said on X that ""75 local Muslims were massacred"" in Tuesday's raid, while a state lawmaker told the BBC that 78 people had been buried so far and the death toll could rise to an estimated 170 as more corpses were being recovered.
Blaming Islamist militant group Boko Haram for the killings, President Bola Tinubu deployed an army battalion to the affected area.
The assault was one of several across Nigeria in the last few days.
In addition to the killings in the villages of Woro and Nuku, 38 people were abducted while others fled and shops and homes were set alight, said Saidu Baba Ahmed, a member of the Kwara state house of assembly.
Among the dead were two sons of the local traditional leader, who also had family members kidnapped, according to local resident Abdulla Umar Usman.
The attack began after 17:00 local time and last three to four hours, he told the BBC.
Ahmed said that Boko Haram activity had been gradually increasing in the area, saying the attack was triggered by the community's rejection of a strict interpretation of Islam.
He explained that the Islamist group had written to the community about their arrival, saying they wanted to preach, but residents resisted and deployed local security forces.
Details about the exact number of people who died in the remote area are hard to confirm.
A Red Cross official in Kwara, Babaomo Ayodeji, told AFP that ""reports said that the death toll now stands at 162, as the search for more bodies continues"".
Amnesty International said in a statement that over 170 people had died, noting many were shot at close range and some burnt alive.
The human rights group called for an investigation and said there was a ""stunning absence of any form of security for the protection of lives"".
In recent months, jihadists - suspected to be from a Boko Haram splinter faction - have been active in Kwara, carrying out targeted killings, often riding in on motorcycles and attacking markets and vigilante groups set up to protect villagers.
In a press release on Wednesday, the state governor said the attack on the two villages was a result of recent counter-terrorism operations in the region.
AbdulRazaq believed it was ""apparently to distract the security forces who have successfully hunted down several terrorist and kidnapping gangs"".
Tuesday also saw 21 people being killed in an attack on Doma village in Katsina state in the north, Amnesty said. On the same day 17 people were killed in a series of attacks in the north-eastern Borno state, by suspected Boko Haram militants.
The attacks come alongside the first official acknowledgement from Nigeria of an American troop presence since US President Donald Trump ordered the military in November to prepare for action in Nigeria to tackle Islamist militant groups.
Nigerian Defence Minister Chrisopher Musa did not provide any details about the team's size, arrival date, location or duration of stay.
His comments follow those made on Tuesday by Gen Dagvin Anderson of US Africa Command (Africom), who said the deployment followed a Nigerian request and was focused on intelligence support.
""Our partnership with Nigeria is a great example of a very willing and capable partner who requested the unique capabilities that only the US can bring,"" he said.
Nigeria faces an array of security challenges including criminal gangs - known locally as ""bandits"" who loot and kidnap for ransom - an Islamist insurgency, clashes over land and separatist unrest.
The US and Nigerian forces have conducted joint training programmes and exercises for decades.
But the US military has recently become more involved - launching airstrikes on Christmas Day on two camps run by the militant group known as Lakurawa in the north-west.
Late last year, the White House pressed Nigeria's government to improve security and strengthen protections for Christian communities.
Trump had previously claimed Christians were being persecuted in Nigeria - an allegation strongly rejected by Nigeria's government, which said Muslims, Christians and people of no faith were victims of attacks.
There are more than 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria, which is roughly divided into a mainly Muslim north, a largely Christian south, with intermingling in the middle.
Nigeria's Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar said the Christmas-Day strikes were approved by Tinubu and involved Nigerian forces.
Since then security co-operation between the two nations has increased - with the US saying last month that it had delivered critical supplies to support Nigeria's security efforts.
Nigeria's military then told the BBC the equipment had been purchased earlier to aid counter-insurgency operations.
In recent weeks, Nigerian forces have stepped up operations against armed groups.
On Sunday, the army said it had killed a senior Boko Haram commander and 10 other militants during an operation in Borno state.

Aid workers missing after airstrikes hit South Sudan hospital,2026-02-05T12:42:16.777Z," Wycliffe MuiaandAlfred Lasteck
","An unknown number of aid workers are missing after air strikes hit a hospital in South Sudan, near the Ethiopian border, a charity group says.
The hospital, run by medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Jonglei state, ""was hit in an air strike by the government of South Sudan forces during the night on Tuesday"", MSF said. The South Sudan government is yet to comment.
In a separate attack, MSF said its health facility in Pieri, also in Jonglei state, was on the same day looted by unknown assailants, leaving it ""unusable for the local community"".
""Our colleagues had to flee with the community and their fate and whereabouts are still unknown,"" the medical organisation said.
There has been a resurgence in fighting in Jonglei state recently between government forces and those loyal to First Vice-President Riek Machar, who has been suspended from his post after being accused of plotting to overthrow President Salva Kiir.
There are fears that the fighting could re-ignite a full-blown civil war in the world's youngest nation.
Jonglei, one of the most food-insecure parts of the country with severe health needs, has seen an estimated 280,000 people displaced by fighting and aerial bombardments since December, the UN said.
MSF said that ahead of Tuesday's first attack in the Lankien area, it had received information about a possible strike, so the hospital was ""evacuated and patients were discharged hours before the attack"".
""One staff member was injured, and the hospital's main warehouse was destroyed along with medical supplies,"" the group said in a statement.
Lankien has been at the centre of renewed fighting in recent weeks between government troops and opposition forces.
""The hospital's main warehouse was destroyed during the attack, and we lost most of our critical supplies for providing medical care,"" the group added.
It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack but MSF said: ""The government of South Sudan armed forces are the only armed party with the capacity to perform aerial attacks in the country.""
MSF said it was the only health provider serving around 250,000 people in Lankien and Pieri, warning that attacks on its facilities there ""mean that local communities will be left without any healthcare"".
""While we are aware of the enormous needs in the country, we find it unacceptable to be a target for attacks,"" said Gul Badshah, MSF's operations manager.
The medical charity said it had experienced eight targeted attacks in South Sudan last year, forcing the closure of two hospitals in Greater Upper Nile and the suspension of general healthcare activities in Jonglei, Upper Nile and Central Equatoria states.
In December, the South Sudanese government imposed restrictions on humanitarian access in opposition-held areas of Jonglei, limiting MSF's ability to deliver essential medical assistance.
Fighting between forces loyal to Machar and Kiir first broke out in 2013, two years after independence.
A 2018 peace deal ended the civil war that had killed nearly 400,000 people, but it has never been properly implemented and the relationship between the pair has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.
Machar is currently on trial on charges of murder, treason and crimes against humanity, which he denies.

Zimbabwe's Mugabe latest former African leader to be mentioned in Epstein files,2026-02-04T19:57:16.292Z," Shingai Nyoka
Harare
","Zimbabwe's ex-President Robert Mugabe may have had financial ties with Jeffrey Epstein, according to the latest batch of files related to the convicted US sex offender.
In an email exchange from 2015 with Japanese entrepreneur Joi Ito, the disgraced financier suggested they approach then-President Mugabe to provide Zimbabwe with a new currency after the local dollar collapsed because of hyperinflation.
FBI documents from 2017 also released had unverified testimony from a ""human confidential source"", who claimed Epstein was a wealth manager for Russia's President Vladimir Putin and provided the same service for Mugabe.
Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.
The BBC has asked the Mugabe family for a response.
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's independence leader and long-time president, died in September 2019 aged 95 - two years after being ousted in a coup.
Epstein, a well-connected US financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead in prison by suicide while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in August 2019.
He had been convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl in Florida and completed his sentence in July 2010.
The latest tranche of files released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) show the email correspondence between Joichi ""Joi"" Ito and Epstein that took place five years later.
In response to the email about providing Zimbabwe with a new currency, with the subject ""fertile land for exploration"", Ito, whose email address is redacted, asked if Epstein was friends with Mugabe, to which he replied: ""No, but can easily get his attention, zimbabwe would be a great petrie dish, its also supposed to be beautiful.""
Ito resigned in September 2019 as head of MIT's Media Lab over donations the academic centre had received from Epstein.
The BBC has contacted the FBI for more information about the documents contained in the recent release of Epstein files - as the US financier would have been violating sanctions had he been Mugabe's wealth manager.
Mugabe was put under US sanctions from 2003 - and US companies and citizens were prohibited from trading or conducting financial transactions with him.
Zimbabwe and Mugabe come up in other correspondence in the Epstein files.
An email written in April 2012 suggested incorrectly that Mugabe was on his death bed in Italy.
The sender's full name and email are redacted but the message is signed off as ""jonathan"". He asks Epstein for possible contacts in the country, adding ""they have some great companies if this guy is really done whi=h he is"".
Mugabe was then 88 years old - and appeared fit and well days later on his return from Singapore to lead independence celebrations.
One of his old allies, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that such inaccuracies suggested the information on Mugabe was fabricated.
Zimbabwe is still governed by Mugabe's Zanu-PF party - and struggled with inflation for decades following the abandonment of the Zimbabwean dollar in 2009.
Several attempts to introduce a new currency failed, but a gold-backed currency called the Zig, launched two years ago, has managed to stabilise the economy after a shaky start - though many people still rely on the US dollar.

Leader of South Africa's second largest party to step down,2026-02-04T13:47:03.450Z," Khanyisile Ngcobo
Johannesburg
","South Africa's Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen has said he will not seek re-election as the party's leader in April - a move that may threaten the stability of the coalition government.
The DA, South Africa's second largest party, entered into a coalition with its arch rival the African National Congress in 2024 after the ANC lost its parliamentary majority.
Steenhuisen took over leadership of the pro-business DA in 2019 and currently serves as agriculture minister in President Cyril Ramaphosa's government.
The 49-year-old was widely expected to run again but was reportedly forced to abandon his bid because of several controversies.
""For the rest of this term of office, I will focus all of my time and energy as minister of agriculture on defeating the most devastating foot-and-mouth disease outbreak our country has ever seen,"" he told a press conference.
Steenhuisen began his political career aged 22 when he was elected to the council of the the port city of Durban for the Democratic Party, the DA's predecessor.
He rose up through the party's local and then regional leadership before becoming leader of the party, which traditionally has a white support base, two decades later.
It was widely reported that Steenhuisen would run unopposed for the leadership at the DA's upcoming conference.
But it seems a variety of issues led to his decision not to do so, including his fallout with another senior DA member, ex-Environment Affairs Minister Dion George, and allegations, of which he was cleared in January, that he had abused his party credit card.
He has also been criticised for his handling of the foot-and-mouth outbreak, with farmers accusing his department of being an ""obstacle in a crisis"", according to South Africa's News24 website.
The country has struggled over the past four years to contain the highly infectious virus that has now spread to most the country's provinces - badly affecting the livestock industry.
It causes blisters inside an animal's mouth and under their hooves, which can cause lameness and problems feeding. In dairy cattle, milk yields will be lost and the cattle's value will be permanently reduced.
Under Steenhuisen, the DA party agreed to join the ANC as its biggest partner in the government of national unity nearly two years ago.
It was an historic moment for the country as the ANC, the party that brought in democratic rule in 1994 with Nelson Mandela and ended white-minority rule, had lost its parliamentary majority.
As expected it has been a fractious political marriage, but despite some differences they have stayed together - and Steenhuisen and Ramaphosa have shown how the partnership can work.
This was best exemplified when they supported each other in the Oval Office showdown with US President Donald Trump in May last year.
After Trump confronted the delegation with a video in support of discredited claims of a white genocide in South Africa, it was Steenhuisen who assured the US president that the majority of white farmers wanted to stay in the country.
Their performance proved to South Africans that the government of national unity was worth the bickering at home.
No DA leaders have announced their candidacies for the top post yet, but Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis has been touted as a possible successor.
Steenhuisen and Hill-Lewis are close and the latter has repeatedly said he would not run against his friend, according to the TimesLive news site.

Libyan prosecutors launch probe into killing of Gaddafi's son,2026-02-04T12:40:06.489Z," Nick Springate
Maia DaviesandWycliffe Muia
","Libyan prosecutors say they are investigating the killing of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the country's long-time leader Col Muammar Gaddafi.
The 53-year-old, who was once widely seen as his father's heir apparent, was killed during a ""direct confrontation"" with four unknown gunmen who broke into his home in the city of Zintan, his office said in a statement.
""The victim died from wounds by gunfire,"" Libyan prosecutors said on Wednesday, adding that efforts were under way to identify the gunmen.
In a different version of events, his sister told Libyan TV that he had died near the country's border with Algeria.
Saif al-Islam's lawyer told the AFP news agency a ""four-man commando"" unit carried out an assassination at his home in the city of Zintan, though it was not clear who may have been behind the attack.
The public prosecutor's office said forensic experts had been dispatched to Zintan in north-west Libya to conduct investigations.
Saif al-Islam was long seen as the most influential and feared figure in the country after his father, who ruled Libya from 1969 until being ousted and killed during an uprising in 2011.
BBC World Affairs editor John Simpson, who had met Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, said that he was ""a strange, mercurial figure, but he was much less eccentric than his father"".
""During the 2011 revolution, he agreed to be interviewed for the BBC, only to scream insults at me in front of his officials,"" Simpson said.
""Then he sent them away, and apologised profusely. 'They expect it of me,' he said.""
According to Libyan journalist and writer Abdulkader Assad, Saif al-Islam might have been targeted by locals who felt their political influence was being threatened by his popularity.
""It could also be foreign actors took him out because of his controversial past,"" Abdulkader told the BBC's Newsday programme.
Born in 1972, he played a key role in Libya's rapprochement with the West from 2000 until the collapse of the Gaddafi regime.
After his father's removal, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi - who was accused of playing a key role in the brutal repression of anti-government protests - was jailed by a rival militia in the city of Zintan for almost six years.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) wanted to put him on trial for crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the suppression of opposition protests in 2011.
In 2015, he was given a death sentence in absentia for his role in the crackdown by a court in Tripoli, in the west of the country, where control is in the hands of the UN-backed government.
But he was released by militia in Tobruk, in the east, under an amnesty law two years later.
Simpson attended his trial in Zintan.
""In the courtroom he greeted me and my television crew with relief, maybe thinking that our presence would save him from execution,"" he said.
""But he had great faith in his negotiating skills and his personal charm, and he managed to win over his captors, who eventually freed him.
""But the loathing many Libyans felt for his father extended to him, and may have brought about his death.""
Since the overthrow of Gaddafi, Libya has been split into areas controlled by various militias and is currently divided between two rival governments.
During his father's time as leader, he shaped policy and led high-profile negotiations despite having no official role in government, including those which led his father to abandon his nuclear weapons programme.
Such agreements saw international sanctions on the north African country lifted, and some considered Gaddafi a reformist and acceptable face of a changing Libya.
Gaddafi had always denied that he wanted to inherit power from his father, saying the reins of power were ""not a farm to inherit"".
However, in 2021 he announced he would run for the presidency in elections which were then postponed indefinitely.

'Notorious Tanzanian drug trafficker' arrested during raid in Zambia,2026-02-04T11:48:46.633Z," Wycliffe Muia
","A ""notorious"" Tanzanian drug-trafficking kingpin has been arrested in Zambia during a raid, the Zambian Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) has announced.
Ahmed Muharram was among several suspects detained in Zambia's capital, Lusaka, along with large quantities of marijuana and cough syrup containing codeine in several drug busts on Tuesday, the authorities said.
""The suspect is a known transnational drug trafficker,"" the DEC said, adding that the 40-year-old had long been on the anti-drug agency's watch-list.
The arrest of Muharram, who has not yet commented, was made possible thanks to a series of intelligence-led operations, the agency said.
Under Zambian law, marijuana is classed as a dangerous drug and is illegal to possess.
The trafficking, possession and use of illegal drugs such as cannabis is punishable by a fine or a prison sentence.
The southern Africa country struggles with drug abuse and trafficking, especially cannabis and heroin.
During Tuesday's operations, the DEC said it had seized 221.2kg of cannabis hidden in a lorry in Lusaka's Lilayi area.
The search was extended to Muharram's residence in Lilayi, where officers discovered an additional 1,159.6kg of ""high-grade"" cannabis, bringing the total seizure to 1,380.8kg, the agency added.
A Zambian national who was also arrested is believed to be an accomplice in the organised drug-trafficking scheme.
The DEC said their operations also saw the arrests of:
A Zambian national for trafficking 55 boxes of Benylin containing codeine in Lusaka
Two other Zambians for trafficking cannabis concealed in their vehicle
Two Burundian nationals in the southern district of Chirundu for trafficking cannabis in separate vehicles: some was hidden inside a spare lorry tyre, some in gas compressors and additional cannabis was mixed with sugar, salt and paint and concealed in tins and buckets of paint.
""All suspects have since been detained in lawful custody and will appear in court soon,"" DEC said in a statement.
The agency said it was committed to ensuring that Zambia was neither used as a corridor nor a destination for drug trafficking.

Why a beauty spot in South Africa could be about to run out of water,2026-02-04T00:41:49.668Z," Pumza Fihlani
Knysna
","Fears that the taps in the South African tourist resort of Knysna, with its turquoise water, sandy beaches and pleasant weather, could soon run dry - a moment known as ""day zero"" - have prompted a state of disaster to be declared.
It is a scary prospect for the 100,000 residents who live in an area situated along South Africa's famous Garden Route, a 150km (93-mile) stretch of seaside towns with forested and mountainous scenery on the southern coast.
But it is the latest South African town to be hit by a severe water crisis, caused by the failure to maintain infrastructure and changing weather patterns.
Beneath the pretty veneer of Knysna - which is also a retirement haven for more affluent South Africans - its water system is on the brink of collapse.
Official estimates suggest that around 55% of the town's drinkable water is lost to leaking pipes.
It is a problem compounded by the fact that the town has been hit by a drought, leading to a sharp drop in water levels at its main storage dam.
When we visited the area last week, Akkerkloof dam had just 20 days' worth of reserves.
But it is not clear when exactly ""day zero"" will hit as the authorities have stepped in with water restrictions and emergency funding.
A retirement centre in Knysna has already experienced its version of ""day zero"" - when a fault at a local municipal plant left the elderly residents without any water for 10 days last October.
This prompted owner, Franco de Grandis, to invest in a back-up water supply for the facility.
""We need water in the apartments; we need water when people are bedridden in nappies. Without water, we cannot function,"" he told the BBC.
He has spent around 250,000 South African rand ($15,700; £11,400) on the new operation, which includes three 10,000-litre water storage tanks and specialised pressure pumps to feed that water into some of main buildings, whenever there are water outages.
""We had to make out own plan, I knew I couldn't allow our residents to experience something like that again,"" he said.
Non-governmental organisations like Gift of the Givers have also stepped in to throw a lifeline to residents who cannot afford back-up measures.
From privately dug boreholes, they bring thousands of litres of water in tankers almost daily to the town.
""There is serious gratitude from the people when we arrive,"" Gift of the Givers' local co-ordinator Mario Ferreira told the BBC.
""The disturbing thing is [that] the people start thinking this is the way of life and it shouldn't be,"" Ferreira added.
There are fears queuing for water rations will become a reality unless a solution is found.
""Water is a basic right. It's frustrating that the town has come to this,"" De Grandis said.
In office for 11 months, Mayor Thando Matika acknowledges the problems, but is quick to point out that he inherited them from his predecessors.
""The municipality has for years not been doing maintenance. They said there was no money. Even the boreholes dug in 2009 were not working anymore,"" he told the BBC.
His council has now received an emergency cash boost from the national government of $1.25m to deal with the crisis.
Plans include fixing the town's seven boreholes and desalination plant as well as drilling for an extra borehole in the short term.
Looking at how to recycle water and building another dam are part of its longer-term focus.
""Hydrologists are in town looking at that process,"" the mayor explained.
Water meters will be also be installed in homes where there are none or they have been broken.
Restrictions were put in place in January, including reducing the town's water pressure and people are banned from watering gardens, filling pools and washing boats with municipal water.
Water is rationed to 50 litres per person per day - to put that into perspective, the average person in the UK uses 142 litres a day, according to Water UK.
Though talk of the ""day zero"" has made those in the tourism business edgy.
""The name 'day zero' can inspire panic and seems threatening,"" said Elmay Bouwer, who heads the tourism section of the Great Knysna Business Council and also runs a bed and breakfast.
""We should instead tell people how to preserve the water we have. We tell the international tourists about the restrictions, but we also want to make sure they have a good time here.
""It's about respecting the resources, not scaring people.""
Yet experts say South Africa needs to be scared out of its complacency. Cape Town, South Africa's second-largest city, infamously came close to ""day zero"" in the drought of 2018.
""I definitely think we're going to see more and more reports of towns struggling with water security,"" Dr Ferial Adam of campaign group Watercan told the BBC.
""For some millions in South Africa, 'day zero' is every day, it exists now. Half of the population do not have running water in their homes,"" she said.
""That tells us there is an access issue, on top of that access issue you have infrastructure that's been allowed to go to ruin, as well as climate change changes across the country.
""You combine all those factors - and you get what we're sitting with which is a melting pot of problems.""
This is reflected in Khayalethu township, a short drive from the picturesque town of Knysna.
Irregular water supply there is a part of life, but the residents say the ""day-zero anxiety"" has at least brought attention to their daily struggle.
""You cannot live without water, but we're often left without it for days at a time,"" 60-year-old Khanyiswa Sewula tells the BBC.
""I'm an old woman, and struggle to walk… but I am forced to carry a bucket to where the municipal tankers park, if I want to have water in my home.""

South Sudan's leader sacks aides after dead man appointed,2026-02-03T17:40:19.535Z," Nichola Mandil
Juba
","South Sudan's President Salva Kiir has sacked two senior aides following an embarrassing situation where he appointed a dead man to serve on a panel to lead discussions on elections scheduled for December.
Steward Soroba Budia's appointment was announced in a presidential order dated 30 January, but local media pointed out that the member of the opposition United Democratic Party (UDP), had died five years ago.
It led to people mocking the appointment on social media.
Without giving reasons, an official statement said the president had sacked his press secretary David Amour Major and the chief administrator in the Ministry of Presidential Affairs, Valentino Dhel Maluet.
Kiir was ""pleased"" to announce that the two had been relieved of their duties, and wished to express his ""profound gratitude"" to them for their service, said the statement posted on the president's official Facebook account, and signed by Minister of Presidential Affairs Africano Mande Gedima.
On Monday, Amour said in a press release that the president's office had relied entirely on the ""accuracy and currency"" of the names submitted by ""stakeholders"" for inclusion on the panel.
""It is now evident that a thorough verification was not done by one of the stakeholders which resulted in this unfortunate administrative oversight,"" Amour said.
He did not name the stakeholder, while the UDP has not commented.
It is unclear whether the statement led to Amour's dismissal. There had been speculation before the statement that he would be sacked.
Budia had been a signatory to a peace agreement signed in 2018 to end conflict that had hit South Sudan after its independence in 2011.
Kiir has set up the panel, made up of representatives of different parties, to pave the way for elections.
But there are doubts as to whether the election will take place, as the country is still experiencing conflict.
Previous elections have been postponed, with Kiir in office since independence.
The UN says more than 180,000 people are believed to have been forced to flee their homes by recent fighting.
Jonglei state is seeing the worst of it with the army battling forces aligned to South Sudan's suspended Vice-President Riek Machar.
He is currently under house arrest and on trial for murder, treason and crime against humanity. He denies the charges.
Kiir and Machar are supposed to be part of a unity government agreed in the 2018 settlement after a five-year war that followed a power struggle between the two men.

Ethiopia PM hits out at Eritrea over atrocities in Tigray,2026-02-03T14:39:30.387Z," Michael Teferi
BBC Africa
","Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has hit out at Eritrea's army for committing atrocities during the two-year war in the northern Tigray region, which ended in 2022.
Eritrean forces fought alongside the Ethiopian army against local Tigrayan fighters for control of Tigray, which borders Eritrea.
In an address to parliament, Abiy admitted for the first time that Eritrean troops had massacred people in Aksum - allegations Eritrea had previously denied following reports of mass killings that took place in the historic city over two days in November 2020.
It is the latest twist in a volatile relationship between the two Horn of Africa neighbours, who flip flop from being friends to enemies.
Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for ending a 20-year military stalemate with Eritrea over a border dispute.
Friendly relations were forged further during the Tigray war, but have of late given way to a war of words over the Red Sea - something landlocked Ethiopia wants access to through Eritrea.
Ethiopia's foreign ministry has also recently accused Eritrea of changing allegiances in Tigray - leading to fears of a renewed conflict in the region.
The African Union (AU) brokered a deal between the government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) to end the brutal Tigray war in November 2022, but Eritrea was not a signatory to the Pretoria Agreement.
At the time Asmara opposed the truce, arguing it should not have been concluded before the TPLF was fully defeated.
All sides were accused of committing atrocities during the Tigray war - with some of the worst abuses blamed on Eritrean troops.
Most communications to the region were cut off during the war - and journalists were not granted access, but the BBC and rights groups like Amnesty International were able to piece together what happened in Aksum.
Witnesses recounted how hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed by Eritrean soldiers - many of them boys and men - during house-to-house raids on 28 and 29 November 2020.
Abiy had told parliament on 30 November 2020 that ""not a single civilian was killed"" during the operation.
But during his parliamentary address on Tuesday the prime minister admitted that there had been mass killings of young people by Eritrean soldiers.
He added that during the war when allied forces began taking control of Tigray's cities, Eritrean troops had demolished homes, looted properties, destroyed industries and seized machinery in places such as Adwa, Aksum, Adigrat and Shire.
Abiy said he had dispatched envoys to Eritrea during the conflict, urging its government to halt the destruction and killings.
His comments came as passenger flights between Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, and cities in Tigray resumed on Tuesday morning after a five-day suspension.
They had been cancelled because of clashes between the federal army and Tigray fighters in a disputed area of western Tigray - sparking fears of a return to conflict.
An AU envoy estimated that 600,000 people were killed during the two-year Tigray war.

Somali woman executed for murdering a child in a case that sparked outrage,2026-02-03T14:09:19.392Z," Fardowsa Hanshi
BBC Somali
","The authorities in Puntland, a semi‑autonomous region of Somalia, have executed a woman convicted of murdering a 14‑year‑old girl, in a rare case in the region in which the death penalty has been carried out against a woman.
Hodan Mohamud Diiriye, 34, was killed by firing squad on Tuesday in the city of Galkayo after a court found her guilty of beating to death a teenager who had been working as a domestic helper.
Saabirin Saylaan's killing in November sparked protests in Galkayo, along with renewed calls for greater child protection.
The case touched a deep nerve in a country where child abuse often goes unreported, especially when it occurs inside extended families.
Officials said the sentence was carried out under ""qisas"", an Islamic legal principle that allows the family of a murder victim to demand execution rather than accept financial compensation.
A decree in the Mudug region, where the murder happened, requires Islamic law to be enforced in such cases.
Members of both Saabirin's family and Diiriye's family were present when the sentence was carried out, according to Faysal Sheikh Ali, Mudug's governor.
The Puntland authorities said this was the first time in more than 10 years that a woman had been executed there under a retaliatory sentence.
The last known execution of a woman occurred in 2013, when 13 members of the Islamist militant group al‑Shabab, including one woman, were executed by firing squad for their involvement in the killing of a prominent Islamic scholar, the authorities said at the time.
Diiriye's victim was orphaned when both her parents died within a short period when she was a one year old.
She was initially looked after by her family but then last year Saabirin's great-aunt agreed that Diiriye's family, who needed a home help, could take her in.
During their investigation, police revealed that in the two months she had been living there, the young girl had endured ""routine physical abuse"" - she was beaten and tortured.
Evidence recovered from Diiriye's phone, including videos and audio recordings, documented repeated violence. Some of these were leaked to the public before the trial - it is not clear who released them.
In one particularly disturbing recording, Diiriye can be heard saying: ""I'm enjoying your pain.""
A post-mortem examination of Saabirin's body revealed multiple injuries and deep stab wounds consistent with prolonged violence.
As details of the police investigation emerged, public anger grew.
Hundreds of women and young people marched in Galkayo, one of Puntland's largest cities, carrying signs reading ""Justice for Saabirin"" and calling on the authorities to prosecute all those responsible.
In the wake of the case, activists, elders and community leaders have called for accountability and stronger protections for children and domestic workers, who are often vulnerable to abuse.

South Africa's ex-President Zuma mentioned in Epstein emails over London dinner plan,2026-02-03T12:25:24.628Z," Ed Habershon
Johannesburg
","Former South African President Jacob Zuma has been mentioned in the latest tranche of the Epstein files, after his name appeared in several emails from the late sex offender and others.
They concerned a dinner Jeffrey Epstein seemingly arranged for Zuma in London in 2010, which the emails suggest was also attended by a ""beautiful"" Russian model.
Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.
The Jacob Zuma Foundation has described stories about the emails as ""agenda-driven journalism built on innuendo"" and ""guilt by association"", adding that there was no ""unlawful or improper conduct"" by the former president.
The email chain about the dinner contained in the Epstein files is as follows.
An email from 4 March 2010, from someone arranging the dinner to a possible guest and copying in Epstein, says:
""I am a friend of Jeffrey Epstein and I have been asked to help arrange a small dinner tomorrow night for President Jacob Zuma of South Africa at the Ritz Hotel at 7:00pm tomorrow evening.
""Jeffrey suggested that I invite you, as you would be certain to add some real glamour to the occasion. A friend of Jeffrey's is a friend of mine, so I have no hesitation inviting you to join us.
""If you are not put off by the extremely short notice and would be able to accept, can you let me have a little more information about yourself as well as your full name (as I have to present the President with a summary of the guests in advance).""
The person then responded - also copying in Epstein - saying:
""It is very kind of you and Jeffrey to invite me and I will be honored to accept your invitation. About myself: my name is (redacted). I'm from Russia and I have lived in London for the past 2 years. I am a model, represented by Select model agency. I have been modeling for the past 6 years and have lived in Paris, New York, Barcelona and Japan. Please let me know if you need any other information.
""Will it be a black tie event or is a sleeveless cocktail dress ok?""
In a separate email about the dinner, Epstein contacted British politician Lord Peter Mandelson, saying the host ""is having dinner for zuma tomorrow night at the ritz„ i have invited a beautiful russina named (redacted) to attend"".
A response from Lord Mandelson is not recorded.
On 6 March, Epstein sent an email to an unknown person and received a reply the next day:
“Jeffrey, (name redacted) was a delight last night and enchanted all those she met. Her beauty apart, she displayed an elegance and natural charm that is a rare combination to find anywhere these days. So a very big thank you for the introduction.... By the way, Jacob Zuma was much more impressive and engaging than I thought he would be!""
The BBC contacted the Jacob Zuma Foundation for comment, and was referred to a statement issued to South African media outlet Daily Maverick.
This said: ""The so-called 'revelation' published by Daily Maverick is a textbook example of agenda-driven journalism built on innuendo, third-party emails and retrospective guilt by association.
""At no point does the article allege, let alone establish, any unlawful or improper conduct by Jacob Zuma.
""The attempt to smear President Zuma by proximity to the unrelated crimes of a third party is unethical, irresponsible and intellectually dishonest.
""The Jacob Zuma Foundation will not participate in speculative narrative-building disguised as investigative journalism. The matter is closed.""
Zuma was on a state visit to the UK visited the UK from 3-5 March 2010.
Epstein, a well-connected US financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead in prison by suicide in 2019 while awaiting a trial on sex trafficking charges.

"Banknote bouquets could land you in jail, Kenya's central bank warns",2026-02-03T09:28:35.765Z," Basillioh Rukanga
Nairobi
","Kenya's central bank has warned people to stop using banknotes to make floral-like bouquets and decorations, which has become a trend in the East African nation.
They are often ordered in the run-up to Valentine's Day - and have been popularised by celebrities and online influencers, who share videos of themselves presenting such bouquets during celebrations.
To make the cash bouquets, notes of different colours and value are rolled and then fastened together in a style that makes them look like a bunch of flowers.
But the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) says the creators are defacing the Kenyan currency and could face seven years in jail if arrested.
According to the CBK, the banknotes tend to be ""folded, rolled, glued, stapled, pinned or otherwise affixed using adhesives or fastening materials... compromising their integrity"".
This was affecting equipment such as automated teller machines (ATMs) and cash-counting machines, the CBK said in its statement issued on Monday.
The cash bouquets had also led to more notes being rejected and unnecessary costs for both the public and the bank to replace the currency, it added.
However, the bank said it was not opposed to cash being used as gifts, and asked people to find alternative ways of doing so that did not damage the banknotes.
Kenya is a top global grower of flowers - so the announcement has been welcomed by some who say fresh blooms would be a more appropriate gift for Valentine's Day on 14 February.
It has also drawn some amused reactions on social media.
""The public notice from the Central Bank of Kenya has saved men ahead of this year's Valentine's Day. Back to basics, bouquet of flowers it is,"" Alinur Mohamed says on X.
Another Kenyan says the ""public has hailed this decision"" as it provides ""a much-needed relief for those who found such cash bouquets overly expensive and wasteful"".

Shanties in a Lagos lagoon: Bulldozed and burnt,2026-02-03T00:13:23.636Z," Chiamaka Dike
BBC Africa
Makoko
Lagos
","A mother of five, Anna Sobie's wooden home is one of many that has been demolished in a shanty town in a lagoon in Lagos, with critics describing it as a ""land-grab"" by the authorities to gentrify the prime waterfront spot in Nigeria's biggest city.
Lagos State government officials deny the allegation, saying they are demolishing parts of Makoko - the country's biggest informal waterfront settlement - because it is expanding near high voltage power lines, posing a major health and safety risk.
Sobie and her children now sleep on the narrow broken platform where their house stood until a few weeks ago on Lagos Lagoon. This is the biggest of 10 lagoons in a mega-city that is facing an acute housing crisis - and where life is becoming increasingly expensive, pushing more people to the margins of society.
As Sobie spoke to the BBC, canoes - steered with paddles or long bamboo poles - moved through the narrow waterways, carrying mattresses and sacks of clothes belonging to the displaced people.
Residents say the demolitions began two days before Christmas, when excavation teams accompanied by armed police moved into sections of the waterfront settlement facing the Atlantic Ocean.
In a joint statement last month, 10 non-governmental organisations said that ""armed thugs, security personnel and demolition teams with bulldozers descended repeatedly on the community"" to tear down homes, and burn them.
""Homes were set on fire with little or no notice, in some cases while residents were still [inside],"" the NGOs added.
When the BBC visited Makoko, smoke, from the rubble of torched homes or from fires that people had lit, burning damp wood to dry their clothes, was hanging in the air.
Excavators were at work along the shoreline - houses built on wooden stilts over the lagoon were still being pulled down, their planks collapsing into the water below. Corrugated metal sheets were falling from roofs and drifting between boats.
Makoko was founded in the 19th Century by fishing communities who have lived in the settlement ever since, along with other low-income families and migrants who come to Lagos in search of better opportunities.
Ownership of the lagoon is fiercely contested. The state government claims ownership of it under federal law, saying Makoko has been built without planning permission or occupancy rights.
Older residents dispute this, saying the settlement predates modern Lagos, and they have what they call a customary right to it.
Estimates of Makoko's population vary, from 80,000 to 200,000, but much of the settlement now lies in fragments.
The NGOs said that more than 10,000 people have been displaced after the destruction of more than 3,000 homes, as well as schools, clinics and churches. The state government has not given any figures of the buildings demolished.
Sobie's home was among those that have been destroyed.
""I was inside when it started,"" she says. ""The noise was very loud. When we came out, we saw the excavator.""
She says there was little time to move her family's belongings.
Her son Solomon's school in Makoko was demolished the same day.
Sobie's family moved briefly into a building nearby. That, too, was later pulled down.
""We're sleeping in an open space under the rain, and they're currently setting properties ablaze,"" Sobie says, adding: ""We don't have another place.""
Like many other children, Solomon no longer goes to school. He now helps his mother gather firewood from collapsed houses, pulling loose planks from the debris to sell.
Even as the excavators work, canoe-borne business activities continue, with traders peddling their way through the remaining homes to sell fish and goods.
But many other traders can no longer do business, as they lost their goods when their homes were demolished or torched.
With the lagoon central to their lives, they have protested against the move to force them out of Makoko.
More than 1,000 angry residents marched last week to the state legislature, the House of Assembly, demanding an audience with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, whose offices are nearby.
But police responded by firing tear gas, with protesters saying that at least one person was injured in the ensuing chaos.
Community leaders and residents say that tear gas was also fired during the demolitions a few weeks ago, causing the death of five people, including children.
""Children were weeping, some died, some were unconscious, and were taken to the hospital as a result of the tear gas,"" Sobie tells the BBC.
The Lagos State government says it is unaware of their personnel using tear gas or of deaths linked to the demolitions.
Speaking to the BBC, the state's commissioner for information, Gbenga Omotoso, says that any such claims would be investigated.
""We would determine the actual cause of death,"" he says. ""Our personnel will not knowingly kill anybody.""
Lagos lawmakers said that community leaders have been invited to a meeting on Tuesday to discuss their concerns.
The state government has defended the demolitions, saying they are targeting homes built beneath high voltage power lines.
""No responsible government anywhere in the world can allow people to live directly under high-tension cables or obstruct vital waterways,"" the governor's special adviser on urban development, Olajide Abiodun Babatunde, said in a statement.
Governor Sanwo-Olu said that affected families would be provided with financial grants and other assistance, and it was wrong to accuse him of ""destroying"" Makoko.
He raised concern that shanties were ""sprawling"" at an ""incredible speed"", getting closer to the Third Mainland Bridge, the longest and busiest of three bridges connecting the mainland to the islands - the commercial heart of the city and its wealthier neighbourhoods.
For the governor this spells danger.
""There are high-tension power lines right underneath there. I am not going to sit down, and something will drop off, and in one day, over 100 to 500 people will die,"" he was quoted by local media as saying.
""So, what we have done is that we just pushed them back,"" he added.
Lagos-based real estate developer Peacemaker Afolabi tells the BBC that demand for land in the city is huge.
""Everywhere in Lagos is prime land,"" he says. ""And waterfront is always prime.""
Some residents suspect that the demolitions are aimed at clearing the area for private developments, including luxury homes.
This has been repeatedly denied by the state government, but suspicion remains.
In an article published in the US-based Atlanta Tribune, Nigerian journalist Emmanuel Abara Benson argues that Makoko stands as the ""most painful symbol"" of the gentrification of Lagos.
""This is not the slow, decades-long gentrification often seen in Western cities. It's a rapid, almost violent reshaping that is already forcing millions of residents to the margins,"" he writes.
""In the next few years, Lagos may look more polished and globally appealing. But for many of its people, it will also become profoundly unliveable.""
In their joint statement, the NGOs said that demolitions in Makoko, and other settlements last year, were part of a ""sinister agenda to grab land"".
""These actions against thousands of peaceful, hardworking residents represent a deliberate pattern of state-enabled violence against the urban poor, carried out to clear valuable land for elite interests and private mega-developments,"" the NGOs said.
An official report released last year showed that while the city's ""housing supply improved significantly from 1.4 million units in 2016 to over 2.57 million units in 2025, it has not kept pace with demand"".
""The housing deficit has thus grown from approximately 2.95 million units in 2016 to 3.4 million in 2025, a 15 per cent increase,"" Nigeria's Punch newspaper quoted the report as saying.
Rapid population growth, rising rents and limited access to formal housing have pushed many low-income residents into informal settlements, particularly along waterfronts and transport corridors.
The authorities have demolished homes in Makoko in the past - most recently in 2017, when residents obtained a court order to prevent forced evictions without adequate notice, compensation and resettlement.
Megan Chapman, co-director of the Justice and Empowerment Initiatives campaign group, says the government has failed to provide residents affected by the latest demolitions with alternative accommodation.
""They have to identify everyone who will be affected and make arrangements before homes are lost,"" she tells the BBC
""When people are removed like this, it affects livelihoods, family structures and how communities function over time.""
When the BBC was in Makoko, boys were sitting along the lagoon, repairing their broken fishing nets. Children moved between piles of debris, collecting firewood from collapsed structures.
A tractor pulled away from what was once a house. Only a small number of buildings remained standing, including the homes of traditional leaders.
Elizabeth Kakisiwe says she sleeps nearby.
Each evening, she lays wooden boards on damp ground for her children and packs them away again in the morning.
""We were at the market when it started,"" she says. ""When I came back, my house was gone.""
She says there was no clear warning and no time to remove belongings. Clothes, cooking utensils and mattresses were lost. When rain fell days later, they were drenched.
""At night, we sit in the cold,"" she says. ""If the children feel sick, we give them paracetamol.""
Cooking has become difficult, she says, because rain has made the ground wet and rats move through the debris.
""Yesterday, we only drank garri,"" Kakisiwe says, referring to a popular cassava-based meal that is often made as a drink. ""There is nothing to cook.""
Expressing a similar view, Sobie says: ""The suffering is much. A lot of people have been dying. We just don't know what to say. It's only God that can help us.""

Ghana suspends citizenship process for people of African descent,2026-02-02T18:21:04.629Z," Thomas Naadi
BBC Africa
AccraandJean Otalor
","Ghana has paused citizenship applications for members of the African diaspora in order to make the system more accessible and user friendly.
Since 2016, those who can prove their ancestors came from Africa have been able to get Ghanaian nationality. It was primarily aimed at the descendants of those who were victims of the transatlantic slave trade.
More than 1,000 people - including African American singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder - have obtained Ghanaian citizenship in recent years.
However, some applicants have complained about the number of stages involved, as well as the high cost.
Dr Erieka Bennet, ambassador for the Diaspora African Forum, which helps people relocate to Ghana, told the BBC that many applicants struggled with the requirement to submit DNA evidence within a week of the application, saying the timeframe was ""impossible"" for most and that some also questioned the reliability of DNA testing.
She said the one-week deadline for submitting all additional documentation was difficult to meet.
Another concern was cost. The application fee stands at $136 (£100), while shortlisted candidates are required to pay a further $2,280 (£1,700).
They are then vetted and attend a one-day citizenship orientation before finally receiving their nationality at a ceremony overseen by President John Mahama.

Bennet expressed confidence that the issues would be resolved and that the application process would resume.
The government has said updated timelines and guidelines will be issued ""in due course"", without giving a timeframe.
Uncertainty around the suspension has caused anxiety for some potential applicants planning their relocation or investments.
Ghana's outreach to Africans worldwide is rooted in its post-independence Pan-African vision championed by the country's first President, Kwame Nkrumah.
It was relaunched in 2019 as the Year of Return to revive global interest in reconnecting with the country.
Today, members of the diaspora invest in sectors including real estate, agriculture, tech and small businesses, often seeking Ghanaian citizenship so they can own property, vote and access public services.
Countries such as Benin and Sierra Leone also offer citizenship to people of African descent based on verified ancestral ties.

South African singer Tyla edges out Davido to clinch Grammy,2026-02-02T14:23:29.868Z," Khanyisile Ngcobo
Johannesburg
","South African singer Tyla has won her second Grammy, beating four others, including three Nigerian artists, to take the Best African Music Performance award.
The 24-year-old won for her song Push 2 Start, which was preferred over tracks by Ayra Starr, Burna Boy and Davido, as well as Ugandan singer Eddy Kenzo.
Tyla bagged the same prize in 2024 for her global hit Water, also beating a host of Nigerian stars.
Reacting to her win after the awards ceremony in Los Angeles, she exclaimed: ""This is insane, this is so insane! I'm just so lucky to be here and I'm so proud to be African. I'm excited to see more of us over here.""
""Congratulations Tyla"" has been trending on social media in South Africa and elsewhere.
""South Africa is proud of you ! We are proud of you!,"" one X user posted.
Another said that while they had wished that Starr had won, they conceded that Tyla had worked hard: ""You deserve it.""
List of nominees in Best African Music Performance category:
Love - Burna Boy
With You - Davido featuring Omah Lay
Hope & Love - Eddy Kenzo & Mehran Matin
Gimme Dat - Ayra Starr featuring Wizkid
Push 2 Start - Tyla
There was disappointment among Nigerian music lovers after none of the country's stars won, despite the global success of Afrobeats.

Burna Boy was also nominated in the Best Global Music Album category, alongside Senegal's Youssou N'Dour, while Angelique Kidjo also got a nod in the Best Global Music Performance category.
None of them got to take home the famous gramophone player statuette.
One Nigerian star did get recognition: Fela Kuti was given a Lifetime Achievement Award 29 years after his death.
Another South African - comedian Trevor Noah - also had a big night, hosting the main ceremony for the sixth, and last time.
However, US President Donald Trump has threatened to sue the comedian after he joked about Trump and Jeffrey Epstein.

Family seeks answers as Kenyan fighting for Russia killed in Ukraine,2026-02-02T11:50:48.413Z," Basillioh Rukanga
Nairobi
","A Kenyan family is seeking answers and support to repatriate the body of their 29-year-old relative, who was killed in Ukraine while fighting for Russia.
Clinton Nyapara Mogesa, 29, initially left Kenya for a job in Qatar in 2024, but later told his relatives that he was travelling to Russia.
On Saturday, Ukrainian authorities reported that he had died in a so-called ""meat assault"" - one involving high casualty numbers - in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, after being recruited in Qatar. They said the Russians did not evacuate his body, and he was carrying the passports of two other Kenyans.
His death comes amid growing concerns about Kenyans being recruited to fight in the war in Ukraine.
Vincent Okemwa, Mogesa's cousin, said they did not believe it when they were informed of his death. He said the news was first relayed to Mogesa's brother by a colleague who had a relative in Russia, before it was made public.
He told the BBC Newsday programme that Mogesa had notified them when he moved to Russia from Qatar and they were in communication during his training there for three weeks.
They had however not heard from him after the training, and the last time they had spoken was on 28 October.
Okemwa told the BBC that after his death, Mogesa's family was now in a ""pathetic state"". He said Mogesa's father had sold land to facilitate his son's travel to Qatar and he was his family's hope for a better life.
""I don't know how I can put it, but things are not good,"" he said.
""He had good plans for the family and now everything has been shattered.""
Okemwa says the family has been in ""total darkness"" as they have not had any communication from the authorities in either Kenya or Russia.
""His death has shocked us,"" his brother Joel Mogere told local Citizen TV. He said Mogesa was the last-born and ""the breadwinner and the hope of this family"".
His mother, Mellen Moraa, said she was diabetic and that her son used to pay for her medication and take care of her, and said she did not know what to do.
""I plead with the government for help,"" she added.
The government last month said that 18 Kenyans who had been fighting in Russia had been rescued and repatriated.
Last week, rights group Vocal Africa said they were following up on at least 18 cases of Kenyans who were either dead or missing. They have asked the government to verify the figures, adding that the number was likely to be higher.
The Kenyan government has not confirmed the deaths of any of its nationals killed in Ukraine.
Last November, Kenya's foreign minister said about 200 Kenyans were known to be fighting for Russia and that recruitment networks were still active.
Other African countries have reported cases of young people being approached with offers of lucrative jobs in Russia that later led to military recruitment.
Ukraine's intelligence assessment estimates that more than 1,400 people from 36 countries in Africa have been recruited to fight for Russia.
Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.
In the past Ukraine has repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia would be treated as an enemy combatant, with the safe route out being to surrender.
Ukraine's intelligence agency on Saturday cautioned foreign nationals against travelling to Russia or accepting employment there, particularly informal or illegal work.
It said travelling there ""carries a real risk of being forcibly deployed to assault units without adequate training and with little to no chance of survival"".

Aspiring Nigerian singer dies after being bitten by a snake,2026-02-01T22:31:53.086Z," Makuochi Okafor
BBC Africa
Lagos
","There has been an outpouring of grief in Nigeria following the death of an aspiring singer who died on Saturday after being bitten by a snake in the capital, Abuja.
Ifunanya Nwangene, 26, rose to prominence after appearing on The Voice Nigeria, the local version of the international TV singing competition, in 2021. She was known for her versatility, blending jazz, opera, classical music and soul.
Videos shared on social media show a snake handler removing a snake from her apartment, as people nearby can be heard screaming: ""It is a cobra!""
A close friend, Sam Ezugwu, the co-founder and music director of the Amemuso Choir where she sang, told the BBC that Nwangene was a ""rising star"".
He said she had been planning to stage her first solo concert later this year. She was also a trained architect.
Hillary Obinna, another friend who sang alongside her, told the BBC he was told she had been asleep when ""the snake bite woke her up"".
He said that two snakes were later found in the house.
She first sought treatment at a nearby clinic but they did not have any antivenom so she went to a hospital.
Ezugwu said he rushed to the hospital on Saturday after learning that she had been taken there. He said the hospital had one of the required antivenoms but not the other.
""While they were trying to stabilise her, she could not speak but she could make hand gestures. She was struggling to breathe,"" he added.
Ezugwu said he drove out to search for the missing antivenom but returned to find that she had died.
He said the entire choir went to the hospital that evening, ""hoping that a miracle would happen"".
In a statement, the hospital denied that the venom had been unavailable and said claims its response had been inadequate were ""unfounded and do not reflect the reality of the situation"".
The Federal Medical Centre, Jabi said on Sunday: ""Our medical staff provided immediate and appropriate treatment, including resuscitation efforts, intravenous fluids, intranasal oxygen, and the administration of polyvalent snake antivenom.""
It said a ""thorough but quick"" assessment showed Nwangene had suffered severe complications from the bite. Her condition suddenly deteriorated prior to a transfer to intensive care, it added, and medics had been ""unable to revive her"".
""We stand by the quality of care and dedication our team demonstrates daily.""
Obinna described her friend as ""a very wonderful girl, she is humble – very intelligent and very talented"".
""Everybody is shattered. We could not sleep at night.""
Nwangene's death comes amid a renewed debate in Nigeria about the quality of healthcare and patient safety, following a series of allegations of medical negligence.
These include the recent death of novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 21-month-old son. The hospital in that case has denied any wrongdoing.
In response to the public outcry, Nigeria's health minister has acknowledged ""systemic challenges"" in the health system and announced the creation of a national task force on ""clinical governance and patient safety"".
Most snake bite victims in Nigeria are believed to live in rural areas and many Nigerians are shocked at Nwangene's death in an upmarket part of the capital.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says venomous snakebites are a neglected public health issue in many tropical and subtropical countries.
In Africa, between 435,000 and 580,000 snakebites requiring treatment are recorded each year, according to the WHO. The burden falls mainly on women, children and farmers in rural communities, where health systems are weakest and medical resources limited.
Those bites cause about 30,000 deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa, though some estimates suggest the real number is much higher.
Experts say the shortage of antivenom is a major reason the scale of the problem is hard to assess. It leads many bite victims to seek care from traditional healers, meaning cases often go unrecorded.
Even where antivenom is available, it is often too expensive, and storage is difficult because most antivenoms require refrigeration in areas with unreliable electricity.

More than 200 killed in mine collapse in DR Congo,2026-02-01T11:27:31.691Z," Paul Njie
","More than 200 people have been killed in a mine collapse in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, rebel authorities have said.
The mine, in the town of Rubaya, gave way on Wednesday due to heavy rains, Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesman for the North Kivu region's rebel governor, told reporters. At the time, the death toll remained unclear.
Women and children were among those mining coltan - a mineral used to manufacture electronics such as smartphones and computers - at the time.
A former supervisor of the mine told the BBC the site was not properly maintained, making accidents more likely and hampering rescue efforts when they occur.
He added that the fragile nature of the soil made the situation worse.
The Congolese authorities have blamed the deaths on the rebels, saying they were putting the lives of civilians at risk through allowing illegal mining without enforcing safety standards.
They said they had banned mining in the area last year, even though the rebels had already seized control of the mines by then.
There have been numerous similar mine collapses in DR Congo over the years, including in areas controlled by the government.
Women, children and artisanal miners - those not officially employed by a mining firm - are among those killed in the collapse. Around 20 survivors are said to be receiving treatment in hospital.
A source whose cousin died in the landslide expressed shock, saying it was ""a big loss"" for the family and community.
""I didn't believe he could pass away in such circumstances,"" the source, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC, describing his cousin as a ""courageous"" and ""ambitious"" man whose main goal was to provide for his wife and two children.
""I didn't believe [he was dead] because investigations were still ongoing. His body wasn't found after the accident, so I did have hope that he could be found alive. Unfortunately, some hours later, his body was discovered.""
Governor Erasto Bahati Musanga, who was appointed by M23 rebels after seizing swathes of territory in North Kivu, visited survivors of the incident on Friday.
Rubaya is one of a number of towns across North Kivu under the control of the M23, who international observers say are backed by neighbouring Rwanda, providing photos of Rwandan troops in the country. Rwanda has denied giving military support to the M23.
In its statement after the collapse, the Congolese government repeated its accusation that Rwanda was using the M23 to loot Congolese minerals.
""Mining activities carried out in this context of armed occupation constitute a structured system of looting and illegal exploitation of natural resources, part of an illicit supply chain of industrial scale,"" it said.
Although Rwanda has always denied the accusation, UN experts say there is evidence that minerals from DR Congo are being exported through Rwanda.
The mines in Rubaya hold about 15% of the world's coltan supply and half of the DR Congo's total deposits.
The metallic ore contains tantalum, which is used to produce high-performance capacitors in a range of electronic devices, making it in high demand worldwide.
When a BBC team visited the site in July 2025, they observed miners digging manually to source the precious mineral. Conditions at the site are very bad, with dangerous pits dotted around its vast expanse.
Since 2024, the M23 rebels have been in control of the mines. The UN has accused the group of imposing taxes on the mining sector for their own benefit.

The king's speech - and why it has foreigners in South Africa worried,2026-02-01T00:00:43.682Z," Khanyisile Ngcobo
Johannesburg
","South Africa's Zulu king has raised eyebrows by using a highly derogatory term for foreigners and saying they must all leave the country during a much-hyped speech that was supposed to have been aimed at calming anti-migrant feelings in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal.
Warning: This story contains language some people may find offensive
Misuzulu kaZwelithini was addressing his supporters at the place where 20,000 Zulus warriors defeated a British contingent of 1,800 soldiers 147 years ago beneath the rocky outcrop of Isandlwana hill.
The Battle of Isandlwana, fought during the Anglo-Zulu war, is something many Zulus wear like a badge of honour: they fought against a foreign army and won - the foreigners were cowed.
The ire of many of King Misuzulu's subjects is now directed not at British invaders but at migrants from neighbouring countries like Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe who have come to South Africa to work. According to official statistics, the country is home to about 2.4 million migrants, about 4% of the population.
The 51-year-old monarch did not advocate violence but said all ""kwerekwere"", an offensive word for African migrants, must pack their bags - even if they were in relationships with South Africans and had children with them.
""We must now sit down and discuss this because even if my nephew's father is a 'kwerekwere', the 'kwerekwere' must leave, only the child will remain,"" he said on Thursday to the delight of his audience - a response which prompted him to burst out laughing.
Many online have been quick to point out the irony of his remarks, considering the king's own mother was from Eswatini and one of his wives is also from the neighbouring kingdom.
But such xenophobic attitudes have long been an issue in South Africa, leading to deadly outbreaks of violence - and his comments echo those made by his late father Goodwill Zwelithini, who urged migrants in 2015 to ""pack their belongings"".
He later tried to back-pedal, claiming he was misquoted, but the country's human rights body found his comments ""hurtful and harmful"".
More than a decade on, xenophobia and anger directed at migrants remain a key political issue - with some believing foreigners are stealing jobs and benefiting from public services meant for South Africans.
The rate of unemployment in the country remains one of the highest in the world at around 33%.
This is something new opposition parties - like uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) led by former President Jacob Zuma, whose main support base is in KwaZulu-Natal - have latched on to with populist policies that support the expulsion of undocumented migrants.
This has led in recent years to the rise of vigilante anti-migrant groups, like Operation Dudula and March on March, which have gained notoriety for their demands that foreign nationals be removed from the country. ""Dudula"" means ""to remove something by force"" in the Zulu language.
Their latest campaign took place a few days before the king's speech and not long after the start of the academic year.
An angry group of protesters descended on a primary school in the KwaZulu-Natal port city of Durban, claiming that 90% of the pupils there were the children of migrants.
The heated demonstration forced the school to call parents to come and collect the students because of safety concerns - and the next day a large contingent of police was deployed to the gates of Addington Primary School.
The local authorities hit out at the organisers of the march, which was also supported by MK, and accused them of spreading misinformation.
""This has put a lot of people's lives at risk. It is a lie that 90% of learners are children of immigrants. The truth is that immigrants form 37% of the learner population,"" Mlu Mtshali, an education spokesperson for KwaZulu-Natal, told South Africa's Daily Maverick newspaper.
This prompted the education department to reveal that nationally, 253,618 foreign pupils are enrolled in South Africa's public schools - 1.8% of all students. Of these, 14,929 are at public schools in KwaZulu-Natal.
Commentators have also pointed out that in South Africa, all children have a legal right to basic education, irrespective of their nationality or status in the country.
Following the Addington Primary School protests and ahead of the Battle of Isandlwana commemoration, royal envoys hinted that King Misuzulu would address these concerns.
He has no formal political power, but a fifth of South Africa's population is Zulu and the monarchy remains hugely influential with a large budget funded by taxpayers.
The king also oversees a trust that owns and controls vast tracts of communal land in KwaZulu-Natal, which is supposed to be for the benefit local communities.
""We will speak to the 'kwerekweres' and tell them to leave. There is nobody who does not have a home to return to,"" the king said.
For Dr Vusumusi Sibanda, a human rights lawyer and expert on African diaspora issues, such words are ""unfortunate"" and ""worrying"" and encourage ordinary citizens to take the law into their own hands.
""The king is respected by [many people], including foreigners, and he's supposed to be that symbol,"" he told the BBC.
Lizette Lancaster, who works at South Africa's Institute for Security Studies think-tank, echoes this, telling me that the king's comments only served to ""fuel anti-migrant sentiment and should be strongly condemned"".
She also weighed in on the actions of vigilante groups, saying that while South African law protected activism, orchestrating vigilante activity ""including incitement or actions against migrants, must be identified and dealt with"".
The leader of March on March, Jacinta Ngobese Zuma, is now facing a public violence charge over the protests at Addington Primary School.
And in November, a court ordered Operation Dudula to stop blocking foreign nationals from accessing public health facilities and schools, saying it was illegal.
Another topic raised by the king that has the nation talking is his call to drop ""Natal"" from KwaZulu-Natal's name - again echoing a wish of his father.
""We need to remove this 'Natal'. This is KwaZulu, so I don't understand why we have this Natal,"" the king said.
Prior to 1994 and the end of South Africa's racist system of apartheid, the province now known as KwaZulu-Natal was split into two.
KwaZulu was classified as a ""homeland"", a semi-autonomous area reserved for ethnic Zulus, which existed within Natal province.
When South Africa ushered in democratic rule with Nelson Mandela elected president, the two were merged and the name conjoined.
Over the last three decades, many cities, towns and roads in South Africa have been renamed, replacing them with indigenous ones or calling them after heroes of the struggle against apartheid.
But for some commentators, the call to name the province simply KwaZulu is an unpalatable reminder of Zulu nationalism and its potential dangers.
In the years after Mandela's release from prison in 1990, political violence between his supporters and those of a Zulu nationalist party nearly derailed the process that led to the end of white-minority rule.
There are fears that renaming KwaZulu-Natal would create a kind of exceptionalism that could lead to more trouble in the ethnically diverse country which has 11 official languages.
Cultural expert Prof Musa Xulu is also quick to add that it would be wrong to regard KwaZulu-Natal as a Zulu province.
""In reality, it's a multicultural province,"" he told the BBC.
""[Re]naming it KwaZulu would be a distortion of history. There was never a time in history when this whole region… was a kingdom of the Zulus,"" he said.
Zulus ""don't have the powers to simply push people around and say that the province should be known as KwaZulu"", the academic added.
Until now King Misuzulu, on the throne since 2022, has mainly made the headlines with regard to the royal succession battle and his controversial divorce.
But now he seems to be following in his father's footsteps - and picking at scabs that never get a chance to heal in what is a politically charged environment.

This army chief threatened to castrate opposition leader and claimed descent from Jesus,2026-01-31T00:05:52.129Z," Basillioh Rukanga
","A fiery tweeter who is in charge of Uganda's military, Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba is decried by his critics as being in the middle of an unholy trinity, or alliance, of three men who rule the East African nation with an iron fist.
Kainerugaba, the son of the country's long-time leader Yoweri Museveni, has posted on social platform X about the killing of opposition supporters during this month's fiercely contested presidential election.
In posts which were subsequently deleted, he also threatened to have the testicles of defeated opposition candidate Bobi Wine removed.
With the 81-year-old president winning a seventh term, analysts say this is likely to be his last term and he is grooming his 51-year-son to succeed him.
The so-called ""unholy alliance"" - a play on the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity - is made up of Museveni, Kainerugaba, and the president's powerful brother and special adviser, Salim Saleh.
Kenya-based analyst for the Institute for Security Studies think-tank, Nicodemus Minde, tells the BBC that he heard the description during a recent research trip to Uganda.
""The Father being Museveni, then the Son being Muhoozi, then the Unholy Spirit could be the uncle, Salim Saleh,"" he says.
Minde describes Saleh as a ""power behind the scenes"", saying he was ""influential in terms of money, business and access"".
Opposition supporters accuse the family of believing they have a God-given right to rule Uganda, with Museveni extending his 40-year-rule after he was declared the winner of the election with more than 70% of the vote.
Indeed Anita Among, the speaker in the last parliament, also used the image of the holy trinity last year, as she rallied voters to back Museveni.
""We believe in God the Father - and God the Father is President Museveni. God the Son is MK [Muhoozi Kainerugaba], and now you [the voters] are the Holy Spirit. Therefore, vote for them,"" she was quoted as saying in comments that came in for some criticism.
After getting just 24% of the vote, Wine dismissed the results as ""fake"", claiming widespread ""ballot-stuffing"" was behind Museveni's victory.
This incurred the wrath of Kainerugaba, who threatened the opposition leader, giving him ""exactly 48 hours to surrender himself to the police"".
""If he doesn't we will treat him as an outlaw/rebel and handle him accordingly,"" he wrote.
Those tweets - and the one in which he threatened to remove Wine's testicles - have since been deleted.
Wine, who had gone into hiding after a raid on his house following the election, later called out the general on X and included a screengrab of some of the deleted tweets - to which Kainerugaba responded with the comment: ""Boo hoo hoo Mr. 24%.""
Another tweet saying Wine was wanted ""dead or alive"" is still on his feed, even though a government minister has said the opposition leader is free to carry out his activities.
The army chief later accused the US of helping Wine escape and said that all military co-operation between the two countries would be suspended.
On Friday, he apologised, saying he had been given ""wrong information"".
He subsequently announced ""I intend to reduce my interactions"" on the social media site. Last year, he said he would leave X before returning after just a few days.
Kainerugaba has a long history of controversial posts, some of which have been later deleted, and is also known as the ""tweeting general"".
He has also invoked religion to advance his political aspirations.
""I fear no one on this planet because my bloodline is from Jesus Christ,"" he posted earlier this month. This tweet has also been deleted.
A long-time friend of the general, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says he is ""incredibly loyal"", and compares his posting to US President Donald Trump.
""He might be Trumpian, but that's him expressing himself,"" the friend tells the BBC.
He says ""it is wrong to try to understand him from the tweets that he posts"", adding that Kainerugaba is ""a man of complex character"".
Minde describes the general's posts as often ""wild"", but says that many of his comments can make sense when viewed within the context of Uganda's succession politics - in particular Kainerugaba's bid to position himself as his father's heir.
""He probably wants to endear himself to his father,"" Minde tells the BBC, but adds that some of the posts are deliberate ""provocations"".
He says that Kainerugaba's statements do little to win him public favour.
Kainerugaba's friend, on the other hand, tells the BBC the general would be an ""incredible successor"" to his father.
He points out that Uganda is a post-conflict country where security is all-important.
""This is our number-one priority, to make sure that you are peaceful and stable and [Kainerugaba] is very experienced in that sphere. He's been doing this all his life,"" he adds.
However, some of his posts could threaten international relations if taken at face-value.
In 2022 he threatened to invade neighbouring Kenya, triggering a backlash from Kenyans who trolled him for his ""reckless"" comments.
He responded by urging them to ""relax"", but as the row escalated, Museveni was forced to phone his Kenyan counterpart William Ruto to apologise for his son's ""mistake"".
Kainerugaba has in the past downplayed some of his remarks as ""musings"" and ""abstractions"" that do not need to be taken seriously.
Uganda-based security analyst Freddie David Egesa observes that the military chief ""enjoys having that kind of vibe"".
""He sometimes likes joking around it,"" Egesa says.
Kainerugaba's friend says the general is ""a kind, generous, intensely smart person who spends all his time thinking about the peace and security of this country"".
He adds that the general executes his responsibilities to the best of his abilities.
""And that's why he serves in the role that he serves.""
Critics say Kainerugaba has brooked little opposition in the country, acting decisively against anyone perceived as a threat to his father's administration.
By the general's own admission on X, at least 30 people were killed and 2,000 others detained by security officers following the recent elections.
Before the polls, opposition rallies were disrupted, with security forces at times opening fire. The United Nations said the election was held in an ""environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation against the political opposition"".
Kainerugaba played a role in the four-day internet blackout that lasted until after the elections, Reuters news agency quoted Andrew Mwenda, a Ugandan political commentator and close ally of the general, as saying.
The internet remained partially restricted afterwards, but on Monday, Kainerugaba posted that access to all social media platforms was being restored.
""We are releasing all social media today,"" he wrote.
On the same day, he took to X to deny that his soldiers had beaten up Bobi Wine's wife Barbara Kyagulanyi.
She had alleged from her hospital bed on Saturday that military officers had assaulted her overnight as they searched for her husband.
According to Minde, Kainerugaba's actions appear driven by loyalty or a desire to protect Museveni's administration. The general's first name, Muhoozi, means avenger.
""I named him Muhoozi, which means vengeance, such that when someone wrongs me, he avenges,"" Museveni once explained.
Kainerugaba, who was born in 1974, grew up in exile in Tanzania, Kenya and Sweden before his father took power in 1986 after overthrowing the brutal regime of Milton Obote.
He joined the military in 1999, enrolled at the UK's elite Sandhurst military academy and graduated the following year. He is married with several children.
He rapidly rose through the military ranks shortly after joining the army, reaching the rank of lieutenant-general 10 years later. He was promoted to a full general in 2022.
He played a pivotal role in the formation of the Special Forces Command (SFC), an elite military unit responsible for his father's security.
The SFC has been accused of involvement in a wave of abductions and torture of opposition members. It has denied the allegations, but some of its officers have been convicted of abusing their power.
The most prominent case was that of a 32-year-old SFC soldier, who was court-martialled and sentenced to death in 2024 for shooting dead three people and injuring two others, including a one-year-old child.
And after a bodyguard of Wine, Edward Sebuufu went missing last May, Kainerugaba revealed on X that he was in detention ""in my basement"", and sparked a social media storm after he published a photo of him appearing half-naked and with his beard shaved off.
As with Wine, he threatened to castrate Sebuufu.
Wine has alleged that members of the SFC, as well as the military, were behind a raid on his home the day after the election.
The unit is viewed as a shadow army that has helped Museveni, along with his ever-growing family dynasty, to consolidate power.
The latest addition to the political dynasty is Kainerugaba's son, Ruhamya, who has joined the army - seen as the first step to acquiring power in Uganda.
In the years to come, the composition of the trinity could change, with Kainerugaba as the Father, Ruhamya as the Son and another family patriarch succeeding Saleh as the Spirit.

Mali lawmaker jailed in Ivory Coast for insulting president,2026-01-30T18:09:20.103Z," Nicolas Négoce
BBC Africa
Abidjan
","A Malian lawmaker has been jailed in neighbouring Ivory Coast for three years for insulting the 84-year-old Ivorian leader, who recently won a fourth term in office.
Mamadou Hawa Gassama, who serves in the transitional parliament set up by Mali's junta, was arrested last July while on a trip to Ivory Coast.
Prosecutors said he described President Alassane Ouattara as a ""tyrant"", ""an enemy of Mali"" and strongly criticised his leadership in interviews and on social media.
Since Mali's military took power in 2020, relations with Ivory Coast have been strained. Ouattara, an ally of France - the former colonial power in both nations - has been critical of the takeover and other coups in West Africa.
Since the Malian politician's arrest in Abidjan last July, the authorities in Bamako have not commented on the case.
""We believe that this decision is... excessive... it is very severe,"" the AFP news agency quotes Gassama's lawyer Mamadou Ismaila Konate as saying.
Prosecutors argued that Gassama's remarks went beyond political critique, accusing him of deliberately seeking to undermine Ivorian institutions and sow discord between the two neighbours.
It is a reminder of the diplomatic row that blew up two years after the coup, when 49 Ivorian soldiers were sentenced in Mali to 20 years in prison for undermining state security.
At the time Ivory Coast denied the allegation and said they had been sent to Mali as part of a UN mission fighting militant Islamists. They were freed after mediation efforts led by Togo.
Since then, Mali's military leaders have overseen the exit of the UN peacekeeping mission and French forces, which had deployed to Mali in 2013 to help deal with an escalating jihadist insurgency.
Instead it has sought closer ties with Russia - and Russian mercenaries have been brought in to deal with the insecurity affecting several countries in the vast Sahel region.

Suspected jihadists attack airport near Niger's capital,2026-01-30T17:25:09.506Z," Chris EwokorandBasillioh Rukanga
","Suspected jihadists have launched an attack on the international airport outside Niger's capital Niamey.
Niger's defence ministry said four military personnel were injured and 20 attackers were killed, with state television saying that a French national was among them.
There were 11 arrests over the attack at Diori Hamani International Airport overnight from Wednesday to Thursday, in which sustained heavy gunfire and loud explosions were heard nearby.
On Friday, the Islamic State group, through its Amaq information service, said it was behind the ""co-ordinated surprise attack"" targeting ""the military base"" of the Niger army.
No casualty figures were given but Amaq said the assault had caused ""major damage"".
Eyewitness accounts and videos showed air defence systems apparently engaging unidentified projectiles in the early hours of Thursday but services at the airport returned to normal during the day.
The head of Niger's junta on Thursday thanked Russia for its help in foiling the attack on the airport, and accused the presidents of France, Benin and Ivory Coast of backing those responsible.
He did not give details of what help Russia had provided, or provide any evidence to support his accusations against the other countries.
The military which seized power in a July 2023 coup have frosty relations with France and Benin, and regularly accuse them of trying to destabilise Niger, which both countries deny.
""We commend all the defence and security forces... as well as Russian partners who defended their security sector with professionalism,"" General Abdourahamane Tiani said on state radio.
""We remind the sponsors of these mercenaries, notably Emmanuel Macron, Patrice Talon and Alassane Ouattara: we've heard them bark quite enough; now they should get ready to listen to us.""
Since the coup, Niger's junta has cut military ties with France, the former colonial power, and instead worked with Russia to help tackle the Islamist fighters who have been fighting in the region for over a decade.
Niger's Defence Minister Salifou Modi said in a statement on public television that the mercenaries attacked an air base in the capital for ""about 30 minutes"" before an ""air and ground response"".
The channel broadcast footage of Tiani visiting the military base, showing the bodies of the attackers and said there was ""a Frenchman"" among them.
The airport houses an air force base and is about 10km (six miles) from the presidential place.
One local resident told the BBC that shots had been fired from outside the airport, targeting planes.
Others described their fear as they heard the gunshots and explosions.
“We didn't sleep last night,"" said one resident. ""Our room and the whole house was shaking from the gunshots and explosions,” she said.
""Yesterday was the first time I have ever heard gunfire,"" another woman said. ""We were so scared.""
Several unconfirmed reports said unknown assailants had thrown explosive devices towards the airport area before exchanging fire with security forces.
According to the FlightRadar24 website, several flights bound for Niamey were diverted.
AFP reports there was a heavy security deployment around the airport on Thursday morning.
Niger is a major producer of uranium.
A huge uranium shipment destined for export has been stuck at the airport amid unresolved legal and diplomatic complications with France after the military government nationalised the country's uranium mines.
The shipment was unharmed in the attack, according to sources cited by Reuters news agency.

Burkina Faso junta announces ban on all political parties,2026-01-30T13:57:56.356Z," Wedaeli ChibelushiandNicolas Négoce
BBC Africa
","Burkina Faso's junta has announced a ban on all political parties, whose activities have been suspended since the military seized power in 2022.
Junta leader Captain Ibrahim Traoré has been criticised for suppressing dissent and the move will be seen as the latest move to tighten control.
According to Burkina Faso's Interior Minister Emile Zerbo, the ban is part of plans to ""rebuild the state"" after what he said were ""numerous abuses"" in the country's multiparty system.
Zerbo said the system had been ""promoting division among citizens and weakening the social fabric"".
Parties were previously banned from holding public gatherings but the new decree stops them from operating altogether.
All the assets of the dissolved parties would be transferred to the state, Zerbo said, adding that a draft law would be sent to the Transitional Legislative Assembly ""as soon as possible"".
The country had more than 100 registered political parties before the coup, with 15 represented in parliament after the 2020 general election.
""This will not help the country move forward. We're not happy with this,"" a member of a civil society group, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, told the BBC.
""The regime has been pushing the idea that democracy is useless or harmful for Burkina. [Traoré] may be settling in for the long run but given the country's history, no leader is ever fully secure. Another coup is never far from the horizon.""
The banning of political parties also received some backlash on social media, but a number of other Burkinabes went online to support the junta's decision.
""It is undeniable that a country like Burkina Faso having over 100 political parties creates chaos,"" one Traoré supporter said on X.
""This fragmentation often led to clientelism and corruption, where parties function more like business ventures than civic organisations.""
Traoré's 2022 coup ousted Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who had taken power only nine months earlier.
Traoré pledged to restore the civilian government by 1 July 2024 but two months before this deadline, the junta announced it would extend its rule for another five years.
Despite his authoritarian reputation, 37-year-old Traoré has gained a huge following across the continent for his pan-Africanist vision and criticism of Western influence.
Burkina Faso is one of several West African countries who have experienced coups, followed by the restriction of political parties and electoral institutions, in recent years.
One of the coup leaders, Guinea's Gen Mamady Doumbouya, last month stood for election and won by a landslide.

"
Music legend Fela Kuti becomes first African to get Grammys Lifetime Achievement Award,2026-01-30T00:13:13.981Z," Mark Wilberforce
","Long crowned by his legion of fans as the king of Afrobeat, the late Fela Kuti is finally being recognised by the global music industry.
The Nigerian star will posthumously receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammys - almost three decades after his death at the age of 58.
""Fela has been in the hearts of the people for such a long time. Now the Grammys have acknowledged it, and it's a double victory,"" his musician son Seun Kuti tells the BBC.
""It's bringing balance to a Fela story,"" he adds.
Rikki Stein, a long-time friend and manager of the late musician, says the recognition by the Grammys is ""better late than never"".
""Africa hasn't in the past rated very highly in their interests. I think that's changing quite a bit of late,"" Stein tells the BBC.
Following the global success of Afrobeats, a genre inspired by Fela's sound, the Grammys introduced the category of Best African Performance in 2024.
This year, Nigerian superstar Burna Boy also has a nomination in the Best Global Music Album category.
But Fela Kuti will be the first African to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award, albeit posthumously. The award was first presented in 1963 to American singer and actor Bing Crosby.
Other musicians who will receive the award this year include Mexican-American guitarist Carlos Santana, Chaka Khan, the American singer known as the Queen of Funk, and Paul Simon.
Fela Kuti's family, as well friends and colleagues, will be attending the Grammys to receive his award.
""The global human tapestry needs this, not just because it's my father,"" Seun Kuti tells the BBC.
Stein says it is important to recognise Fela as a man who championed the cause of people who had ""drawn life's short straw"", adding that he ""castigated any form of social injustice, corruption [and] mismanagement"" in government.
""So it would be impossible to ignore that aspect of Fela's legacy,"" he tells the BBC.
For Fela Anikulapo Kuti was not simply a musician, but also a cultural theorist, political agitator and the undisputed architect of Afrobeat - which is distinct from, but ultimately led to, the modern sound of Afrobeats.
He pioneered the Afrobeat genre alongside drummer Tony Allen, blending West African rhythms, jazz, funk, highlife, extended improvisation, call-and-response vocals and politically charged lyricism.
Across a career spanning roughly three decades until his death in 1997, Fela Kuti released more than 50 albums and built a body of work that fused music with ideology, rhythm with resistance, and performance with protest.
His music incurred the wrath of Nigeria's then-military regimes.
In 1977, after the release of the album Zombie, which satirised government soldiers as obedient, brainless enforcers, his compound in the main city, Lagos, was raided.
Known as Kalakuta Republic, the property was burned, residents were brutalised, and his mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, later died from injuries sustained during the assault.
Rather than retreat, Fela Kuti responded through music and defiance. He took his mother's coffin to government offices and released the song Coffin for Head of State, turning grief into protest.
The musician's ideology was a blend of pan-Africanism, anti-imperialism, and African-rooted socialism.
Fela Kuti's mother was hugely influential in his life, helping shape his political consciousness, while the US-born singer and activist Sandra Izsadore helped sharpen his revolutionary outlook
He was born Olufela Olusegun Oludoton Ransome-Kuti, but dropped Ransome because of its Western roots.
In 1978, he married 27 women in a highly publicised ceremony, bringing together partners, performers, organisers and co-architects of the cultural and communal vision of Kalakuta Republic.
Fela Kuti endured repeated arrests, beatings, censorship and surveillance by the security forces. Yet repression only amplified his influence.
""He wasn't doing what he was doing to win awards. He was interested in liberation. Freeing the mind,"" Stein tells the BBC.
""He was fearless. He was determined.""
Fela Kuti's musical evolution was shaped not only by Nigeria but also by Ghana. During the 1950s and 1960s, highlife music, pioneered by Ghanaian musicians such as ET Mensah, Ebo Taylor and Pat Thomas, became a defining sound across West Africa.
Its melodic guitar lines, horn sections, dance rhythms, and cosmopolitan identity deeply influenced Fela Kuti's early musical direction.
He spent time in Ghana absorbing highlife's structure, horn phrasing, and dance-oriented arrangements before fusing it with jazz, funk, the rhythms of his own Yoruba people, and political storytelling.
The DNA of highlife can be heard in Afrobeat's melodic sensibility and its balance between groove and sophistication.
In this sense, Afrobeat is not only Nigerian. It is West African, pan-African, and diasporic in origin, carrying Ghana's musical imprint at its foundation.
On stage, Fela Kuti cut an unmistakable figure. Often bare-chested or draped in the wax-printed fabric popular across West Africa, hair shaped into a crisp Afro, saxophone in hand, eyes alert with intensity, he commanded a large band of more than 20 musicians.
His performances at the Afrika Shrine in Lagos were legendary, part concert, part political rally, part spiritual ceremony.
Stein recalls that performances at the Shrine were immersive rather than conventional.
""When Fela played, nobody applauded,"" he tells the BBC. ""The audience wasn't separate. They were part of it.""
Music was not spectacle. It was communion.
Fela Kuti's visual identity was shaped in part by artist and designer Lemi Ghariokwu, who created 26 of his album covers between 1974 and 1993.
""Fela has been an ancestor for 28 years. His legacy is growing by the day. This is immortality,"" Ghariokwu tells the BBC, welcoming the posthumous award.
Today, Fela Kuti's music is still popular with millions around the world, and his influence is audible in modern artists such as Burna Boy, Kendrick Lamar and Sir Idris Elba.
Elba is a huge fan - the award-winning actor and DJ has curated an official vinyl box set, Fela Kuti Box Set 6, and has publicly compared him to icons such as Sade and Frank Sinatra to illustrate the point that Fela Kuti has his own unique sound.
Fela Kuti performed at major international festivals in Europe and North America, introducing global audiences to a bold and politically charged version of modern Africa.
Seun Kuti was just 14 when his father died.
""Fela never made me feel like I was a child,"" he recalls. ""He didn't hide anything from me. He talked about everything openly.""
There was no myth-building.
""I didn't even realise my dad was famous,"" he says. ""That's credit to him. He kept me grounded.""
What stayed with him most was not spectacle, but discipline, clarity and humanity.
""The human part of him, leadership, musicianship, fatherhood, that was the epitome of who he was.""
One of Seun Kuti's most revealing reflections speaks to independence and identity.
""Fela was our dad, but you didn't own him. Fela belonged to himself. But we all belonged to him.""
Fela Kuti insisted on being addressed by name, not by title, even by his children. Seun recalls having his pocket money docked after calling him ""Pops"", a moment that carried a lesson in respect.
""He always reminded us that he was in service to others more than himself.""
That ethic shaped Seun's evolution from youthful ambition toward cultural responsibility.
""I used to make music to make money. But as I've grown, I lean more toward working for my people as well as my art.""
Fela Kuti led multiple ensembles, most famously Africa 70 and later Egypt 80, the latter now carried forward by his son.
These were not conventional backing bands. They were musical militias, trained in discipline, endurance, and ideological purpose.
Stein recalls Fela Kuti's obsessive attention to detail.
""He tuned every instrument personally. Music wasn't entertainment to him. It was his mission.""

"Ex-Nigerian oil minister did not take bribes from industry insiders, court told",2026-01-29T19:38:30.800Z," Steve Swann
","A former Nigerian oil minister accused of corruption did not request or receive bribes from industry insiders, a court in London has heard.
Diezani Alison-Madueke's defence barrister told Southwark Crown Court that money spent on her behalf on properties and luxury goods in the UK was reimbursed in Nigeria.
Others paid for her living costs because ""Nigerian ministers are forbidden from having bank accounts abroad"" said Jonathan Laidlaw KC.
""Those who paid the bills were paid back, in Nigeria…She did not request or receive any financial advantage from these individuals"".
Earlier this week Southwark Crown Court heard allegations that Alison-Madueke was provided with ""a life of luxury in the United Kingdom"" which included the use of multi-million pound properties, a chauffeur-driven car, travel by private jet and spending sprees in high-end stores, including over £2m in Harrods.
Alison-Madueke was Nigeria's minister of petroleum resources between 2010 and 2015, described in court as the most senior ministerial position after that of the president.
She denies five counts of accepting bribes and a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery.
The court heard how an investigation into her began in 2013. She was first arrested in 2015 at a time when she was receiving cancer treatment in London. She was not charged until 2023.
There was ""a gross delay in bringing these charges"" which has placed her at a disadvantage"", said Laidlaw.
""She has been denied, forbidden the chance to travel to her home in Nigeria to prepare her defence,"" he said.
Records at her home in Abuja showing that her living expenses had been reimbursed no longer exist.
""Through no fault of her own she doesn't have available to her the material that supports her defence…It really is quite a disadvantage.""
The court also heard how the businessmen named as having given the alleged bribes have not been charged and there have been no attempts to extradite them.
""All are spread around the world and they have their liberty to this day"" said Laidlaw.
He said his client may not attract any sympathy at first glance but ""one of the basics of any jury trial is the concept of fairness. And as a matter of fairness, whatever your instinctive view may be about Mrs Alison-Madueke you may think that the absence of material that a defendant would wish her jury to see, is a real disadvantage.""
Also on trial are oil industry executive Olatimbo Ayinde, 54, who denies one count of bribery relating to Alison-Madueke and a separate count of bribery of a foreign public official.
Alison-Madueke's brother, former bishop Doye Agama, 69, denies conspiracy to commit bribery.
The trial continues.

Flights to northern Ethiopia cancelled as fears mount of renewed conflict,2026-01-29T11:59:18.967Z," Michael Teferi
BBC Africa
","Passenger flights between Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, and cities in the northern Tigray region have been cancelled amid fears of a return to conflict, with reports of clashes in one area.
Ethiopian Airlines, which operates all routes in the country, sent passengers a text message about the cancellations citing ""unplanned circumstances"". Neither the airline nor the government has commented further.
Airport staff in Tigray's main city of Mekelle have reportedly been told not to go to work.
A 2022 peace deal to end a brutal civil war in Tigray has been unravelling as tensions grow over disputed territory and ahead of June's elections.
There are reports of clashes between the federal army and Tigray fighters in Mai Degusha, a contested area of Tselemti district in western Tigray.
During the conflict, forces from the neighbouring Amhara region occupied the fertile area of western Tigray, which remains a source of dispute.
The government has said it will be settled through a referendum but around a million people fled that area during the war and remain in poor conditions in makeshift camps throughout Tigray - and it is not clear whether they will get a vote.
Sources also report new military movements in southern Tigray, raising concerns of renewed conflict.
Ethiopian Airlines has not yet issued an official statement or explanation regarding the suspension of its flights.
The African Union (AU) brokered the truce between the government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - known as the Pretoria Agreement - which set up an interim administration to run Tigray.
Tigray's transport chief Tadele Mengistu confirmed to the BBC that flights had been cancelled but said he did not have detailed information about the reasons behind the decision.
Buses are still operating between Addis Ababa and Tigray, though they may be subject to disruptions following the suspension of flights.
Relations between the TPLF and the government have been deteriorating for a while.
Following the Pretoria deal, the TPLF, which was designated a terrorist group during the war, wanted its legal status as a political party to be reinstated.
But the process has been dogged by disagreements and the electoral board recently revoked the TPLF's licence - meaning it cannot contest the national elections in June.
The TPLF itself has split into factions, complicating an already tense situation. The party had dominated Ethiopia's political landscape for two decades until Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018 and set up a new party, which TPLF leaders refused to join.
An AU envoy estimated that 600,000 people were killed during the Tigray war with all sides accused of gross abuses, such as the mass killing of civilians and widespread sexual violence.

"Ex-Nigerian minister in bribery trial went on spending sprees, court hears",2026-01-28T21:01:18.417Z," Steve Swann
Southwark Crown Court
","A Nigerian oil minister went on ""extravagant and excessive"" spending sprees at high-end London stores with money from bribes by industry insiders, a London court has heard.
During a visit to Harrods in 2013, Diezani Alison-Madueke ordered thousands of pounds worth of rugs, including by luxury brand Alexander McQueen, Southwark Crown Court was told.
Prosecutors allege the 65-year-old was provided with ""a life of luxury in the United Kingdom"" by those interested in Nigerian government contracts.
Alison-Madueke, who was Nigeria's minister of petroleum resources between 2010 and 2015, denies five counts of accepting bribes and a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery.
The court heard that during the Harrods visit in November 2013, Alison-Madueke was allegedly accompanied by Nigerian businessman Kolawole Aluko and a security guard.
According to a sales executive working in the store, the then-minister looked ""extremely glamorous and was wearing very expensive clothing"".
Alison-Madueke was also a regular shopper at Vincenzo Cafferella, a decorative arts and furniture store in north London, where she was known as ""Sharon D"", the court was told.
The prosecution alleges that between October 2012 and November 2013, Aluko bought various items, including lamps and tables, for Alison-Madueke costing more than £370,000.
The court heard Alison-Madueke would also spend hours in Thomas Goode, a china and silverware shop in Mayfair, and once arrived with an entourage of about four or five people.
A worker there remembered her loving the sales and saying to him: ""I don't even know why I'm buying this, I haven't got the room for it.""
The court was told items were often bought but not collected and that Alison-Madueke never paid for anything herself.
Instead, the bills were understood to be settled by Aluko and other Nigerian businessmen said to own energy companies that had lucrative contracts with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation when Alison-Madueke was oil minister.
Ex-Nigeria oil minister in bribery trial spent £2m at Harrods, court hears
The court was also told about shipments of furniture bought for Alison-Madueke from a luxury store in Houston, Texas for several properties in London which the prosecution allege were used by the former minister.
Two of the properties were said to be bought by Nigerian businessman Benedict Peters. The jury was shown photographs from inside one of them, which included items allegedly bought for Alison-Madueke.
Alison-Madueke's driver recalled collecting her and then-President of Nigeria Goodluck Jonathan from the same address, the court heard.
Other spending on the minister's behalf allegedly included £89,410 to charter a jet from Luton to Lagos in Nigeria in January 2012, as well as a delivery of £100,000 cash from a bank in north London to her at a nearby flat.
The court was also told that Alison-Madueke's phone was seized in 2015 during police searches, revealing recorded conversations in which she is said to have confronted Aluko over suggestions he had spoken about the gifts given to her at a time when their relationship was breaking down.
In a conversation in May 2014, Alison-Madueke told Aluko she was really annoyed, given that she and others had ""stuck our necks out"" when negotiating oil mining leases.
""I will be happy to escort all of you to jail along with myself… you'll be shocked what I will do"", she is alleged to have said, adding: ""I will come out and tell the Nigerian people this is what happened.
""Oh yes, I will blame myself… I will come out openly and say it so that they can judge me openly. And then all of us go and sit on the gate let us see who survived.""
In another instance, Igho Sanomi, an oil executive whose company was awarded Nigerian state contracts between 2011 and 2015, carried out shopping errands in London for Alison-Madueke, the court heard.
Text messages recovered from her phone showed Sanomi pledging his ""loyalty and commitment"", and agreeing to collect Louis Vuitton hat boxes, replying: ""Yes Your Excellency consider this done"".
By 2014 he expressed concern their relationship was deteriorating and so he allegedly sent Alison-Madueke an email calling himself her ""true soldier"".
Three weeks later, Sanomi's company was part of a consortium that was awarded a new oil mining lease by her, the court heard.
Alison-Madueke's brother, former bishop Doye Agama, 69, is also charged with conspiracy to commit bribery, with prosecutors claiming he was paid £1.2m in bribes by businessman Peters.
The payments were intended to ""induce Alison-Madueke to perform her duties as the Nigerian minister of petroleum resources improperly,"" lawyers told the court.
Also on trial is industry executive Olatimbo Ayinde, 54, who is charged with one count of bribery relating to Alison-Madueke and a separate count of bribery of a foreign public official.
Both Agama and Ayinde deny the charges.
The trial continues.

US YouTube star IShowSpeed to get Ghanaian passport as Africa tour ends,2026-01-28T16:30:34.903Z," Paul Njie
BBC Africa
","IShowSpeed, one of the world's most popular content creators, is set to receive a Ghanaian passport following his highly anticipated trip to the West African nation.
Ghana was the penultimate stop on the US influencer's live-streamed, 20-country tour of Africa, which wrapped up on Tuesday.
Following IShowSpeed's visit, Ghana's foreign minister announced that his office had approved a passport for the YouTuber, who he called a ""worthy ambassador"".
The ""Speed Does Africa"" tour has been watched around the world, with many praising it for helping to break stereotypes about the continent and showcasing numerous African cultures to the world.
IShowSpeed, aged 21, whose real name is Darren Watkins Jr, has more than 50 million YouTube subscribers, with his Africa tour contributing to the growth of his platform.
His Ghanaian passport was approved following ""confirmation of the irrefutable ties of IShowSpeed to Ghana"", Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa posted on social media.
While streaming in Ghana, the YouTuber told his audience that his mother was from the West African country.
In his post, Ablakwa urged IShowSpeed to ""keep making our great nation Ghana, and our beloved African continent proud"". ""Ghana celebrates you"", he added.
Many Ghanaians responded positively to Ablakwa's announcement, but some accused the government of ""devaluing"" the country's passport by handing them to foreign celebrities.
In recent years, Ghana has sought to promote itself throughout Africa's huge global diaspora.
In 2024, the country offered Ghanaian citizenship to over 500 members of the diaspora. The recipients were mostly African-Americans, like the legendary US singer Stevie Wonder.
Other West African countries have also offered nationality to the descendants of those who were taken to the Americas during the slave trade.
During his visit to Ghana on Monday, IShowSpeed said he felt as though he was ""back home,"" and spent the day visiting iconic locations in the country.
He travelled to Ghana's eastern region, where he took part in a traditional naming ceremony. Wearing the famous local kente cloth, he was given the name Barima Kofi Akuffo.
During his 28-day tour of Africa, IShowSpeed visited countries including Nigeria, South Africa, Morocco and Ivory Coast.
He participated in various crowd-pulling activities, including racing a cheetah and dancing with members of the Masaai ethnic group.
IShowSpeed celebrated his 21st birthday with cake in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city.
Rolling Stone magazine named him the ""most influential creator of 2025"" and Forbes estimates his net worth to be $20m (£14.5m).

The model who moved to Ghana and wrapped her prosthetic leg in its famous fabric,2026-01-28T00:17:35.095Z," Mark Wilberforce
Accra
","It was hard to miss 33-year-old model and writer Abena Christine Jon'el's appearance at a recent major fashion show in Ghana.
Walking the runway with her prosthetic leg wrapped in a colourful African print her appearance made a big impact.
The Ghanaian-American was hoping to make a statement about the visibility of people with disabilities, building on years of work in the US and here in Ghana of speaking out on the issue.
At two years old, Abena's life became defined by a challenge most adults would struggle to face.
A large tumour had appeared on her right calf, the first sign of a rare, aggressive soft-tissue cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma. Doctors presented her mother with a difficult choice: radiation, which could have left her dependent on a wheelchair, or amputation. Her mother chose the latter.
""It was the best decision she could have made,"" Abena says today without hesitation, speaking to the BBC surrounded by friends and family at a restaurant in the Ghanaian capital, Accra.
She now lives in Ghana, but she grew up in Chicago in the US.
Even before she understood what cancer was, her early life was shaped by treatment and recovery. Movement became a way of measuring survival and rebuilding confidence. In a way, it was taking ownership of a body that had been through so much.
But when she speaks about her younger years, it is not the cliché story of the inspirational disabled child sometimes presented in glossy campaigns: a compliant person bravely but silently triumphing against adversity.
She rejects that stereotype entirely.
""People imagine disabled kids as straight-A students who are sweet, quiet and perfect,"" she says.
""I was the opposite. I was loud, I was a little black girl running around on one leg, I did not let anyone push me around, and I was struggling through school.""
Her disability never softened her personality, it sharpened it.
And that sharpness, what she now jokingly describes as her ""professionally inspirational"" energy, is the very thing that would later carry her through life.
In the US, she worked as a writer – initially as a poet – and then became a public speaker talking about her life experiences, in the hope of inspiring people.
She wanted people to see what she was accomplishing and to ""let me hold a mirror so you can see yourself and what you can accomplish if you believe"".
Long before she dabbled with public speaking or modelling, Abena felt a pull towards Africa, a feeling she could not articulate but could not ignore.
As a young adult in the US, she immersed herself in books on the history of Africa before colonialism, particularly West Africa. The more she read, the stronger the pull became.
But it was her first visit to Ghana in 2021 that changed everything.
In the central region of Ghana, standing at the Assin Manso slave river site – where enslaved people were sold before travelling about 40km (25 miles) south to the coast - she experienced what she describes as ""a moment that rearranged my entire understanding of myself"".
The weight of history met the weight of belonging, forming a sense of identity she had never felt growing up in the US.
When she returned, she fell into a deep depression.
""It felt like I had finally found a missing part of myself in Ghana,"" she says.""Leaving felt like being torn away from somewhere my soul belonged.""
Three months later, she packed her bags and moved permanently.
Ghana embraced her in ways she still struggles to describe.
""I am Ghanaian by ancestry and adoption,"" she says with pride.
Over the four years she has lived in Accra, Ghanaians have claimed her in the way only Ghana knows how, with warmth, with teasing, with family, and with names. She now lives with a Ghanaian mother who introduces her as her own daughter.
""My Ghanaian identity is not pretend,"" she says. ""It is not cosplay. It is ancestral. Like Kwame Nkrumah said: 'I am not African because I was born in Africa, but because Africa was born in me.' That is exactly what Ghana is to me.""
Her prosthetic leg itself is a declaration of that love.
Wrapped in kente, it is as much a cultural symbol as it is a mobility aid.
""It always has been, and always will be, kente,"" she says. ""It represents my love for this country, its heritage, its pride.""
Living with a disability in Ghana has brought a new mission into her life, one that goes far beyond personal expression.
For Abena, the difference between how disabled people are treated in the US and Ghana comes down to visibility and access.
""In the States, progress is happening, slowly, imperfectly, but happening. Disabled people are being invited into more spaces,"" she explains. ""It is still ableist, but at least there is an attempt to change the narrative.""
Ghana, she says, is still at the beginning of that journey. Not for lack of compassion, but for lack of representation.
After her move, she continued to speak out for the rights of people with disabilities.
""In Ghana, disabled people have not been widely showcased in a positive light,"" she says. ""So stigma thrives. Negativity thrives. People do not see us in powerful or beautiful or joyful positions, they see us only in struggle.""
Her advocacy is built on changing that perception. Not with pity, but with visibility.
With her kente prosthetic, unfiltered personality and refusal to shrink herself to fit public expectations, Abena wants Ghanaians to see disabled people as they are: ambitious, stylish, talented, complex, proud and human.
""Disability is not a limitation. Having a disability is not what makes you disabled,"" she says.
""Lack of support, lack of accessibility, that is what disables you.""
Her advocacy found a new stage, literally, at the 15th edition of Rhythms on the Runway, one of Africa's most celebrated annual fashion shows, which took place last month at Accra's historic Osu Castle.
In the build-up to the show, Abena approached the organisers directly.
She knew what her presence would mean, not just for herself, but for Ghana. She wanted to open the door to a different kind of representation, to force a conversation the country had delayed for too long.
""I knew it would be a monumental moment for Rhythms on the Runway and for Ghana,"" she says. ""If I wanted inclusivity in the industry, I had to be willing to take that first step.""
And she did.
When she stepped onto the runway, draped in fabric and confidence, her prosthetic gleaming under the spotlights, the room shifted. What happened next became one of the most talked about moments of the night.
""Her strength showed right through, speaking volumes. 'I am differently able and I have got this,'"" Tourism, Culture and Arts Minister Abla Dzifa Gomashie said.
""Her walk was not just a performance it was a powerful affirmation that talent, beauty, and confidence know no limitations. We are proud to have provided a platform where her light could shine so boldly,"" fashion show organiser Shirley Emma Tibilla said.
""Abena's presence was absolutely powerful. This is what true inclusion looks like, celebrating every story, everybody, and every ability,"" Dentaa Amoateng, entrepreneur and founder of the Guba diaspora investment awards added.
But for Abena, the significance of the evening was not the applause. It was the message. Disabled people were not just spectators that night, they were centre stage.
Standing at the intersection of identity, disability, heritage and fashion, Abena represents a new way forward for Ghana, one where inclusion is not quietly suggested, but boldly demanded.
Her journey from a two-year-old cancer patient to a woman reshaping how Ghana sees disability is not a story of survival, it is a story of reclamation.
She reclaimed her identity, reclaimed her mobility, reclaimed her belonging and reclaimed her place in a country that, in her words, ""fought for me before I even stepped foot here"".
Her work is far from finished. But whether she is on a runway, behind a microphone, or mentoring young amputees, one thing is constant, she refuses to dim her light. And she refuses to let others like her be dimmed either.
""Ghana is my home,"" she says.

Nigeria president 'in great shape' after falling at Turkey reception,2026-01-27T21:33:25.029Z," Mansur Abubakar
Abuja
","Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu is ""in great shape"" despite falling over at a reception ceremony in Turkey, one of his aides said.
Tinubu, 73, was being welcomed by his Turkish counterpart at an official ceremony in the capital, Ankara, when he stumbled.
After walking past a line of soldiers and dignitaries Tinubu can be seen on the official video on the Turkish president's X account moving to his right when he stumbles and falls. The film briefly shows people helping the president before cutting to an aerial shot and 45 seconds later Tinubu and Recep Tayyip Erdogan are seen next to each other.
Tinubu appeared unhurt and aide Sunday Dare said he was able to continue with a bilateral meeting.
Video clips of the incident are being shared on social media.
A spokesman for the president, Bayo Onanuga, later said that Tinubu had stepped on a metal object ""on the floor, which made him lose his balance"".
""This is not a big deal, except for those who want to make mischief out of a fleeting incident. It was a mere stumble, thank God, not a fall,"" he added.
The last time the president fell over in public, in June 2024, he made a joke about it, saying people thought he was doing a popular dance move.
At that time the incident was described as a ""mild misstep"" by an aide, and there was also a lot of sympathy for Tinubu, including from leading opposition politician Atiku Abubakar, who called it an ""unfortunate incident"".
Another politician, Shehu Sani, said that it showed the president was a human being and no different to anyone else.
In an apparent move to allay concerns on Tuesday afternoon, in an all capital letters headline, Dare said on X: ""President Tinubu in great shape as state visit proceeds smoothly.
""After a stately welcome ceremony in Ankara [he] proceeded to scheduled bilateral meetings with President of Turkey and other senior government officials from both countries.""
He did not give further details.
Tinubu's visit to Turkey was ""aimed at strengthening the existing cordial relations"", the president's office said in a statement before he left for Ankara on Monday.
After the two presidents met, Turkey announced new economic, trade and defence cooperation agreements with Nigeria.
Speaking at a joint press conference with Tinubu, Erdogan said both countries had reaffirmed a target of increasing total bilateral trade to $5bn (£3.6bn).
The two countries also exchanged agreements on defence cooperation. Turkey pledged support for Nigeria's fight against militants, as well as deeper collaboration in military training and intelligence sharing.
""Nigeria remains open for serious partnership. Open to trade without barriers. Open to ideas, skills, and investment that create value and shared prosperity,"" Tinubu posted on X later.
Tinubu took office in 2023 after beating Abubakar in a presidential election.

South Sudan army threat to 'spare no-one' condemned,2026-01-27T11:05:24.391Z," Nichola Mandil
Juba
Alfred Lasteck
BBC AfricaandJean Otalor
","The UN says it is gravely concerned after a senior military leader in South Sudan urged his troops to ""spare no-one"" including ""children, the elderly, and civilians"" when they are deployed to opposition-held areas of the country.
""Inflammatory rhetoric calling for violence against civilians... is utterly abhorrent and must stop now,"" said the head of the UN's mission in South Sudan.
South Sudan's deputy army chief Gen Johnson Oluny made the call as he addressed his Agwelek militia as they prepared to be sent to parts of Jonglei state. The government said this was not an order.
Forces aligned to South Sudan's suspended Vice-President Riek Machar have captured several areas in recent weeks.
He is currently on trial on charges of murder, treason and crimes against humanity, which he denies.
The military has ordered all civilians and personnel from the UN mission and all other aid agencies to evacuate three counties in Jonglei state ahead of an imminent operation against opposition forces.
Last week, the chief of the defence force ordered troops deployed in the region to ''crush the rebellion'' within seven days.
Oluny can be heard addressing his troops in a video posted on Facebook saying: ""spare no-one - the elderly, children, birds or leave no house standing"".
But in an interview with the BBC's Newsday programme the government denied that the statement made by the deputy army chief amounted to an order.
""The government is committed to ensure the protection of civilians. We give warnings to civilians, in order not to be caught up in a crossfire. The government is responsible and are protecting civilians,'' Minister of Information Ateny Wek Ateny said.
The UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (UNCHRSS) expressed ""grave alarm"" at the latest fighting in Jonglei state, north of the capital Juba, where witnesses have described civilians fleeing into swamps.
The UN says more than 180,000 people are believed to have been forced to flee their homes by escalating fighting.
''No senior political or military leader in Juba can claim to be unaware of the blatant public incitements to commit serious crimes in Jonglei,'' the UNCHRSS said in a statement issued on Sunday night in Geneva.
""Language that calls for the killing of those who are hors de combat [no longer participating in hostilities] and civilians, including the elderly—with assertions that 'no one should be spared'—is not only shocking, it is profoundly dangerous,"" said UNCHRSS head Yasmin Sooka.
The military said all civilians living in Nyirol, Uror and Akobo counties in Jonglei were ""directed to immediately evacuate for safety to government-controlled areas as soon as possible.""
All personnel from the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (Unmiss) and those working for non-governmental organisations were also ordered to evacuate the three counties within 48 hours.
An Unmiss spokesperson told Reuters news agency: ""Our peacekeepers in Akobo remain in place, carrying out all efforts under our mandate to help de-escalate tensions and prevent conflict."" She did not say whether UN staff also remained in the other counties.
South Sudan's main opposition group, Machar's Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO), told the BBC its forces expect to reach the capital, Juba, by the end of February.
However, the army has dismissed the threat, saying the opposition lacks the capacity to attack the capital.
""We are not sure if they will have the courage to face us, but we are prepared for any eventualities,"" said army spokesperson Gen Lul Ruai Koang.
Koang said that although the SPLM-IO currently controls some counties in Jonglei, Bor, the state capital, remains under government control.
Conflict in South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, broke out in 2013, two years after independence, when President Salva Kiir accused Machar of plotting to overthrow him.
A 2018 peace deal ended the civil war that had killed nearly 400,000 people, but it has never been properly implemented and the relationship between Kiir and Machar has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.
A power-sharing agreement between the two main sides is all but dead after President Salva Kiir moved against Machar, his vice-president and long-time rival Machar, who was arrested last March.
During the civil war the country was divided along ethnic lines, as the army and political elite fractured and the conflict saw ethnic violence between members of Kiir's Dinka community and the Nuers who were seen as backing Machar.

Nigerian officers to face trial over coup-plot allegations,2026-01-26T19:07:08.164Z," Chris Ewokor
BBC Africa
Abuja
","A group of officers in Nigeria are set to face a military court after being accused of ""plotting to overthrow the government"" of President Bola Tinubu last year, an armed forces' statement has said.
Sixteen officers were arrested last October after what were described as ""acts of indiscipline and breaches of service regulations"".
At the time the military dismissed rumours of an attempted coup, but following an investigation, the authorities have acknowledged that some of the 16 will go before a military judicial panel.
Nigeria has a complex history of military involvement in politics, with multiple coups between 1966 and 1993, which has made allegations of coup‑plotting highly sensitive.
It is not clear how many of the 16 will go on trial, but the military authorities said the process would ensure accountability and uphold ""the principles of fairness and due process"".
A statement added that trying to unseat the elected government was ""inconsistent with the ethics, values and professional standards"" of the military.
In recent years, concerns over instability, insecurity and public frustration have occasionally prompted rumours about dissent within the ranks - rumours the military has repeatedly dismissed.
Nigeria has experienced a period of unbroken civilian rule since 1999. The armed forces have consistently stressed their loyalty to civilian authority, often issuing public statements reaffirming their commitment to democracy.
This latest development comes at a time when the West African region has experienced a resurgence of coups. Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Guinea have all seen their governments toppled by soldiers since the beginning of the decade. However, Guinea recently returned to a democratic rule with the junta leader, Mamadi Doumbouya elected president.
These events have created heightened vigilance among governments in the region, including Nigeria, which has traditionally positioned itself as a stabilising force within the regional grouping Ecowas.
Within Nigeria, the military continues to face intense operational pressures - from fighting militant jihadist groups in the north-east to tackling criminals and communal violence across the north‑west and central states.
Analysts say such pressures, combined with resource constraints and public scrutiny, have put the spotlight on discipline within the armed forces.

Kenyan cult leader faces charges over 52 further deaths,2026-01-26T18:10:40.513Z," Jean Otalor
","The leader of a Kenyan cult accused of encouraging his followers to starve themselves to death will be charged over a further 52 deaths at another village, prosecutors say.
Self-proclaimed pastor Paul Mackenzie was arrested in 2023 after 429 bodies, including children, were dug up from mass graves in the remote Shakahola forest.
He has been in custody since his arrest and has been accused of luring the latest victims to their deaths by writing notes from his prison cell.
Mackenzie has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of manslaughter.
The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said in a statement on X on Monday that it had received the go-ahead to ""formally charge Good News International Church leader Paul Nthenge Mackenzie and his co-accused over the deaths of 52 people at the Binzaro homestead in Kilifi County"".
Mackenzie was ""reasonably suspected to have masterminded"" the incidents and had used ""radical teachings and coordinated structures to lure victims"" to the remote village, the prosecutors said.
""Investigators recovered handwritten notes from [prison] cells occupied by Mackenzie, allegedly detailing transactions conducted through mobile phones,"" it added.
Mackenzie and others will be charged with various offences, including radicalisation, ""facilitation of terrorist acts"", and murder over the more recent killings, in addition to the initial charges related to the mass graves found in the forest of Shakahola, prosecutors said.
Last year, around 34 bodies and more than 100 body parts were discovered by investigators in Binzaro, around 30 km (20 miles) from Shakahola along the Indian Ocean coast. This is what has led to the latest charges.
They come two weeks after one of Mackenzie's co-accused and the former head of security at Shakahola, Enos Amanya Ngala, pleaded guilty to charges related to the deaths of 191 children found in the original mass graves.
Survivors say children were supposed to be the first to starve themselves, according to a macabre order drawn up by Mackenzie. Then the unmarried, women, men, and last of all, church leaders.
Mackenzie set up his Good News International Church in 2003, but said he had closed it in 2019.
He encouraged his followers to move to Shakahola forest and prepare for the end of the world to ""meet Jesus"".
Mackenzie preached that formal education was satanic and used to extort money.
In 2017 and again in 2018, he was arrested for encouraging children not to go to school as he claimed education was ""not recognised in the Bible"".
The authorities have faced criticism after the discovery of the mass grave, with accusations that the deaths could have been prevented had there been tougher regulations.

Kenya's ex-deputy president alleges assassination attempt in church attack,2026-01-26T12:58:29.310Z," Alfred Lasteck
BBC AfricaandLucy Fleming
","Prominent Kenyan opposition figure Rigathi Gachagua has alleged there was an attempt on his life during a Sunday church service.
Gachagua, who was sacked as deputy president in an impeachment trial in 2024, claimed in an interview with the BBC that rogue police officers ""shot at everybody and tear-gassed the church"" in Othaya in the central county of Nyeri.
He had previously accused his former ally President William Ruto of ordering the attack but did not provide any evidence. Ruto has not commented but government spokesperson Isaac Mwaura accused Gachagua of staging the attack.
The police said an investigation had been launched, adding that no injuries had been reported.
Reports to the police indicated that a tear-gas canister had been thrown inside St Peters Anglican Church at 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT) disrupting the service.
Several vehicles were reportedly damaged within the church compound, the police added, appealing for witnesses.
Gachagua, a wealthy businessman from the central Mount Kenya area and now a vocal critic of the president, said he was escorted to safety by his security team.
He had posted photos of the incident on X and alleged to the BBC's Newsday programme that ""armed police officers with AK47s and tear gas descended on the church"".
Gachagua said that after he was helped to safety, the attackers set his car on fire and ""mercilessly"" beat up those gathered outside the church.
The Democracy for the Citizens Party leader said he has not reported the incident to the relevant authorities ""because it is the police who attacked us. You cannot report the police to the police"".
On Monday, government spokesperson Isaac Mwaura said Gachagua had orchestrated the attack himself.
""Those are staged-managed attacks to seek public sympathy and to whip up emotions,"" Mwaura told the BBC.
In an earlier press conference, Gachagua dismissed these allegations, asking: ""Where can we get access to tear gas?... Where do we get access to AK-47 assault rifles?""
Murkomen said the police chief had promised him that the attackers would be brought to justice.
""Violence anywhere, and least of all in a place of worship, is unacceptable,"" the interior minister said in a post on X.
""The police must move without fear or favour and deal decisively with the sponsors and perpetrators of this act without regard to their status in society or political affiliation.""
According to Kenya's constitution, Gachagua's conviction by the senate means he cannot hold public office again.
He had pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of which he was found guilty of five, including inciting ethnic divisions and violating his oath of office.
However the politician, popularly known as Riggy G, maintains he will be on the presidential ballot next year as he is appealing and the Supreme Court has not ruled on his impeachment.
Ruto and Gachagua were elected on a joint ticket in 2022 - and the partnership helped Ruto win by marshalling support in Mount Kenya, the heartland of the Kikuyu people who are the largest voting bloc in Kenya.

Uganda's military chief denies army assaulted Bobi Wine's wife,2026-01-26T10:31:33.382Z," Basillioh Rukanga
","Uganda's military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba has denied claims that soldiers assaulted Barbara Kyagulanyi, the wife of opposition leader Bobi Wine, during a raid at their home.
Wine, who is in hiding, alleged on Saturday that his wife was held at gunpoint by military officers who assaulted her, taking away documents and electronic items. He said the house continued to be surrounded by the military.
Speaking from hospital, Barbara Kyagulanyi said the officers had demanded to know Wine's whereabouts and had assaulted her when she refused.
It comes after the recent landslide victory of long-serving leader, and Kainerugaba's father, President Yoweri Museveni. Wine rejected the results citing fraud.
On Monday, the general posted on X that ""my soldiers did not beat up Barbie [Bobi Wine's] wife"".
""First of all, we do not beat up women. They are not worth our time. We are looking for her cowardly husband not her,"" he said.
Since Museveni was announced the winner of the 15 January election, the military chief has demanded Wine's surrender and has issued death threats against him.
Wine said on Monday that Kainerugaba was still looking for him ""and issuing threats to harm me"" and thanked the people for continuing to keep him safe.
""My wife is still recovering from the trauma of an overnight raid and assault... My home is still surrounded by the military,"" he added in a post on X.
From her hospital bed, Barbara Kyagulanyi had described how dozens of men had broken into her house, some in military uniform, harassing and assaulting her.
She said one of the men ""hit me on the face and tore my lip"". She said the officer had lifted her from behind by the waistband of her trousers while another choked her as she hung mid-air.
She said the first officer pulled off her blouse, leaving her partially naked, though it was later given back.
She said the officer also pulled her hair and ""hit me on the face and tore my lip"".
Barbara Kyagulanyi said she passed out after the ordeal. According to Wine, she was taken to hospital ""with both physical and psychological trauma"".
Since the election, the opposition has alleged that its supporters have been targeted by the security forces.
Kainerugaba said on Friday that security officers had killed 30 supporters of the opposition National Unity Party (NUP) led by Wine and detained 2,000 others.
Lawmaker Muwanga Kivumbi, who is a close Wine ally, was arrested for his alleged role in election-related violence last week, which the party denied.
The Uganda Law Society denounced the ""ongoing wave of detentions, torture and enforced disappearance"" of opposition leaders and supporters"".
""No-one should be subjected to violence by security forces under the pretext of national security,"" the society said on Sunday.
Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence.
Museveni first came to office as a rebel leader in 1986 and will have served for 45 years when the next term ends in 2031.

People cling to treetops as 'worst floods in a generation' sweep Mozambique,2026-01-25T18:48:27.790Z," Jose Tembe
Marracuene
","Tens of thousands of people in Mozambique are being rescued as rising waters continue to devastate the southern African nation - the worst flooding in a generation.
Teams from Brazil, South Africa and the UK have been helping with life-saving rescue operations.
""For me, this is the first time I have experienced a calamity of this magnitude. Elders say a similar disaster took place in the 1990s,"" 24-year-old mechanic Tomaz Antonio Mlau says.
Mlau and his family, who live near Marracuene - a town 30km (19 miles) north of the capital, Maputo - woke up to find their house inundated after the Inkomati River burst its banks.
""When a rescue boat came a few hours afterwards, we did not hesitate to board it and come to safety in Marracuene town,"" he said, adding they had to abandon all their belongings and only managed to bring a change of clothes.
Mlau, his wife and two children have found refuge at one of six centres - schools and churches - that are so far sheltering about 4,000 people.
Many of those gathered at Gwazamutini Secondary School are farmers from the low-lying areas with livestock and rice fields.
""We lost everything in the floodwaters, including houses, TV sets, fridges, clothing and livestock - cattle, goats and pigs. Our farms are under water. I am a farmer. I grow quality rice,"" 67-year-old Francisco Fernando Chivindzi told me.
His home is in Hobjana, one of several flooded neighbourhoods between the left bank of the Incomati River and the coastal tourism resort of Macaneta. Marracuene town is on the river's right bank.
""The floodwaters reached heights we weren't expecting. We have never experienced this level of flooding in my lifetime,"" Chivindzi said.
""We are happy to be here on higher ground. However, we are very worried that all our belongings were left behind.""
The farmer expressed his gratitude to the boat owners who came to assist him and his neighbours free of charge - and he urged others to save themselves.
""We hear that there are still some people resisting - clinging to treetops and on roofs. I wish they would heed the rescuers and join us here in this temporary shelter. We should value life more than the goods,"" the father of nine said.
This was a view echoed by Shafee Sidat, the mayor of the Marracuene municipality, as he visited Gwazamutini Secondary School on Saturday.
""We still have people to rescue, some of whom refuse to abandon the risk areas. That's a challenge. We reckon that more than 10,000 people are affected in Marracuene as a whole,"" he told me.
At least 642,122 people have been affected since 7 January by flooding - particularly in southern and central regions, with 12 deaths recorded so far, according to provisional data from the National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction.
In total 125 people have died in Mozambique since the rainy season began in October.
Mayor Sidat fears the situation is likely to get worse because of heavy rain in neighbouring South Africa, the source of the Inkomati River.
""We are worried about discharges of a South African dam on the Inkomati River. Our town is the last one downstream,"" the mayor said.
""Before the waters flow into the Indian Ocean, they flood the 'machambas' (farmlands), homes and grazing areas here in the low-lying zones.""
Some aerial views show water as far as the eye can see. Hundreds of families remain cut off.
All vehicles have now been banned from roads between the provinces of Maputo and Gaza to the north.
Transport Minister João Matlombe said it was because main roads, in particular the N1 highway which runs the whole length of the country and is the only link to the north, were flooded.
The suspension is already leading to shortages and price hikes, including of basic foodstuffs, coconut and fuel - even as far away as the north-western city of Tete, more than 1,500km from Maputo.
For those at shelters in Marracuene, food is also a challenge.
""There isn't yet enough food to eat,"" said Aninha Vicente Mivinga, whose two children are aged two and five.
""On the first day this Friday, there was almost nothing to eat. It was painful to see children sleeping without anything to eat, except biscuits. Today things improved,"" she said.
Mivinga, who is a police officer and farms in her spare time, described how she was at work in Marracuene town when the floods hit at her home in Hobjana.
The 32-year-old had taken the precaution of taking her children to stay with family members who lived on higher ground because of the continuous rain, but even they were affected by the rising waters.
""To learn that my children and other members of the family were on floodwaters and at risk of dying was horrific. I was devastated and completely shaken,"" the officer said.
""Eventually my relatives were brought to safety.
""It is the first time since I was born that we've been affected by flooding of this dimension.""
Mivinga said that students were meant to resume classes soon - and she would like the authorities to find permanent alternative accommodation for them.
Hundreds of people are currently camping down in the classrooms using a traditional wrap cloth as bedding on which to lie down.
""When floodwaters subside, I believe everyone would love to go back home, but it's too risky. If only the authorities could give us another place on safer ground. We would go back to the risky area only for farming purposes but live on safer ground,"" the police officer said.
Education Minister Samaria Tovela has already hinted that the cabinet is to consider rescheduling the start of the 2026 academic year, originally planned to begin next week, ""to allow flood victims to continue using them as accommodation centres, especially in the provinces of Maputo and Gaza, the most affected at the moment"".
Chivindzi, who is not sure that the floodwaters will recede before schools resume, is determined to return home.
""We'll restart life from scratch,"" the farmer says.
Mlau, who is unable to get to the garage where he works, is less sure of the future and the risks of starting again in the same place.
""Even if waters subside, I am not sure I'll go back there.""

'Half of my friends were killed' - the girls returning to a school caught up in war,2026-01-24T00:03:52.131Z," Mohamed Mohamed Osman
BBC World Service
El-Obeid
Sudan
","It had been a normal day for 18-year-old twins Makarem and Ikram when their school came under fire.
Makarem was in an English literature class and Ikram was in a science lesson when they heard ""strange sounds"" coming from outside the school in Sudan.
Then the shelling started.
Makarem says her shoulder ""tilted"" as she was struck. Screaming, her classmates dropped to the floor to avoid shellfire and find somewhere to hide.
""We took cover beside the wall and the girl who was standing in front of me put her hand on my shoulder and said: 'Your shoulder is bleeding.'""
In the chaos, the two sisters, who had been in separate classrooms, tried to reach each other but couldn't. Later, Ikram searched for her sister, not knowing she'd already been taken to hospital.
Like others who were injured, Makarem was taken to hospital by local residents who drove the wounded by car and animal-drawn carts because there was no ambulance service in el-Obeid, the city where they lived.
Eventually, her teachers and classmates had to convince Ikram to abandon the search and go home.
It was only when Makarem returned home from hospital later that day that her family found out she was still alive.
""I waited for her outside the front door and when I saw her coming we all cried,"" says Ikram, who had been in a part of the school that wasn't hit, so was unharmed.
Makarem and Ikram's English teacher and 13 classmates were killed and dozens more injured in the shelling at the Abu Sitta girls' school, in el-Obeid, in North Kordofan state, in August 2024. The school normally has about 300 students.
Regional authorities accuse the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - the paramilitary group at war with the Sudanese army - of firing the shells.
The RSF has never commented on the incident and did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. It is not clear whether the shelling of the school was intentional.
Makarem says half of her friends at school were killed while the other half were injured.
As well as injuring her shoulder, she also suffered a head wound, but was discharged from hospital having received basic treatment.
But several days later, after developing severe headaches, she was given a CT scan which found a small piece of shrapnel in her head.
""It hurt very much and I had to take many painkillers,"" she says.
Sudan's civil war began in April 2023 and has resulted in the deaths of more than 150,000 people, with millions forced from their homes.
The United Nations says the country is now enduring the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
Sudan's oil-rich Kordofan region - which is divided into North, South and West Kordofan states - has become a major front line in the war due to its strategic significance, sitting between RSF-controlled areas in the west and eastern areas where the army is mostly in charge.
Analysts say whoever controls the region effectively controls the country's oil supply, as well as a large chunk of the country.
An estimated 13 million of the 17 million school-age children who have remained in Sudan are out of school, according to the UN.
North Darfur, under RSF control, is the worst affected state, according to the charity Save the Children, with just 3% of its schools open.
The Abu Sitta school was closed for three months after the attack while it was renovated.
Makarem and Ikram said initially they could not imagine returning to the place where their friends and teacher had been killed.
""But when I saw my friends returning and telling me that things were OK, I decided to return,"" says Ikram.
Even so, returning to school brought back painful memories.
""I used to close my eyes on the way to class to avoid looking at the area where the shelling happened,"" Ikram says.
A number of students were given psychological support at the school when they returned, says headteacher Iman Ahmed.
Beds and nurses were also made available at the school to allow injured students to take their exams in comfort.
Although el-Obeid is still being subjected to repeated drone attacks, students at the school were playing and laughing in the courtyard when the BBC visited in December.
The headteacher describes the girls' determination to continue their studies, despite what happened to them, ""as a form of defiance and loyalty to those who were lost"".
But the situation for children trying to learn in el-Obeid remains challenging.
The city lived under a siege by the RSF for more than a year and a half, until the Sudanese army regained control in February 2025.
While there is now relative calm, dozens of schools have been converted into shelters for people fleeing the war.
El-Obeid hosts nearly one million displaced people across various shelters, according to the state's humanitarian aid commissioner.
Ibtisam Ali, a student at a secondary school that has been converted, says she cannot leave her classroom until the end of the school day because the grounds are full of displaced people.
""Even going to the bathroom has become a problem for us,"" she says.
Walid Mohamed Al-Hassan, the minister of education in North Kordofan state, said the presence of displaced families in schools had caused problems - including with sanitation - but that these are ""the conditions of war and the cost of war"".
In spite of the war and everything that has happened, Makarem and Ikram, who are now 19, are hopeful about their futures.
Ikram completed her studies at school and is now studying English at university in el-Obeid.
She was inspired by her English teacher, Fathiya Khalil Ibrahiem, who was killed in the attack.
The death of her friends made her even more determined to complete her studies, she says.
""I kept reminding myself that we should carry the same ambition to achieve what they were unable to achieve.""
Makarem, meanwhile, wants to become a doctor like those who treated her after she was injured.
She passed her secondary school exams but did not achieve the score required to be admitted to study medicine at university.
Makarem says the shrapnel lodged in her head, which cannot be removed surgically, made it hard for her to study at first.
""I could only study for an hour and then rest for another hour. It was very difficult.""
Dr Tarek Zobier, a neurologist in Sudan, said the medical implications of having shrapnel lodged in the head vary from case to case.
Some people will experience no symptoms and can live without medical intervention.
But if more severe symptoms, such as spasms, are experienced, surgery may be required.
For Makarem, the pain is no longer consistent, although it gets worse in winter when it's cold. She relies on painkillers when needed.
She's decided to repeat her school year so she can retake her exams.
""I believe that I will be able to achieve the score I am aiming for.
""I am hopeful for the future,"" she says.

South Sudan army chief gives soldiers seven days to crush rebellion,2026-01-23T13:53:29.526Z," Nichola Mandil
Juba
","The head of South Sudan's armed forces has given soldiers seven days to ""crush the rebellion"" in the east that is a potential threat to the capital, Juba.
Recently, the Sudan People's Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA-IO) has attacked and captured several areas in Jonglei state, a local journalist told the BBC, though this could not be independently verified. The latest fighting has threatened Jonglei's capital, Bor, three hours' drive from Juba.
SPLA-IO's leader, suspended First Vice-President Riek Machar, is currently on trial on charges of murder, treason and crimes against humanity, which he denies.
There are fears that the fighting could re-ignite a full-blown civil war in the country.
Conflict in South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, broke out in 2013, two years after independence, when President Salva Kiir accused Machar of plotting to overthrow him.
A 2018 peace deal ended the civil war that had killed nearly 400,000 people, but it has never been properly implemented and the relationship between Kiir and Machar has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.
Reinforcements from the South Sudanese army have now been deployed to Bor, which was the first place to be captured by opposition forces in the 2013-2018 conflict. The town is seen as a strategic staging post on the way to the capital.
""We brought you here for a mission,"" chief of the defence force Gen Paul Nang Majok told his troops.
""I am giving you seven days only to finish the mission – to crush the rebellion in those areas and recapture them.""
The South Sudanese army is being supported by soldiers from Uganda. Their exact number is not known. One report put the figure at 4,000, but this has not been confirmed.
The soldiers are now preparing to advance into the areas held by SPLA-IO forces, national broadcaster SSBC has reported.
Analysts believe the threats by the SPLA-IO forces to advance towards Juba with the aim of occupying it are meant to put pressure on the government to release Machar.
Earlier this week, Kiir sacked Machar's wife, Angelina Teny, from her position as interior minister in the unity government and replaced her with someone from his own party. The move sparked criticism and worries that it could escalate the conflict.
The UN's peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Jonglei and other areas experiencing violence in the country.
Unmiss acting head of mission Kiki Gbeho urged the leaders of South Sudan to commit to ""immediately ceasing hostilities, de-escalating tensions, and advancing reconciliation and peace through inclusive dialogue under the framework of the peace agreement"".
The UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan also expressed alarm at the deteriorating political and security situation and had a similar message to Unmiss.
Commission chair Yasmin Sooka expressed deep alarm at the reports of repeated airstrikes in parts of Jonglei, which have killed and injured civilians, destroyed homes, markets and medical facilities, and triggered large-scale displacement.
Earlier this month, SPLA-IO acting chief of staff, Lt Gen Peter Thok Chuol Luak, issued a warning to Juba's residents, saying its forces would launch attacks near the city.
""This warning precedes imminent military confrontations in Juba. We strongly recommend that all South Sudanese citizens in areas on the outskirts of Juba either evacuate or remain indoors,"" Gen Thok wrote.
The governor of the state that includes Juba, Emmanuel Adil Anthony, has urged residents to ignore the threats made by the SPLA-IO.

"Mandela's prison key, sunglasses and shirt can be sold after daughter wins court battle",2026-01-23T12:16:21.454Z," Mayeni Jones
Johannesburg
","A South African court has dismissed an appeal by the country's heritage body to stop the sale and export of various artefacts connected to anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela.
The 70 personal items include a cell key from Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 of the 27 years he was locked up, a pair of Aviator sunglasses and one of his signature floral shirts. They were due to be exported to the US for auction.
The objects belong to his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela and Christo Brand, a Robben Island warden during Mandela's incarceration.
In trying to stop their sale, the authorities said they were part of the country's heritage and were therefore legally protected from export.
The South African Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra) first found out about the potential sale in a British newspaper article from late 2021, claiming that the key would go for more than £1m ($1.35m).
The agency then wrote to the US auction house, Guernsey, that was planning the sale to ask it to suspend the auction and return the assets to South Africa.
Other items in the lot were a copy of the 1996 South African Constitution personally signed by Mandela, one of his charcoal drawings, an ID card, a tennis racquet he used on Robben Island and gifts from world leaders, including one from former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.
Mandela's daughter wanted to use the proceeds from the sale to build a memorial garden at the late former president's grave in Qunu, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape province.
In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Appeal argued that Sahra's interpretation of what items fell under the National Heritage Resources Act was overly broad.
The ruling also states that whereas Makaziwe and Brand explained in detail why their respective assets were not heritage objects, Sahra made no attempt to explain on what grounds it believed they were.
It is not yet clear whether the authorities will seek other legal avenues to block the sale. The BBC has contacted the sport, arts and culture department for comment.
Makaziwe, Mandela's only daughter with his first wife, welcomed the Supreme Court's judgment, blasting the heritage agency for presuming ""to know my father's last wishes better than those who were beside him at the end - his family"".
""Nobody is more invested in ensuring Tata's [Mandela's] legacy endures in the way he would want to be remembered than those who carry his name,"" she said.
She added that no decision had yet been made on what would happen to the items meant to go on auction.
Some supporters of the government's position argued that items connected to Mandela should not be sold or exported but instead kept in South Africa for future generations.
Others believe that Mandela's family should decide what happens to the objects.
Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He led the African National Congress in its struggle against apartheid - a system of legally enforced racism - and was released from prison in 1990.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with then-President FW de Klerk.
Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994.

'Blood was all over' - victim of Nigeria church abduction describes escape,2026-01-23T00:20:27.550Z," Madina Maishanu
BBC Africa
Kurmin Wali
","There was a huge plaster on Sarah Peter's head to staunch the bleeding caused by the blow of a gunman's weapon.
Sarah, not her real name, was in church in a village in northern Nigeria on Sunday morning when attackers raided the compound to abduct the worshippers and take them away on foot.
The 60-year-old was whacked on the skull with a rifle to encourage her to move.
""Blood was all over,"" she said, her fingers brushing the area where the wound was.
""I suffered,"" she added, clearly still traumatised by what happened three days earlier.
""They kept dragging me even when I told them I couldn't walk. Then I hid somewhere until I couldn't see them any more. I was so weak I had to crawl back to the village.""
Dozens of others were taken away from her branch of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church and two other churches in Kurmin Wali, a village 135km (84 miles) north of the capital, Abuja.
Although 11 people managed to escape, including Sarah, more than 160 people are still unaccounted for, according to the local branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria.
The remaining villagers have been left devastated and fear more attacks.
Authorities have not released any figures for those missing.
Kurmin Wali is near Kaduna state's Rijana forest, a hideout for armed gangs, known here as ""bandits"", who have been carrying out raids and abductions in the region.
No group has said it was behind Sunday's raid, but the attack is part of a wider security crisis in Nigeria, with kidnapping for ransom becoming more common.
Paying kidnappers is illegal in Nigeria but it is often suspected that money has been handed over to free those who have been abducted. In this case, no ransom demand has been reported.
There has been an increasing international focus on the issue after US President Donald Trump alleged last year that Christians were being targeted and killed in record numbers. Last month, the US military carried out air strikes on camps of suspected Islamist militants in Nigeria's north-west.
Nigerian officials have denied that Christians were being singled out because of their faith, and have said Muslims, Christians and those with no religion have all been affected by the insecurity.
There is an air of tension and anger in Kurmin Wali.
The village head said people had been living in fear for a while. Local residents have been urging authorities to improve security and have accused them of trying to suppress information in the wake of Sunday's raid.
Forty-eight hours of confusion followed the attack as officials initially denied anything had happened, despite eyewitness reports, only to finally confirm events on Tuesday evening.
""They told us not to give out any information, they want to intimidate us but we must tell our story. They have also been stopping some journalists from coming to the town,"" said a young man in his 20s, who wished to remain anonymous.
It is not clear why the authorities may have been reluctant for news to get out, but Kaduna state governor Uba Sani told the BBC that officials wanted to confirm details first before making any statements.
However, that does not explain why the local police chief and a state official initially denied there had been any attack, describing the reports as a ""mere falsehood which is being peddled by conflict entrepreneurs who want to cause chaos"".
The BBC also faced difficulties reaching Kurmin Wali, after a politician and security personnel attempted to block access to the village.
But we managed to get through and once inside, we found a scene of chaos in the building of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church. Colourful plastic chairs were on their sides, prayer books scattered on the floor and musical instruments broken, as if the moment after the attack had been frozen in time.
Nearby, Christopher Yohanna was looking forlornly at his two-year-old daughter. He said he managed to escape from the attackers with his child.
""We were in the church when we heard shouting. When we came out and tried to run, we saw that gunmen had already surrounded the village.""
He was lucky not to be caught, but he is devastated because his two wives and other children were not so lucky.
""If my family is not with me then my life is worthless and free of any joy,"" he said.
Governor Sani was in Kurmin Wali three days after the attack, pledging to establish a military base, a hospital and a road in the area. He also announced relief measures for affected residents, including medical support.
""We cannot relocate them because they have to farm… but to ensure that we protect them going forward, we need to have a military base around that area between that village and Rijana forest,"" he told the BBC.
He also said efforts were under way to work with security agencies to rescue those still in captivity.
""When we met [the villagers] I affirmed that we are with them and… we will not let any of them down.""
As the residents of Kurmin Wali wait anxiously for the return of their family members, they are hoping the governor keeps to his word.

Ugandan MP and Bobi Wine ally arrested over election violence,2026-01-22T13:14:04.061Z," Basillioh Rukanga
","Ugandan police have detained a lawmaker, and close ally of opposition leader Bobi Wine, for his alleged role in election-related violence last week.
Muwanga Kivumbi, a deputy leader of Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), is accused of organising attacks on a police station and a vote-tallying centre after their electoral loss, which the party denies.
The police have said that seven people were killed in the incident, but the politician has given a different account, saying that 10 people were killed at his home as they waited for parliamentary election results.
The Uganda Police Force said in a post on X on Thursday that Kivumbi would be ""arraigned before court in due course"".
""His arrest is in connection with recent incidents of political violence,"" it added.
Kivumbi's arrest follows tensions after last week's elections in which President Yoweri Museveni was re-elected for a seventh term.
During his victory speech over the weekend, Museveni warned opposition figures including Kivumbi of coordinated plans to attack polling stations.
He said seven people were shot dead by police after groups of alleged opposition supporters, armed with machetes, attempted to carry out violent attacks in Butambala district outside the capital, Kampala.
Wine, Museveni's closest challenger and who is in hiding after fleeing a raid on his house after the elections, has denounced the results as ""fake"", citing electoral fraud.
He has also alleged that there was ""silent massacre"" under way and a crackdown targeting political activists.
On Tuesday, he posted on social media that more than 100 people had been killed in election violence, without stating evidence.
This came after Uganda's army chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also Museveni's son and his potential successor, said the security forces had killed 22 opposition supporters during poll-related violence.
Since the election, Ugandan authorities have reportedly arrested dozens of youths on various charges linked to election-related incidents in Kampala.
Museveni first came to power as a rebel leader in 1986. He will have served for 45 years when the next term ends in 2031.
Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence.

Bobi Wine tells the BBC from hiding he will not contest Uganda election results in court,2026-01-22T11:38:30.066Z," Catherine ByaruhangaandWycliffe Muia
","Uganda's opposition leader Bobi Wine has told the BBC he will not contest the results of Thursday's election in court, citing a lack of confidence in the judiciary and has instead urged his supporters to take to the streets to peacefully protest.
Speaking to the BBC from hiding, he said he would continue to stand up to President Yoweri Museveni despite concerns for his safety.
""The judiciary in Uganda is captured and we encourage Ugandans to use any legal means to fight back and protect their democracy,"" the 43-year-old former pop star said.
Museveni, 81, won the vote by a landslide and has accused the opposition of seeking to overturn the results through violence, calling them ""terrorists"".
He gained 72% of the vote while Wine, his closest challenger, got 25%.
Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, maintains the results are ""fake"" and has cited ""ballot stuffing"" without providing any details.
During his interview, Wine also hit out at the security forces for not allowing food into his family home where his wife and relatives are effectively under house arrest. He says he fled the house, in a suburb of the capital, Kampala, on Friday night during a raid by the security forces.
""We reject those results because they are fake and they don't in any way reflect the voting pattern. They are completely different from the results in the electoral on the polling stations and on the declaration forms,"" Wine told the BBC, speaking from an undisclosed location.
The authorities have not responded to his allegations, but the Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC) said the ""technical and procedural"" challenges observed on polling day did not undermine the overall fairness of the vote.
In their report, the African Union (AU) election observers said they saw ""no evidence of ballot stuffing"", but condemned days-long internet shutdown - which only returned hours after President Museveni was declared the winner on Saturday.
After losing to Museveni in 2021, Wine challenged the results but later withdrew the petition, citing what he called the court's bias and lack of impartiality.
Wine, who has lost his presidential bid for a second time, also alleged there was an ongoing ""silent massacre"" as political activists were targeted in a crackdown.
In a social media post he said more than 100 people had been killed in election violence - without stating evidence.
More than 100 youths have been remanded in prison on various charges linked to election-related incidents across Kampala, the Daily Monitor newspaper reported.
In a post on X on Monday, Uganda's army chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also President Museveni's son and his potential successor, said the security forces had killed 22 opposition supporters during poll-related violence.
Gen Kainerugaba also threatened Wine, giving him ""exactly 48 hours to surrender himself to the police"".
""If he doesn't we will treat him as an outlaw/rebel and handle him accordingly,"" he said.
Those tweets - and one in which he threatened to remove the opposition leader's testicles - have since been deleted.
Wine later called him out on X and included a screengrab of some of the deleted tweets - to which Gen Kainerugaba responded on Thursday morning with the comment: ""Boo hoo hoo Mr. 24%.""
In his BBC interview, Wine said he fled his home after learning that security forces were planning to ""attack"" him.
""They jumped off my fence and cut off my electricity and the surveillance cameras. I saw it dangerous for me to stay around,"" said Wine, who has not been seen in public for days.
""You have heard Museveni's son promising to harm me. He has promised to harm people and... he has delivered to it. You have read his recent tweets. That's why I have to be careful with myself,"" he said.
Although the internet was restored late on Saturday, Wine said he was not able to reach his wife because of signal jammers near his home.
The police have denied raiding the opposition leader's home, saying the security deployment was to protect him as a presidential candidate.
Wine went on to call for a ""peaceful change"" of regime, saying protests were constitutional rights.
""We encourage Ugandans to evoke any constitutional means to fight back,"" he added.
On Tuesday, Donald Muhwezi, a local police chief in Kampala, told local media that police were not concerned about Wine's whereabouts, ""as long as he is safe"".
In his victory speech on Sunday, Museveni said his election win showed the dominance of his party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM).
Museveni first came to power as a rebel leader in 1986 but since then has won seven elections.
Uganda has not witnessed a peaceful transfer of presidential power since independence.

"Life of veteran Ugandan opposition leader in danger, wife says",2026-01-22T11:34:11.439Z," Wycliffe Muia
","The life of Uganda's veteran opposition figure Kizza Besigye is in danger, his wife has said after visiting him in prison.
''He is extremely weak,'' said Winnie Byanyima in a statement posted on X. The 69-year-old politician had been taken overnight to a medical facility, the People's Front for Freedom (PFF) party said, without specifying what he was suffering from.
A prison service spokesperson denied that Besigye's health was dire, describing his visit to a doctor as a ""general check-up"".
Besigye, a former personal doctor to President Yoweri Museveni and one of his longest-standing political rivals, has been in detention since November 2024.
''Dr Besigye told me he is finding it difficult to walk and is experiencing significant pain in his legs,'' said Byanyima, a respected human rights advocate and head of UNAids.
Byanyima described how she had found him ""huddled"" on a dirty plastic chair in a small room near his cell, where he has been returned after getting medical treatment overnight.
Speaking to the BBC's Newsday programme, Byanyima demanded the immediate release of her husband.
""Lab results showed that the infection has been increasing for the last two days. He is not well at all,"" she added.
Besigye, who has run for president against Museveni four times, has been in detention with his associate Obeid Lutale since they were both dramatically seized in Kenya and taken back to Uganda.
The PFF leader has been charged in a military court with treason, which carries the death sentence, as well as illegal possession of a firearm and threatening national security. He denies the accusations.
On Wednesday, a court rejected a request by Besigye's lawyers to transfer him to a medical facility of his choice. His trial was adjourned due to illness but the court said it had not seen evidence that his health concerns could not be managed in prison.
Last month, a court denied them bail for the fourth time, saying it was too early to release them as they had not yet entered their pleas.
In a statement on Tuesday, the PFF accused Ugandan authorities of denying Besigye proper medical care, noting that his continued detention amounted to a violation of his basic rights.
""It is a tragedy that a man who has dedicated his life to the health and freedom of others is being denied his own right to medical dignity,"" the PFF said, adding: ""We hold the regime and the prison authorities fully accountable for his well-being.""
The prison service spokesperson, denied that Besigye's health was critical, saying the opposition figure was under standard medical supervision.
""Kizza Besigye receives necessary treatment like other prisoners and he is fine,"" Baine said, adding: ""This morning he was doing his exercises.""
Byanyima described this statement as ""a cover-up"".
''Last night, after a sharp deterioration in his condition, he was rushed to the clinic of his personal doctor, where he was treated and then returned to prison late at night,'' she said, calling on the authorities to transfer him to a fully equipped hospital.
Another opposition leader, Bobi Wine, has expressed concern over Besigye's health while in detention, saying his condition appears to be deteriorating amid limited access to medical care.
""We stand fully in solidarity with him and pray for his recovery,"" Wine said in a post on X.
This is not the first time the veteran opposition leader has been taken ill at Luzira Prison, a maximum security jail in Kampala, where he has been held.
Last February, Besigye was also reported critically ill after he went on hunger strike demanding justice.
Besigye, who last contested the presidency in 2016, has previously accused the authorities of political persecution.
In recent years he has been less active in politics and did not contest the general election earlier this month.
There have been increasing calls by his family, opposition and human rights groups for him to be released on medical grounds.
President Museveni has blamed Besigye and his legal team for the delays in the trial, which he said had resulted in the PFF's leader's continued detention.
Museveni, who has held power since 1986, was on Saturday declared the winner of last week's presidential election with 72% of the vote.
His closest challenger Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, got 25%.
Wine rejected the results as ""fake"" and has gone into hiding citing threats against his life.

Guinea-Bissau coup leaders set December election date,2026-01-22T11:14:11.532Z," Paul Njie
BBC Africa
","Military authorities in coup-prone Guinea-Bissau have scheduled presidential and legislative elections for 6 December, despite calls for a swifter transition to civilian rule.
Transitional President Horta N'Tam signed a decree on Wednesday after meeting members of the National Transitional Council, military, and government officials, as well as representatives of the electoral commission.
He told reporters the conditions for free and fair elections had been met.
Since seizing power from President Umaro Sissoco Embaló in November, Guinea-Bissau's coup leaders have been under pressure from the West African regional body, Ecowas, to organise elections within a short transitional timeframe.
The regional bloc had previously rejected the junta's notion of a one-year timeline, suspended the country from its decision-making bodies, and threatened further sanctions.
It remains unclear how Ecowas will react to the election timetable now that it has been formally announced by the junta.
The November 2025 coup drew widespread criticism, with many challenging the military's decision to seize power on the eve of the official proclamation of presidential election results.
At the time, both President Embaló and his main challenger Fernando Dias claimed victory. The military said it intervened to thwart a plot to destabilise the politically fragile and unstable West African nation.
But some regional observers, including former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, argued the coup was staged.
Many now wait to discover the identities of those aspiring for the country's top job. The transitional charter adopted shortly after the coup already bars interim leader N'Tam and his prime minister from running.
But given the trend of coup leaders in West Africa consolidating power and extending their stay in office, observers will no doubt question whether Guinea-Bissau will be any exception.

"South African police not yet able to defeat gangs, minister says",2026-01-22T08:23:36.213Z," Wycliffe Muia
","South Africa's Police Minister Firoz Cachalia has said that the security forces are not yet able to defeat deadly criminal gangs, in a stark admission that underscores the scale of the country's crime crisis.
Gang violence, alongside robberies, accounts for many murders in South Africa, which has one of the world's highest homicide rates.
Cachalia said gang violence had become increasingly complex, especially in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, requiring new strategies beyond traditional policing.
""I do not believe that we are currently in a position to defeat these gangs,"" the minister told journalists on Wednesday.
South Africa, the continent's most industrialised nation, has long struggled with entrenched organised crime.
Many people in South Africa own licensed firearms for personal protection, but there are many more illegal guns in circulation.
Police data shows that an average of 63 people were killed each day between April and September last year.
Speaking after his visit to crime-infested Nelson Mandela Bay in Eastern Cape, Cachalia said criminal gangs were on a ""killing spree"" in the two provinces.
""We had a discussion about the problem of organised crime in the Eastern Cape, including extortion rackets, gang violence and related issues,"" said the minister.
""I indicated that this is a grave problem throughout the country, that these cartels wield significant wealth and power, and that this is deeply concerning,"" he added.
Despite the creation of an anti-gang unit in 2019, Cachalia said gangsters seemed to be winning the war.
""Establishing gang units from time to time is an ad hoc response to a growing problem. I really don't think that we should be approaching this matter in a point-scoring way.""
He said South African police were doing their best to fight the violence ""but the problem is a growing one. That is my view"".
His visit comes months after Nelson Mandela Bay was hit by a wave of killings.
A deadly spike in violence hit the area in the latter half of last year, leaving 118 people dead between August and December, a local prevention group said.
The violence has continued into the new year, with around 40 people killed across the region in January, local media reported.
There are about three million legally held firearms in South Africa, but there are at least the same number of unlicensed weapons in circulation in the country, which has a population of 63 million, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association.
Last month, 11 people were killed in a mass shooting linked to illegal mining turf wars near Johannesburg.
The shooting occurred just two weeks after another attack at the Saulsville Hostel in the capital Pretoria, where 11 people, including a three-year-old child, were killed.
In another incident last May, gunmen killed eight customers at a tavern in the south-eastern city of Durban.
President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised stronger law enforcement action and increased police deployment to tackle the gang violence in the country.

Slashed incomes and gamers go cold turkey: the fallout from Uganda's internet shutdown,2026-01-22T04:14:19.733Z," Sammy Awami
BBC Africa
Kampala
","Mobile money agent Mirembe Tracy laments that her business in Uganda's bustling capital Kampala was paralysed when the government shut the internet during last week's fiercely contested general election.
""All withdrawals were disconnected,"" she tells the BBC, adding that she gets nearly all of her income from withdrawal commissions.
Without it, her income dropped to zero.
""In one week I can earn up to 450,000 [Ugandan] shillings (£96; $130). That money is what I use to pay rent. Losing it was a total loss,"" she says.
For two days either side of the election, there was nothing she could do but stay at home - she could only sell prepaid airtime credit, which she says does not ""give a commission"".
Uganda's communications authority ordered the nationwide shutdown to ""ensure peace, protect national stability and prevent the misuse of communication platforms during a sensitive national exercise"".
Th opposition said it was a move to cover up voter fraud and stop its agents from sharing the results from polling stations.
Either way, it brought many aspects of modern life to a halt.
Online businesses that rely on mobile money transactions were most affected by the blackout, with some coming to a standstill while others reverted to cash-based transactions.
Kampala is famous for its ubiquitous boda boda (motorcycle) taxis, with many operators earning their income through online ride-hailing apps.
The co-founder of SafeBoda told local media that the platform's entire server was down during the internet suspension, with many riders forced off the road and other businesses that depend on the service deprived of their income.
Namukwaya Olivia, who sells traditional cultural clothing and depends heavily on Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp to reach customers, says she did not make any deliveries during the period.
She tells the BBC that many of her customers ask for pictures before deciding on what to buy.
""We could not send pictures, we could not receive orders, and we could not make deliveries,"" the businesswoman says.
She adds that the effect of the shutdown was immediate, and made it difficult to cover basic costs.
""We couldn't pay rent during that period,"" she says. ""Even now, things have not fully recovered because customers still struggle to access us online.""
Journalist Ngabo Amon says his smartphone, a work tool for him, became largely useless.
""You have a phone, but there is nothing to do with it,"" he tells the BBC.
He could no longer research stories, follow election developments or send material to his newsroom.
He says everyday life transformed into anxious stretches of waiting for the internet to be restored.
Some households reverted to watching television to keep themselves occupied, either watching live, or buying downloaded old movies from shops.
""People bought what they could afford, went back home and just watched, because there were no other options,"" Ngabo says.
Some young people found it difficult to cope.
Ronnie Mwesigwa, 20, says he lost contact with friends and had no access to online entertainment.
""I couldn't communicate with anyone, and even gaming was gone,"" he says. ""It was not a good situation.""
To pass his time, the gamer turned to content already stored on his phone, only viewing his gallery.
""That was all I could do.""
Ngabo explains that the situation was especially frustrating for journalists covering the election, as the blackout made it impossible to get a real picture of what was unfolding on the ground.
""You are talking about people rioting, about tension on the streets, but the audience is only seeing your photo and hearing your voice, and it is not satisfying for the journalist or the viewer,"" he points out.
President Yoweri Museveni, 81, won the vote by a landslide to extend his 40-year-rule and has accused the opposition of seeking to overturn the results through violence.
Bobi Wine, his closest challenger maintains the results are ""fake"" and has cited ""ballot stuffing"".
According to a report by the African Union (AU) election observation mission, ""the internet shutdown limited access to information, freedom of association [and] curtailed economic activities"".
It also notes that the shutdown ""created suspicion and mistrust"" in the election process.
Ngabo says that the situation was worse in rural areas. With no internet access, some journalists were forced to physically transport their footage back to their newsrooms.
He gives an example of videos, made early on the morning of the elections in a remote rural area, reaching Kampala by bus in the evening.
""By that time, results are already being discussed and tallied and nobody is interested in the footage any more,"" he says.
Caroline Mutai, a Kenya-based journalist who went to Uganda to cover the elections, says the shutdown ""almost gave me depression"".
She describes the difficulties she faced trying to send back material to her newsroom, spending days searching for places with internet, only to be blocked or chased away.
The shutdown also cut her off from family at a time of heightened insecurity.
""When you are tired and stressed after work, you want to talk to people who are close to you,"" she says. ""But you cannot reach them, and that makes the situation even harder.""
For students, the blackout disrupted both communication and learning.
Aaron Benitez, a final-year school pupil, says he was unable to contact his family during a period of uncertainty.
""I needed to know what was happening with my family and what was going on in the country,"" he tells the BBC. ""But I could not connect with them at all.""
Online learning also came to a halt. Teachers could not send notes or assignments, and group discussions normally held online were cancelled.
""Our master could not send notes on WhatsApp,"" the student says. ""We usually study online, sometimes on Zoom, but during that time everything just stopped.""
He adds that access remains slow and unreliable, despite the election being over.
""It is back, but it is still very slow. Some materials cannot load properly, and that affects our studies.""
The government partially restored the internet after Museveni was declared the winner on Saturday.
Some platforms, especially social media, remain slow or restricted, pushing many young people to reconnect using a VPN (virtual private network), which can disguise its online location.
For many, the shutdown was not just a temporary inconvenience but a stark reminder of how deeply digital access shapes their everyday life.

Nigeria police confirm mass church abductions after previous denial,2026-01-21T13:08:20.185Z," Makuochi Okafor
BBC Africa
Lagos
","Nigeria's police have now confirmed that a group of worshippers was kidnapped from three churches in a remote part of the northern Kaduna state, after previously denying it.
More than two days after the raid on the Kurmin Wali village, police on Tuesday night said that an earlier statement denying the attack had been ""widely misinterpreted"".
Local residents told the BBC that 177 worshippers had been abducted but that 11 later escaped.
Police spokesperson Benjamin Hundeyin did not give any numbers but said subsequent checks by operational units and intelligence sources had confirmed the abduction.
He said security forces had been fully deployed to the area, and that search-and-rescue operations and patrols were under way.
The police spokesperson added that the earlier statement was ""not a denial of the incident but a measured response pending confirmation of details from the field, including the identities and number of those affected"".
One eyewitness said the attack happened at about 10:00 local time on Sunday.
""Some people tried to run, but they couldn't because the armed men had surrounded the village,"" he said. ""They gathered people together and later forced them to march into the bush.""
Residents said the attack affected three churches - two which are part of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, and one from the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA).
In a joint statement with local government officials on Monday, Kaduna state police commissioner Alhaji Muhammad Rabiu described the reports of a kidnapping as ""mere falsehood which is being peddled by conflict entrepreneurs who want to cause chaos"".
He challenged ""anyone to list the names of the kidnapped victims and other particulars.""
The chairman of Kajuru local government area, which includes Kurmin Wali, Dauda Madaki, said security forces had been sent to the area but found no sign of a kidnapping.
''We visited the church where the so-called kidnap took place. There was no evidence of the attack. I asked the village head, Mai Dan Zaria, and he said that there was no such attack.""
A list of those kidnapped seen by the BBC on Tuesday contains more than 160 names, though this has not been independently verified.
Amnesty International has criticised Nigeria's authorities over what it described as ""the desperate denial"" of the kidnapping.
The rights group said: ""Authorities must also take immediate and concrete measures to prevent rampant abductions that are gradually becoming the norm in Nigeria.""
In November, more than 300 students and teachers were seized from a Catholic school in neighbouring Niger state. They were later released in two successive groups. This was among a spate of kidnappings that made international headlines.
Nigeria is facing numerous security challenges - including kidnappings for ransom by criminal gangs, an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and a battle between herders and farmers in the centre over access to land and water.
Experts say corruption, poor intelligence sharing and underfunded local policing have hampered efforts to tackle the various crises.
Nigeria's defence minister resigned last month at the height of the kidnapping crisis, officially for health reasons, according to the president's office.
The US last month took military action in Nigeria - launching airstrikes on Christmas Day on two camps run by an Islamist militant group in north-western Nigeria.
US President Donald Trump has followed up by warning of more strikes if Christians continued to be killed in the West African nation.
There are more than 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria, which is roughly divided into a mainly Muslim north, a largely Christian south, with intermingling in the middle - and the government says people of all faiths have been victims of attacks.
A Nigerian foreign ministry spokesman responded to Trump's warning by saying that Nigeria would continue to engage constructively with partners such as the US.
''Nigeria remains committed to protecting all citizens, Christians and Muslims alike, without discrimination,'' Alkasim Abdulkadir said.

Malawi raises fuel prices by more than 40%,2026-01-20T17:10:17.317Z," Peter Jegwa
","Malawi's energy regulator has hiked petrol and diesel prices by more than 40%, marking the second time fuel costs gone up in four months.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (Mera) said the fixed pricing system of the previous government was ""unsustainable"" and had led to ""significant"" losses.
President Peter Mutharika, who returned to power last year, has been trying to revive Malawi's ailing economy.
However, local commentators said Tuesday's fuel increase could harm the president's efforts and worsen the cost-of-living crisis for many Malawians.
""Fuel is not a luxury commodity. Any increase has a cascading effect on the cost of living,"" the Human Rights Defenders Coalition, a Malawian civil society group, said.
In its statement, Mera said it was increasing diesel prices by 41.3% and petrol prices by 41.9%.
The hike means that since Mutharika came to power in October, the cost of petrol and diesel has gone up by 95% and 80% respectively.
Under previous President Lazarus Chakwera fuel shortages were a major source of public frustration, with motorists forming long, winding queues at depleted petrol stations. However, the supply has improved significantly over the past two months.
Mera said it is now operating under an ""automatic pricing mechanism"", where petrol and diesel prices change in line with the expenses involved in shipping the fuel.
In the wake of the announcement, sharp increases in transport fares have already been reported in most parts of the country. Prices of other key services and goods, such as food, are also expected to rise.
Commodity prices had already started to go up following the previous fuel hike, which was implemented in October, and this month's increase in the sales tax.
Mera's acting CEO Dad Chinthambi said the hike in fuel prices was necessary ""to ensure sustainable fuel supply, electricity services, and the proper remittance of levies to support road maintenance and rural electrification projects"".
The government is also trying to improve the government's finances and negotiate a new package of help from the International Monetary Fund.
Across social media and radio phone-in programmes, many Malawians voiced disappointment in Mera's decision, saying they expected Mutharika's administration to improve people's circumstances and not produce the same economic outcomes as the previous government.

Ex-president accused of murder plot expelled from Togo to Burkina Faso,2026-01-20T16:34:33.018Z," Chris Ewokor
BBC Africa
","Togo has arrested and extradited Burkina Faso's former leader to his home country, after authorities in Ouagadougou accused him of plotting to kill his successor.
Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba - who came to power in a coup in 2022 before himself being overthrown by Ibrahim Traoré eight months later - is accused by the current regime of masterminding an assassination attempt against Traoré.
According to the Togolese justice ministry, Damiba was handed over to the Burkinabè authorities on Saturday.
It says as part of the deal, Burkina Faso promised to ensure ""physical integrity, dignity and fair‑trial rights of Mr Paul‑Henri Sandaogo Damiba, and the absence of the death penalty"".
Among the charges levelled at Damiba by Burkina Faso's military government are ""criminal embezzlement of public funds, illicit enrichment, corruption, aggravated receiving of stolen goods and money laundering"", said Togo's justice ministry in a statement.
No comments from Damiba on the charges have been reported and neither have the BBC's calls to him been picked up.
Most serious are the murder plot allegations.
Earlier this month, Burkina Faso's Security Minister Mahamadou Sana announced on state television that security forces had foiled a planned series of targeted assassinations aimed at destabilising the state, including what he called the ""neutralisation"" of Traoré.
Officials in Ouagadougou have repeatedly accused Damiba of orchestrating plots from exile. In late 2024, he was again named publicly as the head of what authorities described as the ""military wing"" of a broader conspiracy.
Damiba first seized power in January 2022, toppling the elected government of Roch Marc Christian Kaboré amid frustration over the state's failure to curb Islamist violence.
But after just eight months, he was himself overthrown by Traoré, then a 34‑year‑old artillery officer who accused him of failing to deliver security improvements.
Since then, the Traoré-led junta has tightened its grip on the country, expelling French forces, adopting an assertive nationalist stance and recently reinstating the death penalty, including for crimes of high treason.
Despite promises to restore order, Burkina Faso remains mired in one of the world's most severe security crises, with militant jihadist attacks continuing across large parts of the country.
The return of Damiba to Burkina Faso, under arrest and possibly facing a long list of criminal charges, is expected to escalate tensions within the military and political establishment.
Political observers suggest that repeated accusations, foiled plots and widening divisions within the armed forces will likely lead to questions about the stability of a government still confronting both a brutal insurgency and internal rivalries.

Nigerian homicide police investigate death of singer Destiny Boy at 22,2026-01-20T14:38:54.743Z," Basillioh RukangaandMansur Abubakar
Abuja
","Police in Nigeria have made one arrest as they investigate the death at 22 of popular singer Destiny Boy, whose real name was Afeez Adesina.
Ogun state police's homicide section is dealing with the case, it said in a brief statement.
News of Destiny Boy's death emerged on Sunday, sparking shock and speculation on social media. It is not clear exactly what happened but his family reportedly said he had been suffering from a long-term illness. The body has since been buried in line with Muslim rites.
Destiny Boy was seen as a promising young Afrofuji artist, known for blending traditional Yoruba Fuji sounds with modern Afrobeats.
He came to national prominence after his 2019 version of popstar Davido's hit song If went viral on social media. He later recorded his own renditions of other popular songs as well as original tracks.
Following the young man's death, videos shared widely on social media showed what appeared to be his body being transported to a mortuary, triggering rumours about what may have led to his death.
Family members have said the singer had been living with a long-term illness, which they said caused him to have seizures.
In an online video, his mother, Saida, stated that the family had sought both medical and traditional treatment for the condition.
She said the illness ""had almost run him mad"", adding that relatives had to physically restrain him during seizures to prevent him from running out.
Nigerians online have been sending condolence messages, with some questioning the circumstances of his death.
On X, artist Ruger appeared to be complaining that there had been ""no autopsy"" and ""we just have to accept that he's dead. May God RIP Destiny Boy"".
The artist began his career as a backup dancer for Fuji musician Pasuma at T2 Boys Studios in Agege, a suburb of Lagos, before gaining wider attention in 2019.
His death comes about a year after the birth of his first child with his partner, Iremide, in November 2024.

US and Indonesia finalise deal to cut tariffs to 19%,2026-02-20T03:05:32.016Z," Osmond Chia
Business reporter
","President Donald Trump's administration and the Indonesian government say they have finalised an agreement to lower US tariffs on the South East Asian country to 19% from 32%.
Under the deal, Indonesia will cut trade barriers on more than 99% of US imports and facilitate more than $30bn (£22.3bn) of purchases of American goods, the White House said on Thursday.
Washington said it granted tariff exemptions on some Indonesian goods, including certain clothing and textiles that are produced with cotton and man-made materials from the US.
US trade representative Jamieson Greer said the agreement will ""breaks down trade barriers"" while advancing the interests of the American people.
The agreement came during a visit to Washington by Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto to attend the first meeting of the Trump-led ""Board of Peace"" to discuss the reconstruction of Gaza.
Indonesia's coordinating minister for economic affairs Airlangga Hartarto said the finalised deal is beneficial to both sides and will attract greater investment in Indonesia.
Airlangga said about 90% of Indonesia's requests on tariff terms were accepted by the US.
""The vision of this agreement is mutual economic prosperity, strong supply chains, and respect for each country's sovereignty,"" he told reporters in Washington.
Airlangga said that as part of the deal, Indonesia has secured tariff exemptions for more than 1,700 goods, including coffee, spices, chocolate, natural rubber and, notably, its top export product palm oil.
It comes in exchange for Indonesia opening up its markets to American products, such as by accepting US standards on car safety, emissions, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, said the White House.
Indonesia will lift trade barriers on American imports including agriculture, healthcare, seafood, technology and car-related products.
It has also committed to buy billions of dollars of US goods - including cotton, soy, beef, Boeing jets and energy.
Indonesia will facilitate US firms in developing the South East Asian country's rare earths infrastructure, which will help Washington expand its supply of critical minerals.
The deal will take effect in 90 days and changes could still be made to the terms if both countries agree, said Airlangga.
On Wednesday, Indonesian and US companies signed a slew of deals worth $38.4bn for partnerships in mining, technology, textiles and other industries.
Prabowo said the deals came as part of the tariff agreement and that it will help Indonesia to reduce its trade surplus with the US.
""I'm very optimistic about the future of our relationship,"" he said during a dinner hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday.

Woman accused of using ChatGPT to plan drug murders,2026-02-19T11:56:23.857Z," Inaya Mohmood
","A 21-year-old woman in South Korea has been charged with the murders of two men, after investigators discovered she had repeatedly asked ChatGPT about the dangers of mixing drugs with alcohol.
Police in Seoul say that through analysis of her mobile phone they found that the suspect, identified only by her surname Kim, had asked ChatGPT ""What happens if you take sleeping pills with alcohol?"", ""How many do you need to take for it to be dangerous?"", and ""Could it kill someone?""
Kim previously told police that she did mix prescribed sedatives containing benzodiazepines into the drinks but did not know the men would die.
However a police investigator said she was ""fully aware that consuming alcohol together with drugs could result in death.""
Kim was initially arrested on 11 February on the lesser charge of inflicting bodily injury resulting in death after two men died and another was left unconscious after going to a motel with her.
According to police, Kim's first alleged attack took place on 28 January when she entered a motel in Suyu-dong, Gangbuk-gu, with a man in his 20s, she left the motel alone two hours later and the man was found dead inside the room the following day.
Using the same method, she allegedly killed another man in his 20s on 9 February after the two checked into a different motel in Gangbuk-gu together.
However, officials said that the suspects first attempt at murder via drug misuse had occurred in December last year when she gave a drink mixed with sedatives to her partner at the time, in a cafe parking lot in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, causing him to lose consciousness.
According to police, after her first victim regained consciousness, Kim began to prepare her drinks with significantly higher doses of the drug.
Police have said they plan to continue investigating whether there are additional victims beyond the three identified.

South Korea's ex-president jailed for life over martial law attempt,2026-02-19T09:46:55.612Z," Jake Kwon
Seoul correspondentandKelly Ng
","South Korea's ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been jailed for life for masterminding an insurrection by trying to impose military rule.
Yoon attempted to subvert the constitution by deploying military troops to seal off the National Assembly and ordering the arrest of politicians on 3 December 2024, a Seoul court ruled. His actions fundamentally damaged South Korea's democracy and deserves a harsh punishment, presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon told the court.
Prosecutors had sought the death penalty.
Though it was short-lived, Yoon's martial law order left the nation more polarised than ever, and those deep divisions were on full display as the sentencing took place.
Huge crowds of Yoon's supporters gathered outside the court hours before the hearing, holding banners reading ""Yoon, again"". Many of them broke down in tears following the verdict.
Also present were anti-Yoon protesters, rallying for him to be sentenced to death.
Yoon himself showed no emotion as he learned of his fate. His lawyers alleged that the verdict was not backed by evidence and accused the judge of following a ""pre-written script"".
If either side launches an appeal, the case will go up to the Supreme Court, which means it could be months before the verdict is finalised.
Yoon shocked his nation on 3 December 2024 by declaring martial law on live television.
He claimed it was to protect the country from ""anti-state"" forces that sympathised with North Korea, but it soon became clear he was driven by domestic troubles: the opposition which held a parliamentary majority left him a lame duck president, while his wife Kim Keon Hee was at the centre of various corruption allegations.
He rolled back the order within hours, after lawmakers fought their way into the National Assembly to overturn it.
What followed were months of political chaos, Yoon's impeachment, and a string of indictments against him and other top officials.
Former prime minister Han Duck-soo was handed a 23-year jail term last month for his part in the insurrection, while ex-defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who advised Yoon to impose martial law, was jailed for 30 years on Thursday.
Former interior minister Lee Sang-min, former intelligence commander Roh Sang-won, and ex-police chief Cho Ji-ho were among the other officials jailed for what judges have described as ""an insurrection from the top"".
Security was tight outside the court on Thursday, with dozens of police buses forming a cordon to restrict public access. Some 1,000 officers were deployed for security operations, local media reported.
Inside the court, judge Ji called Yoon the ""insurrectionist leader"", although the judging panel found insufficient evidence to rule that he'd planned the martial law order a year before his announcement.
Yoon defended his actions throughout his trial, arguing that as president he had had the authority to declare martial law, sounding the alarm over opposition parties' obstruction of government.
He maintained that the order was necessary ""to protect the freedom and sovereignty of the people and to preserve the nation and its constitution"".
The ruling Democratic Party, which won the presidential election after Yoon's ouster, accused the court of ""undermining judicial justice"" by not sentencing Yoon to death.
""[Yoon] masterminded an insurrection that shook the very foundations of our nation,"" party leader Jung Chung-rae said.
""[Today's decision] is a clear regress from the people's revolution... The public will find it deeply unsatisfactory and unacceptable.""
South Korea has not executed anyone on death row since December 1997, so even a death penalty for Yoon would, in effect, be life imprisonment.
Yoon is already serving jail time for abuse of power and obstructing his own arrest after the martial law order. He still faces three more related trials.
Several former presidents before Yoon had also been convicted and jailed, but were pardoned after serving just two to five years in prison – and many expect the same for Yoon.

Mystery donor gives Japanese city $3.6m in gold bars to fix water system,2026-02-20T02:55:04.989Z," Koh Ewe
","A Japanese city has received a hefty donation to help fix its ageing water system: 21kg (46lb) in gold bars.
The gold bars, worth an estimated 560 million yen ($3.6m; £2.7m), were given last November by a donor who wished to remain anonymous, Osaka Mayor Hideyuki Yokoyama told a press conference on Thursday.
Home to nearly three million people, Osaka is a commercial hub located in the Japan's Kansai region and the country's third-largest city.
But like many Japanese cities, Osaka's water and sewage pipes are ageing - a growing cause for safety concern.
Osaka recorded more than 90 cases of water pipe leaks under its roads in the 2024 fiscal year, according to the city's waterworks bureau.
""Tackling ageing water pipes requires a huge investment. So I have nothing but appreciation,"" Yokoyama told reporters on Thursday, in response to a question about the huge gold donation.
Yokoyama said the amount was ""staggering"" and he was ""lost for words"".
The same mystery donor had previously given 500,000 yen in cash for municipal waterworks, he added.
The city's waterworks bureau said in a statement on Thursday that it was grateful for the gold donation and would put it to good use - including tackling the deterioration of water pipes.
More than 20% of Japan's water pipes have passed their legal service life of 40 years, according to local media.
Sinkholes have also become increasingly common in Japanese cities, many of which have ageing sewage pipeline infrastructure.
Last year, a massive sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture swallowed the cab of a truck, killing its driver. The sinkhole was believed to have been caused by a ruptured sewage pipe.
That incident prompted Japanese authorities to step up efforts to replace corroded pipes across the country. But budget issues have stalled the progress of such pipe renewal works.

Revealed: The billions given to charity by ordinary Indians every year,2026-02-20T01:54:20.077Z," Soutik Biswas
India correspondent
","India's philanthropy story is usually told from the top down.
It features corporate social responsibility (CSR) budgets, billionaire pledges and splashy foundations. But a new report argues that the real engine of Indian generosity is far more prosaic - and vastly larger.
The How India Gives 2025 report, produced by the Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy (CSIP) at Ashoka University, challenges the conventional narrative that organised, institutional money dominates the country's giving landscape. Instead, it points to a quieter colossus: households.
According to the report, India's total household giving is estimated at 540bn rupees ($6bn) annually, including cash, in-kind contributions and volunteering.
About 68% of respondents report giving in some form. Of this, 48% is in kind - such as food, clothing or other household goods - followed by cash donations (44%) and volunteering (30%) with non-profits, religious institutions or community groups.
Much of the food given goes to communal free kitchens. Volunteering most commonly takes the form of service at religious institutions, including activities such as disaster relief organised by them.
""India is a very generous country. Our findings suggest that ordinary households play a much larger role than is commonly acknowledged. Generosity appears widespread and culturally embedded,"" Jinny Uppal, head of Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy at Ashoka University, told the BBC.
The headline insight: Indian philanthropy is not elite-led but mass, local and relational - driven by faith, face-to-face appeals and everyday obligation, cutting across income levels.
The survey draws on more than 7,000 interviews across 20 states, spanning urban and rural India.
The analysis is anchored to India's National Sample Survey (NSS) consumption data - a large, government-run household expenditure survey - to build income-segmented profiles of everyday givers. Respondents self-reported how often and how much they gave over a three-month recall period. The findings were then extrapolated to produce annual estimates.
The survey looks at ""everyday giving"" which includes both direct, personal help - to beggars, family or friends, often seen as charity - and donations to organised, non-religious institutions, which are typically described as philanthropy.
It also examines ""retail giving"", typically defined as donations by ordinary individuals - not high-net-worth donors - to registered nonprofits. The survey adopts a broader lens, including informal, direct help to individuals as well as donations to religious institutions.
A lot of giving is shaped by proximity and faith, the survey found.
Roughly 40–45% of giving flows to religious organisations, with a comparable share directed to beggars and destitute people, especially in urban areas. In rural India, religious institutions take the lead.
""We asked behavioural questions about motivation. For more than 90% of respondents, the underlying driver is a sense of religious duty - a moral obligation that shapes and sustains their giving,"" says Krishanu Chakraborty, head of research at the Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy at Ashoka University.
The most common way people encounter giving opportunities is in-person requests or canvassing - meaning direct appeals at homes, religious sites or public spaces, rather than digital campaigns or formal fundraising drives.
The survey found education correlates with generosity: donor participation peaks among graduates and postgraduates.
Yet, giving is not confined to the affluent. Even at low consumption levels (4,000–5,000 rupees per month), about half of households report giving; as incomes rise, participation climbs to 70–80%.
Gender patterns are subtle but telling: male-headed households are slightly more inclined toward religious giving, while female-headed households lean marginally toward supporting destitute individuals.
""The most important takeaway [of the survey] is that everyday generosity in India is systemic rather than sporadic,"" Uppal says.
""It cuts across income groups, age, gender and urban/rural regions and is embedded in everyday social life.""
The second key takeaway: estimates suggest that everyday giving makes up about 15% of total giving in India, yet accounts for nearly a third of private donations to the organised social sector.
""Even with the small cheque size from everyday givers, this is a sizeable contribution from the citizenry towards social impact,"" says Uppal.
The final takeaway, according to the researchers, is more methodological.
The survey responses were anchored to consumption data, allowing researchers to examine how spending patterns relate to giving. As household consumption rises, both participation in giving and the amount donated tend to increase, the survey found.
""India remains one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and consumption is a major component of GDP. As household consumption expands over time, this segment of everyday giving is likely to evolve and potentially grow alongside it,"" says Uppal.
In mature markets, everyday individual giving is the financial backbone of NGOs - formal, tracked and institutionalised.
In 2024, individuals gave $392bn in the US, accounting for 66% of all charitable donations. In the UK, public donations reached $20.7bn, with legacies and individual giving making up roughly 30% of charitable income.
This is not surprising, say experts. Across much of the Global South, person-to-person, informal giving often exceeds formal donations. In advanced economies, by contrast, giving is largely channelled to registered nonprofits - helped by tax incentives and older, more organised charitable sectors.
The US Generosity Commission's 2024 report noted an apparent decline in everyday giving. But it tracks only audited donations to registered nonprofits made through tax channels.
As giving shifts toward informal routes - online transfers, crowdfunding and other unaudited platforms - much of this behaviour goes uncaptured. Even in the US, the way people give is changing, experts believe.
In India, says Uppal, the ""real headline"" isn't the percentage - it's the breadth of participation.
The survey, she says, was conducted in March–April, months with relatively few religious events or festivals. ""Given the high percent of giving to religious organisations, it is safe to assume that during other months with religious occasions, a larger percent of the population gives.""
In other words, in India generosity is possibly not a trickle from the top. It is a daily tide from below.

","KPop stars delivered the world's most popular songs of 2025, new music industry figures show.
Blackpink singer Rosé scored the year's biggest worldwide hit, with her Bruno Mars collaboration APT notching up more than two billion streams.
It is the first time a song featuring non-English lyrics has topped the annual global chart published by industry body the IFPI.
The year's second biggest hit of 2025 was Golden, performed by Huntr/x, the animated girl group from Netflix smash KPop Demon Hunters.
Scroll down to see the top 20.
The huge success of APT also marks the first time the IFPI chart has been topped by an artist from outside North America or Europe.
Although sung mostly in English, APT opens with some spoken Korean, which translates as: ""Chaeyoung's favourite random game. Random game. Game start.""
The song's chorus, then repeats the word ""아파트"" - which is pronounced ""apateu"", meaning ""apartment"" in English.
Victoria Oakley, CEO of the IFPI said it was a ""landmark moment"". The industry body has been publishing the annual lists since 2007.
Mars also featured on another song in the top five, with his Lady Gaga collaboration Die With A Smile coming in fourth place.
US singer Alex Warren's track Ordinary was the third-biggest single of the year, while Benson Boone's Beautiful Things rounded out the top five. Boone's song took the number one spot in 2024.
The chart is dominated by songs released in earlier years - eight of the top 10 biggest-selling singles were released before 2025.
For the second consecutive year, no British artists featured in the end-of-year global top 10.
However, singer Lola Young took 11th place with her breakthrough single Messy, which notched up more than one billion streams.
Another song from KPop Demon Hunters, Soda Pop by Huntr/x's rival boyband Saja Boys, also features in the top 20.
Earlier this week, the IFPI said Taylor Swift was the biggest artist overall globally in 2025.
She appears once in the top singles of the year, with The Fate of Ophelia, the lead single from her album The Life of a Showgirl, in 19th place.
The list of top 20 albums of the year will follow on Friday.

Bill Gates pulls out of India's AI summit over Epstein files controversy,2026-02-19T08:13:25.033Z," Cherylann MollanandLiv McMahon
technology reporter
","Bill Gates will not deliver his keynote address at the India AI Impact Summit in Delhi, his philanthropic organisation said hours before the Microsoft co-founder was due to speak.
The Gates Foundation said the decision was made after ""careful consideration"" and ""to ensure the focus remains on the [summit's] key priorities"", but did not elaborate.
Gates's withdrawal comes amid a controversy over his ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after he was named in new files released by the US Department of Justice in January.
Gates's spokesperson has called the claims in the files ""absolutely absurd and completely false"", and the billionaire has said he regretted spending time with Epstein.
Gates has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.
The Gates Foundation said Ankur Vora, president of its Africa and India offices, would speak at the summit instead of Gates.
The organisation added that it remained ""fully committed"" to its work in India to advance ""shared health and development goals"".
Gates's decision to not speak to the summit came after days of uncertainty over whether he would attend.
He is currently in India and had visited the southern state of Andhra Pradesh on Monday, where he reportedly discussed initiatives for boosting health, agriculture, education and technology.
After media reports speculated he would pull out of the summit, his foundation said on Tuesday he would deliver the address as scheduled.
Gates's withdrawal is a blow for the summit, which India has pitched as a flagship gathering to position the country as a global AI hub.
The five-day summit features policy discussions, start-up showcases and closed-door meetings on AI governance, infrastructure and innovation.
The event has also seen investment pledges by companies, including Microsoft, to expand AI access and infrastructure in countries such as India.
Delegates from more than 100 countries, including several world leaders, are attending the event.
But it has already been marked by some controversies over mismanagement on the first day and an Indian university's claims to have developed a robot dog - which turned out to be made in China.
Though Gates is not attending, other big names are appearing at the Summit.
OpenAI boss Altman said in a speech the world should ""urgently"" look to regulate AI.
""Democratisation of AI is the best way to ensure humanity flourishes,"" he said, adding that centralising the tech in one company or country ""could lead to ruin"".
""This is not to suggest that we won't need any regulation or safeguards,"" Altman added.
""We obviously do, urgently, like we have for other powerful technologies.""
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron made similar calls for AI's democratisation and for a shared approach to innovation.
Addressing the Summit, Modi said there was a need to share technology ""so that humans don't just become a data point for AI or remain a raw material for AI"".
""AI must become a medium for inclusion and empowerment, particularly for the Global South,"" he said.
Macron, who earlier held bilateral talks with Modi, said there was a need to change the discussion around AI from ""let's do more"" to ""let's do better together"".
This theme was addressed by other speakers as well, including UN chief Antonio Guterres - who stressed the future of AI should not be ""decided by a handful of countries"" or left to the ""whims of a few billionaires"".
Google's chief executive Sundai Pichai underscored India's growing role in the AI landscape.
He said his firm was working on establishing an AI hub in the southern city of Vishakhapatnam, which he said would help bring jobs and cutting-edge AI to Indians.
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani meanwhile pledged to invest $110bn (£81.4bn) over the next seven years to build India's AI ecosystem, while Anthropic boss Amodei said it would like to work with India on ""testing and evaluation of models for safety and security risks"".

Australian presenter apologises for drinking before slurred Olympics report,2026-02-19T04:11:15.541Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","An Australian sports presenter has apologised after a clip of her slurring her way through a live cross from the Winter Olympics in Italy went viral, with even Australia's prime minister weighing in.
Channel Nine reporter Danika Mason said she had ""misjudged the situation"" by drinking ahead of her appearance on live television, also blaming the altitude, the cold and her failure to eat dinner.
""I want to take full responsibility, it's not the standard I set myself,"" she said during another appearance a day later, adding that she was ""embarrassed"".
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was ""pro-Danika"" and that there was ""nothing to see here"" suggesting she had been affected by jet lag.
Mason stumbled over her words and talked about iguanas and the price of coffee as she reported on the day's sports events.
""Literally like the price of coffee over here is actually fine, it's more the price of coffee in the US that we're gonna have to get used to. I'm not sure about the iguanas, where are we going with that one?"" she said during her cross to the breakfast television show Today on Wednesday, apparently in response to comments from the studio hosts.
With glazed eyes she then stumbled through the rest of her sports report, mixing up her words as well as the UK and the US, while studio host Karl Stefanovic could be heard laughing in the background.
""Look the cold weather is a thing, right,"" Stevanovic said unprompted afterwards. ""You can't actually move your lips.""
Social media clips of her report prompted mixed reactions from Australians.
""Good on her, nothing wrong with this. You can tell she's having an absolute ball over there,"" said one person on X, while another commented: ""If it's not a health issue, she should be sacked on the spot - very unprofessional.""
Mason, a prominent sports reporter best known for her National Rugby League coverage, appeared again on the Today show on Thursday morning.
After she delivered her live report, she told viewers she wanted to ""take a moment, if that's OK, just to apologise"" for her previous appearance.
She thanked viewers for messages of concern and continued: ""I'm OK, probably just a little embarrassed.
""Look, I totally misjudged the situation, I shouldn't have had a drink, especially in these conditions, it's cold, we've got altitude, and not having had dinner probably didn't help as well. But I want to take full responsibility, it's not the standard I set myself.
""So in saying that, I'm genuinely really sorry and I'm thanking everyone for those messages I've received as well.""
The Today show host Jayne Azzopardi responded saying ""we know how hard you work, Danika"" while Stefanovic called her a ""legend"".

Philippine VP Sara Duterte to run for president in 2028,2026-02-18T04:09:51.406Z," Joel Guinto
","Philippine Vice-President Sara Duterte has declared her candidacy for president in the 2028 elections.
The 47-year-old's announcement comes as she is embroiled in a bitter power struggle with current President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.
While the presidential vote is two years away, contenders in the Philippines' largely personality-based elections are known to prepare for years in advance.
Marcos is ineligible for re-election and his allies have yet to field a challenger to Duterte - who is also the daughter of his predecessor, former president Rodrigo Duterte.
""I offer my life, my strength, and my future in the service of our nation,"" the vice-president said.
""I am Sara Duterte. I will run for president of the Philippines.""
Marcos and Duterte ran under the same ticket in the 2022 election, which they won by a landslide. But the alliance soon unravelled as they pursued separate political interests.
The feud blew up spectacularly in March 2025, when Marcos allowed the International Criminal Court to arrest Sara's father. The elder Duterte is now detained at The Hague, awaiting trial for crimes against humanity over his violent war on drugs.
Two months later, a mid-term legislative vote, seen as a barometer of support for the incumbent government, delivered a victory for candidates endorsed by the Duterte family, against those handpicked by Marcos.
Just over a week ago, members of the Catholic clergy filed an impeachment complaint against the vice-president over alleged corruption, which she denies.
Sara is Rodrigo Duterte's eldest daughter and is widely-considered as his political heir.
The elder Duterte once described his daughter as the ""alpha"" in their family, the one whom everyone follows.
Sara served as vice-mayor to her father when he led Davao city in the 2010s. It was in that southern metropolis that the Duterte's built their reputation for being tough on crime, which they have described as necessary to keep people safe and encourage businesses to grow.
Sara was thrust into the national spotlight when, in defence of shanty town dwellers, she punched a Davao sheriff in full view of TV news cameras.
She was Davao city mayor when her father was president from 2016 and 2022, and her alliance with Marcos in the 2022 elections was pivotal for both their election victories.
The vice-president, like her father, projects a tough image. She rides large motorcycles and has given her children nicknames like Sharky, Stonefish and Stingray. She also shares matching tattoos with her two brothers.

Australia bans citizen trying to return from IS camp in Syria,2026-02-18T07:08:18.143Z," Kelly Ng
","Australia has barred a citizen linked to the Islamic State (IS) group from the country for up to two years.
The person is among the group of 34 Australian women and children who tried to head home after being released from a Syrian camp earlier this week, only to be turned back by Syrian authorities for ""technical reasons"".
The ban was issued ""on advice from security agencies"", Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said on Wednesday, adding that the other 33 people do not meet ""required legal thresholds"" to be banned.
Canberra has refused to repatriate the group, believed to be made up of the wives, widows and children of IS fighters. There are 23 children among them.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stressed that these families will not receive government support to come back to the country.
""You make your bed, you lie in it,"" he told a press conference on Wednesday.
""These are people who chose to go overseas to align themselves with... a brutal, reactionary ideology that seeks to undermine and destroy our way of life.""
However legal experts have warned the government has an obligation to allow citizens the right of return, and, responding to reports the group had valid Australian passports, Albanese said his government would not ""breach Australian law"".
This group in the al-Roj camp in northern Syria is among dozens of Australians who have been held in camps and prisons across the country since 2019, when IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria.
Opposition politicians have raised security concerns about the possibility of these Australians' return.
""How can only one member of this group be deemed a risk and the rest somehow okay?"" Liberal Party Senator Jonno Duniam said on Tuesday, offering to help amend laws to bar more of the group.
The al-Roj camp is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities, mainly women and children.
Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.
Speaking to ABC, the camp's director Hakmiyeh Ibrahim made an appeal to all countries that have citizens held in limbo there: ""Take your citizens, take these children and women"".
The children especially are growing up surrounded by ""dangerous ideas and ideologies"" in the camp, she said. ""The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.""
Several of these camps have made headlines as the women and children living in them are severely malnourished and lack access to basic resources.
Several other foreign governments - including France, the Netherlands, and the UK - have also refused to repatriate most of their citizens still held in Syria.

China is hitting Japan where it hurts. Will PM Takaichi give in?,2026-02-16T23:21:29.232Z," Tessa Wong
Asia Digital Reporter
","Last month at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, after receiving thousands of tearful goodbyes from Japanese fans, Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei were put on a plane bound for China - the latest symbols of the deteriorating relationship between China and Japan.
The two giant Chinese pandas had to return home after Beijing announced it was taking them back, leaving Japan without any Chinese pandas for the first time in decades.
Since Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi made comments that have plunged ties with China to their lowest level in years, Beijing has been piling on the pressure in a wide range of ways - sending warships, throttling rare earth exports, curbing Chinese tourism, cancelling concerts and even reclaiming its pandas.
As Takaichi begins a new term as PM after winning a historically strong public mandate from a recent snap election, analysts warn that both sides will find it difficult to de-escalate - and the China-Japan relationship will not recover anytime soon.
The row began in November, when Takaichi appeared to suggest that Japan would activate its self-defence force in the event of an attack on Taiwan.
China claims self-governed Taiwan as its own and has not ruled out the use of force to ""reunify"" with it one day. The island counts the US as its key ally, and Washington has pledged to help Taiwan defend itself.
The worry has long been that any attack on Taiwan could result in a direct military conflict between the US and China, and then widen to include other US allies in the region such as Japan and the Philippines.
The issue of Taiwan is an absolute red line for China, which reacts furiously to any comment perceived as ""outside interference"" and insists that it is a question of sovereignty that only China can decide for itself.
Almost immediately after Takaichi's remarks, Beijing responded with a flurry of condemnation and demanded a retraction.
Observers have noted that Takaichi's comments were in line with the government's position and what other Japanese leaders have said in the past.
But the difference is that it was the first time a sitting Japanese prime minister had voiced such views.
For her part, Takaichi refused to apologise or retract her remarks, a stance that analysts say may likely be vindicated by the strong mandate she has won.
But she said she would be more careful about commenting on specific scenarios, and her government has sent senior diplomats to meet their Chinese counterparts.
This, however, has done little to allay Chinese anger.

Faced with Takaichi's steady refusal to back down, China has piled on a steady stream of pressure.
While spats have flared up between the two countries in recent decades, fueled by historical animosity, this time it feels different, say analysts.
China has expanded its pressure on a much ""wider range of fronts"", noted Robert Ward, the Japan chair for the think tank International Institute of Strategic Studies.
It is a diffuse, low-level pressure that is similar to the ""greyzone warfare"" it conducts on Taiwan, he said, where it's aimed at ""wearing down [the opponent] to normalise things that actually are not normal"".
Diplomatically, it has lodged complaints with the United Nations and postponed a trilateral summit with Japan and South Korea.
China has also tried to pull other parties into the fray and has called on the UK and France to side with it, while urging its allies Russia and North Korea to denounce Japan.
Over the weekend, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi invoked Japan's World War Two history of aggression while addressing Western leaders at the Munich Security Conference, and called Takaichi's remarks a ""very dangerous development"".
On the military front, Japan has claimed that China has sent drones, sailed warships past their islands and its fighter jets have ""locked radars"" on their planes. Japanese and Chinese coast guard ships have confronted one another near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, while last week Japanese authorities seized a Chinese fishing vessel.
But it is clear that China also wants to hit Japan where it hurts - its economy.
Beijing has imposed restrictions on exports to Japan for dual-use technologies including rare earth elements and critical minerals, in what has been seen as a form of economic coercion.
It has also warned Chinese citizens to avoid Japan for their studies and holidays, and cancelled flight on 49 routes to Japan, leading to a drop in tourists and a slide in some stocks. Chinese nationals make up a quarter of all foreign tourists to Japan, according to official figures.
Even entertainment and culture is not off the hook.
Japanese music events have been cancelled in China, including one where a singer was rushed off stage mid-performance, while film distributors have postponed the release of several Japanese movies.
One of Japan's most famous cultural exports, Pokemon, was also criticised over an event that was due to be held at the Yasukuni Shrine. The temple honours Japan's war dead including some that China considers as war criminals. The event was eventually cancelled.
And on the social media front, Chinese online nationalists have launched attacks on Takaichi, including sharing AI-generated videos showing pop culture figure Ultraman and anime character Detective Conan fighting the prime minister.
But overall, China has taken actions that have been less provocative compared to previous conflicts with Japan, noted Bonny Lin and Kristi Govella with the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
""Thus far, its economic and military responses have been relatively limited compared to the past, but there is ample room for further escalation,"" they noted in a recent analysis.
China may also be holding back on going too hard on Japan as it is currently ""actively positioning itself as the guardian of the post World War Two order"" and wants to be seen as a responsible power compared to the US, added Ward.
Observers agree that if or when tensions calm down, they will likely settle at a higher level than before.
Both sides are less likely to de-escalate this time round, noted Lin and Govella in their analysis. China is a much stronger power now, and ""Taiwan is the core of Chinese core interests, which means that Beijing is more likely to take a hardline position than in past episodes"".
""Beijing is also deeply suspicious of Takaichi and are likely to view her attempts to de-escalate without explicitly retracting her comments as hypocritical or, even worse, strategically deceptive,"" they added.
Meanwhile, Japan has a greater appetite to stand firm especially with Takaichi's huge electoral win, which ""she will take this as vindication for her stance on China"", noted Ward.
Govella told the BBC that Takaichi would likely use her win as ""political capital"" to advance defence and economic policies that will strengthen Japan's position.
Takaichi has pledged to raise Japan's defence-related spending to 2% of the GDP two years ahead of schedule, complete a revision of key security strategies by the end of this year, and launch an economic stimulus package soon.
In turn, China ""sees that Takaichi is a pretty strong leader and the pressure campaign could only make her stronger domestically, [so] they may not intensify their pressure much,"" said Kiyoteru Tsutsui, a Japan expert and director of the Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University.
""So this tango will likely continue on for a while.""
The wildcard could be that US President Donald Trump has so far pledged strong support for Takaichi, issuing an unusual endorsement for her in the run-up to the snap election.
But many expect US-China relations to warm further this year, Tsutsui noted, with several scheduled meetings between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping including the US president's state visit to Beijing in April.
And compared to previous incidents, the US response to the latest spat ""has been muted so far, which may embolden China"", said Lin and Govella.
""The Japanese are terrified there's going to be some grand bargain between Xi and Trump,"" said Ward.
Over the weekend, the US and Japan affirmed their ties on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in a meeting between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi.
Takaichi is also due to meet Trump again in March when she visits Washington DC, ahead of his trip to China.
As China keeps piling on the pressure, Tokyo will likely ""double down"" on shouldering more of the defence burden it shares with the US, said Ward, and ""really work more closely with them to make sure that the US doesn't sort of drift off and lose interest in the region"".

'Dragged out and set on fire' - the Bangladesh mob killing that shocked the world,2026-02-16T00:09:58.833Z," Soutik Biswas
India correspondent
in Mymensingh
","The morning before he died, Dipu Chandra Das left home at first light, stepping out of his tin-sheet house in Bangladesh's Mymensingh city, overlooking a warren of lanes off the highway from Dhaka.
The 28-year-old woke up his father, said goodbye to his wife, cradled his 18-month-old daughter. Then he boarded a bus for the 60km (37-mile) journey to the garment factory where he worked as a junior quality inspector, checking sweaters bound for global high-street brands such as H&M and Next.
His family would not see him again.
Warning: Some readers may find the details below disturbing
Twenty-four hours later, on 18 December, Das, a Hindu, was dead - lynched and burned by a mob after being accused of blasphemy.
Accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad, he was dragged from his workplace, beaten, hauled more than a kilometre through crowded streets, tied to a tree on a busy highway and set alight before hundreds of onlookers.
The killing sparked global outrage, particularly across the border in India, reviving fears about the safety of minorities since then prime minister Sheikh Hasina was toppled in student-led protests in 2024. About 9% of Bangladesh's 174 million people belong to religious minorities - mostly Hindus. Relations with the Muslim majority have long been marked by periodic tension and insecurity.
Fifty days on, the outrage has ebbed, but grief hangs over the home Das left behind - a single dark room with a beaten-earth floor and tin roof, where the family has lived for nearly 15 years.
It is a house with little furniture or belongings: a plastic table and chairs, beds, sacks of rice, a teddy bear, clothes hanging from a single rail. A refrigerator and a small television - both bought by Dipu on instalments - stand out, quiet markers of a future he was still trying to build.
His mother, Shefali Rani Das, breaks down as soon as visitors enter.
""Oh Dipu, where is my Dipu?"" she cries, collapsing into a mournful lament.
Dipu was the eldest son of Rabi Das, a 54-year-old labourer who has spent his life hauling sacks of rice, wheat and vegetables at a nearby market for 400 to 500 taka ($3- $4) a day.
Years of hard work have left him weather-beaten and broken. Dipu wanted him to stop.
""Now I am working,"" he would tell his father often. ""You rest.""
Dipu would hand over his salary to the family. He talked constantly about building a proper house, one that would lift the family out of mud and tin for good.
Born at home and raised in a mixed Hindu-Muslim neighbourhood shaped by quiet hardship, Dipu was, by all accounts, a private man with few friends. He left college during the pandemic as lockdowns crushed the family's finances.
By 2024, he was working at a sweater factory, sending money home, and returning from his dorm with chocolates for his infant daughter, spending evenings watching cartoons on TV.
The eldest of three sons, his ambition, his mother said, was to see his younger brothers, Apu, 22, and Rithick, 16, ""settled"".
Dipu was a small cog in Bangladesh's garment export machine, working for the past 14 months at the Pioneer Knitwear factory. The unit employs about 8,500 workers and is one of nine factories in a group with a workforce of 47,000.
Its sweaters, stitched on long production lines, retail in shops across the US and Europe. Dipu, earning 13,500 taka ($110; £80) a month, checked stitches and seams on one of the factory's hundred production lines. He was one of 868 Hindu workers there.
It was an ordinary life, lived carefully - a young man trying to pull his family out of poverty.
Then came the fateful December evening. A rumour swept through his workplace and outside that he had uttered a 'katukti' - Bengali for an insulting remark - against Prophet Muhammad.
What happened next, in the hours between the allegation and his death, is now the subject of a police investigation.
On the evening in question, a casual chat about weekend plans among three female co-workers near closing time took an uncomfortable turn when Dipu joined in and allegedly made a remark later deemed offensive to the Prophet, according to Mohammed Abdullah Al-Mamun, the additional superintendent of police in Mymensingh, citing accounts from at least three witnesses.
Factory CCTV footage shows Dipu clocking out about 30 minutes after this conversation. He later returned to the floor - footage from two hours later shows him roaming the area, according to Uday Hossain, a senior factory manager.
Why Dipu went back after checking out remains unclear.
Outside a mob had begun to collect as word spread that a factory worker had committed blasphemy. (Bangladesh has no formal blasphemy law, but it criminalises acts ""intended to outrage religious feelings"".)
As workers poured out at the end of the day, the rumour travelled fast in a busy neighbourhood. By about 6pm, tension had hardened both inside the factory and on the street.
""What followed went far beyond the law,"" said Al-Mamun.
A mob that began as several hundred at the factory gates demanding Dipu be handed over quickly swelled to more than a thousand, drawing in onlookers from nearby areas. CCTV footage shows men trying to force the gates and hurling ropes over them to climb inside.
At around 20.42 local time, Hossain says, the crowd used shovels to prise open a smaller side gate, poured into the factory, and ""carried Dipu away like a wave"".
Hossain said the factory had alerted police at least 45 minutes earlier. Yet even as industrial police and officers in plain clothes arrived at the site, they were unable to extract him from the mob, he added.
Police, however, offer a slightly different account of how Dipu ended up in the mob's hands.
They say the crowd threatened to break down the gates if he was not handed over. Faced with that ultimatum, factory workers opened the gate and released him, according to Al-Mamun.
Investigators believe Dipu was beaten to death outside the factory before his body was dragged to a nearby highway, tied with a rope to a tree, and set on fire. ""By the time I arrived, he was already dead,"" Al-Mamun said.
So far, 22 people have been arrested in connection with the incident. Half of those held were Dipu's co-workers at the factory, including two managers of the floor where he worked. An imam of a local mosque has also been arrested.
Most of the suspects are aged between 22 and 30. Police estimate that around 150 people were directly involved in the attack, with many more present as onlookers, while others are still being sought by police.
Few of those arrested, Al-Mamun said, appeared ""particularly religious"".
""Some are students, some are passersby, some are locals. Everyone was beating Dipu, so they beat him too. But we are treating this as a hate crime.""
Since the student uprising of 2024, the scale and nature of attacks on minorities - mainly Hindus - have become a fiercely contested question in Bangladesh.
The outgoing interim government says that between January and December 2025, police records show 645 incidents involving minorities but insists that nearly nine in 10 were not communal.
Officials say that most cases involved ordinary criminality - land disputes, theft, extortion, or personal feuds - that were later framed as religious violence. By its count, only 71 incidents had a clear communal element, including 38 cases of temple vandalism, eight attacks on temples, and one killing.
Human-rights groups paint a darker picture.
Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) records 42 incidents of violence against Hindus in 2025, including dozens of attacks on homes and arson, leaving one dead and 15 injured - numbers that broadly overlap with, but are narrower than, the government's tally.
The biggest divergence comes from the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, which says violence spiked dramatically after August 2024.
Mainly drawing on media reports, the group says it has documented 2,711 attacks on minorities since August 2024 - including at least 92 killings, 133 attacks on temples and 47 cases of land grabbing - figures far higher than official estimates.
""Minorities in Bangladesh have faced attacks by religious extremists for more than half a century. Governments of all stripes share responsibility. Our numbers have steadily shrunk as many have fled or migrated,"" Manindra Kumar Nath of the Council told the BBC.
India, meanwhile, says independent sources have documented more than 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities - including killings, arson and land grabs - during the interim government's tenure.
Nobel laureate and outgoing interim government chief Muhammad Yunus has said, ""there's no anti-Hindu violence"", dismissing such reports as ""fake news"" by the Indian media. Separately, he has said the attacks were ""political, not religious"".
Yet, all is not lost. Dipu's killing sparked protests in Dhaka; his employers have cleared his dues and promised to build the house he dreamed of. The outgoing government has pledged $35,000 toward the new home and additional compensation for his family.
""What happened was barbaric, deplorable and shameful. We want the strictest punishment for those responsible,"" said Badshah Mian, managing director of Pioneer Knitwear. ""If this can happen outside a factory, none of us is safe.""
That note of solidarity has persisted despite wider tensions.
After Hasina fled the country in 2024, Hindu minorities - often seen as aligned with her secular Awami League in an Islamic state - were attacked by rivals, even as some young Muslim groups moved to protect Hindu homes and shrines.
And ahead of the recently concluded election, Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) pledged: ""We want to build a Bangladesh together - the kind of Bangladesh a mother dreams of,"" reaching out to people of all religions.
Back at Dipu's home, the night of the killing is recalled in fragments.
A phone call around eight in the evening. A visit to the police station. A father stumbling home to deliver news that shattered the household.
His parents had collapsed. For hours, they were unconscious, neighbours later said - revived with water, then saline injections as the house filled with people and cries.
Nearly two months on, Dipu's mother still breaks down every day. His father has not returned to work. Sleep has vanished. So has appetite, routine, peace.
""Our life has stalled. Nothing is moving anymore,"" says Rabi Das.

UK doctor stuck in India after police case over Facebook post,2026-02-20T06:52:25.652Z," Alpesh Karkare
BBC Marathi
","A British doctor has been unable to leave India for more than a month after police opened a case against him over a social media post about a top politician of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Sangram Patil, a UK citizen of Indian origin who works with the NHS, was stopped from taking a flight back to London from Mumbai on 19 January after a lookout circular was issued against him - a notice that prevents a person under investigation from leaving the country.
He is being investigated for allegedly posting ""objectionable content"" about a BJP leader.
Patil, who has a substantial following on Facebook and YouTube, has called the action against him ""unlawful"".
It's not clear when the doctor will be allowed to go back to the UK. He has approached a court, seeking the police case registered against him be dropped and travel restrictions imposed on him be removed. The matter is due to be next heard on 27 February.
""My children and my job are in the UK. International law and Indian law give me the right to move freely. Restrictions have been imposed on that. I am not able to go home,"" he told BBC Marathi last week.
The BBC has reached out to the Mumbai police, which is investigating the case, for a comment.
A spokesperson from the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office did not offer specifics but said last week that they ""are supporting a British man in India and are in contact with the local authorities"".
Police say they are investigating Patil over a complaint filed by Nikhil Bhamre, who handles BJP's social media in the western state of Maharashtra of which Mumbai is the capital.
Bhamre's complaint, registered on 18 December, accuses Patil of publishing ""objectionable content"" against a top BJP leader on Facebook. The complaint did not name the BJP leader who was targeted, but it came four days after Patil had posted a comment about Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Facebook.
The police complaint that BBC has seen a copy of contains a link to this post.
According to the police complaint, Bhamre alleged that ""the post could create hostility between various groups that support and oppose the BJP's ideology"".
Police registered a case against Patil under India's criminal code ""for making statements containing false information that could lead to a feeling of enmity and hatred between communities"". The offence is bailable and carries a maximum sentence of up to three years.
Patil has rejected the allegations, saying it was ""unlawful to register such a complaint against me for that social media post"".
""My post is a simple question to government supporters and nothing else. It doesn't involve any community, any rumour or sensational news,"" Patil told BBC Marathi.
He said he was first questioned for more than 10 hours when he arrived in Mumbai on 10 January with his wife, and again for eight hours on 16 January. He said he had provided ""written answers to all"" the police questions and asked for the lookout circular to be withdrawn so he could return to the UK on 19 January.
He said officers told him the process to cancel the notice had been initiated, but he was stopped at the airport on the day of his flight.
Being questioned for more than 20 hours over what he described as a single line on social media felt like ""targeted harassment"", he added.
In an affidavit filed on 30 January, police defended the action against Patil saying the investigation was at a crucial stage and ""the possibility of an organised effort to malign constitutional authority cannot be ruled out"".
""It is a matter of serious concern, warranting investigation as to why a foreign citizen, despite being a qualified medical professional, visiting India on a Tourist e-Visa, has engaged in posting defamatory, scandalous, obscene and inflammatory material without any substance and basis against the prime minister of India while residing outside the country,"" the police told the court.
They have also urged the court to dismiss Patil's ""misconceived and premature"" plea challenging the investigation against him.
In a rejoinder filed in court last week, Patil denied the allegations.
According to court filings reported by The Indian Express newspaper, he ""categorically denied"" writing any post naming or referring to the prime minister, adding that ""criminal prosecution cannot be founded on subjective political interpretation or perceived sentiment"".

How do you modernise mango farming?,2026-02-20T00:05:20.285Z," Priti Gupta
Technology Reporter
Mumbai
","Even in good years, mangoes are considered one of the most difficult fruit crops to cultivate.
They depend on a delicate balance of climate, tree physiology, and farming techniques.
Getting that balance right is crucial for India, the world's biggest producer of mangoes, where 23 million tonnes of the fruit is harvested every year - almost a fifth of India's total fruit output.
But for many farmers mango cultivation has, in recent years, become more challenging.
""Mango farming has become unpredictable,"" says Upendra Singh, who farms 16 acres of land in Malihabad, in the northwestern state of Uttar Pradesh.
He is the fourth generation of mango farmers in his family, and started work on the farm when he was 12-years-old.
""Seasons no longer follow a pattern. Flowering, fruiting, and harvesting all shift every year because of climate change,"" says Singh, now 62.
""Input costs have gone up, pesticides, labour, irrigation. But yields have gone down. Farmers are spending more money but earning less from mango orchards,"" he adds.
Almost 700 varieties of mango are cultivated across India, with each region having its own dominant variety. So, in northern India the Dasheri is the most common, in Maharashta the Alphonso dominates, and in Bihar and West Bengal the Langra and Malda varieties are most frequently seen.
But few farmers escape the effects of climate change.
""With erratic weather patterns becoming the norm, mango farming is under pressure,"" says Dr Hari Shankar Singh, a scientist at the Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (ICAR).
""Mango is highly temperature-dependent,"" he explains.
""Last year, flowering happened early, strong winds affected fruit development, maturity came too fast, and much of the crop went waste.
""This year, prolonged low temperatures in north India delayed flowering altogether,"" Singh says.
To help make farmers more resilient, researchers are developing new varieties of mango which can tolerate wider temperature ranges and resist pests and disease.
But it's slow work. Mango trees take between five and ten years to flower after breeding.
In addition mango trees have another unhelpful biological quirk: they are heterozygous, meaning offspring rarely resemble their parents.
""Mango breeding is a multi-decade scientific commitment, not a quick innovation,"" says Hari Singh.
Genetic science is helping speed up that process. ICAR led a group of scientists who announced the sequencing of the mango genome in 2016.
Their work focused on the Alphonso mango.
""Mango genome sequencing allows researchers to identify genes linked to fruit colour, aroma, sweetness, flowering behaviour, climate resilience and disease tolerance,"" says Hari Singh.
That has ""significantly"" reduced the 10 to 20 years traditionally needed for mango breeding he says.
Farmers are ready to embrace innovation when it comes along.
On his farm, Upendra Singh has planted a new variety of mango, the coloured mango, in greater density than his old orchard.
""The biggest advantage of coloured varieties is they give fruit every year. Traditional varieties like Dasheri and Langda often have off years,"" Upendra Singh says.
Modern cultivation techniques also help.
""Scientific pruning, canopy management, and growth regulators are being used to control tree size, induce flowering, and manage early or uniform harvests,"" he says.
ICAR encourages farmers to use several techniques to improve their crops.
""Bagging"" is a simple innovation, where each fruit is enclosed in a breathable protective cover in its early development.
""This method creates a controlled micro-environment around the fruit, reducing exposure to insect infestation, fungal pathogens, mechanical damage, and excessive solar radiation,"" says Dr T Damodaran, the Director of ICAR.
His organisation also recommends another technique, called ""girdling"". The involves making a narrow, controlled ring cut on selected branches. The resultant stress on the tree redirects the tree's energy towards flowering and fruit development.
Older orchards can also be rejuvenated, by cutting the trees down to between 14 and 18 feet in height.
""Once rejuvenated, flowering improves dramatically, fruit size increases, and most fruits become A-grade instead of B or C grade,"" says Hari Singh.
For Neeti Goel, mango farming started as a hobby. Ten years ago she planted a few trees out of curiosity.
Now she has more than 1,100 trees across 27 acres in Alibhaug, in the central state of Maharashtra.
""Instead of traditional trial-and-error farming, we use scientific mango cultivation,"" she says.
""We start every season with soil and leaf analysis. Without that, fertiliser application is guesswork, not farming. Micronutrients like boron and zinc play a decisive role in fruit, so ignoring them directly impacts yield.""
Her next step could be to move the trees inside.
""We have stared building greenhouses so that the temperature can be controlled. If one does not adopt innovative methods we are doomed.""
Saravanan Achari also believes that covering the trees is the way forward.
Achari is the founder of Berrydale Foods, which exports Indian mangoes to 13 countries.
Pests are one of is main concerns.
""Export markets demand zero tolerance on pests. Even if inspectors find a single fruit fly, the entire consignment is discarded, leading to huge losses,"" he says.
Climate change is making it more difficult to manage pests. Fruit flies appear after rainfall, but climate change is making that rainfall more unpredictable, so pests are appearing at different times of the year.
""Climate change has become the single biggest risk factor for mango exports today,"" says Achari.
So Achari is experimenting with greenhouses on Berrydale's farm.
""Countries like Japan and Israel are already using greenhouse and protected cultivation because they face similar climate challenges. Indian farmers will also have to move in this direction if we want consistent quality and reliable exports.""

The Chinese AI app sending Hollywood into a panic,2026-02-19T23:08:29.369Z," Osmond Chia
Business reporterandSuranjana Tewari
Asia Business Correspondent
","A new artificial intelligence (AI) model developed by the Chinese company behind TikTok rocked Hollywood this week - not just because of what it can do, but what it could mean for creative industries.
Created by tech giant ByteDance, Seedance 2.0 can generate cinema-quality video, complete with sound effects and dialogue, from just a few written prompts.
Many of the clips said to have been made using Seedance, and featuring popular characters like Spider-Man and Deadpool, went viral.
Major studios like Disney and Paramount quickly accused ByteDance of copyright infringement but concerns about the technology run deeper than legal issues.
Seedance was launched to little fanfare in June 2025 but it is the second version that came eight months later that has caused a major stir.
""For the first time, I'm not thinking that this looks good for AI. Instead, I'm thinking that this looks straight out of a real production pipeline,"" says Jan-Willem Blom from creative studio Videostate.
Western AI video models have made progress in processing user instructions to make stunning images, he adds, but Seedance seems to have tied everything together.
Like other AI tools - Midjourney and OpenAI's Sora - Seedance can create videos from short text prompts. In some cases just one prompt seems to be producing high-quality videos.
It is particularly impressive because it combines text, visuals and audio in a single system, AI ethics researcher Margaret Mitchell says.
Seedance's impact is being measured by an unlikely benchmark: how well it generates a clip of Will Smith eating spaghetti.
Not only can Seedance create a remarkably life-like version of the star tucking into a plate of pasta, it has also spawned viral videos of Smith battling a spaghetti monster - and it looks and feels like a big-budget movie.
Many industry experts and filmmakers believe Seedance is a new chapter in the development of video-generating technology.
The complex action sequences it is producing look more realistic than its competitors, says David Kwok, who runs a Singapore-based animation studio called Tiny Island Productions.
""It almost feels like having a cinematographer or director of photography specialising in action films assisting you.""
Seedance has run into trouble over copyright issues, a growing challenge in the age of AI.
Experts warn that AI companies are prioritising technology over people as they make more powerful tools and use data without paying for it.
Major Hollywood groups have cried foul over Seedance's use of copyrighted characters like Spider Man and Darth Vader. Disney and Paramount issued cease-and-desist letters demanding that Seedance stop using their content. Japan is also investigating ByteDance for alleged copyright violations, after AI videos of popular anime characters went viral.
ByteDance has said it was taking steps to ""strengthen current safeguards"". This is not unique to the Chinese firm.
In 2023, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging they used its articles without permission to train their AI models. Reddit sued Perplexity last year, claiming the AI firm had illegally scraped user posts. Disney raised similar concerns with Google.
Clearly labelling content to prevent deception and building public trust in AI is far more important than ""cooler-looking"" videos, Mitchell says.
And that's why developers must build systems that manage licensing and payments, and provide clear mechanisms for people to contest misuse, she adds.
Disney, for instance, signed a $1bn (£730m) deal with OpenAI's Sora so it could use characters from Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel.
Seedance's developers were likely to have been aware of potential copyright issues around the use of Western IP and took a risk anyway, says Shaanan Cohney, a computing researcher at the University of Melbourne.
""There's plenty of leeway to bend the rules strategically, to flout the rules for a while and get marketing clout,"" he adds.
Meanwhile, for small firms, Seedance is too useful to ignore.
Kwok, from Singapore's Tiny Island Productions, says AI of this quality will allow companies like his to create films that would cost far more than they can otherwise afford.
He gave the example of Asia's booming short‑form videos and micro‑dramas that typically run on small budgets - roughly $140,000 for as many as 80 episodes under two minutes each.
These productions have been sticking to romance or family drama to keep costs down as they need fewer visual effects. But now AI can ""elevate low-budget productions into more ambitious genres such as sci-fi, period drama and, now, action"", Kwok says.
Seedance once again puts Chinese tech in the spotlight.
""It signals that Chinese models are at the very least matching at the frontier of what is available,"" Cohney says. ""If ByteDance can produce this seemingly out of nowhere, what other kinds of models do Chinese companies have in store?""
Last year DeepSeek, another Chinese AI model, sent shockwaves around the world with its low-cost large language model. It quickly overtook ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on Apple's US store.
In the year since Beijing has put AI and robotics at the core of its economic strategy, investing heavily in advanced computer chip production, automation and generative AI as it bids for a technological edge over the US.
While Seedance 2.0 was making headlines, other big Chinese firms had lower-profile rollouts of their new generative AI tools ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.
The Spring Festival is increasingly becoming an ""AI holiday,"" with firms timing launches for a period when millions of people are at home and experimenting with new apps, China analyst Bill Bishop wrote in his newsletter.
He predicts 2026 could mark a turning point for mass AI adoption in China - not just chatbots, but also AI agents handling transactions, coding tools incorporated in everyday work, and video creators routinely using AI.

What you need to know about the verdict against South Korea's impeached president,2026-02-19T07:37:56.573Z," Leehyun Choi
SeoulandKelly Ng
","South Korea's ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been jailed for life for leading an insurrection, a little over a year after he tried imposing military rule.
His short-lived decree threw South Korea into turmoil, deeply divided the country and handed the opposition a landslide victory six months later.
Yoon, 65, has already been handed a five-year jail term for abuse of power and obstructing his own arrest. He also faces two more trials. But today's verdict involved the most serious charge - leading an insurrection.
Insurrection refers to the act of revolting against or overthrowing an established government or authority of a nation state, often by violent means.
Under South Korea's constitution, sitting presidents are immune from criminal prosecution, except when the charge is insurrection or treason.
On Thursday, a Seoul court ruled that Yoon's actions on 3 December 2024 – in particular, deploying military troops to seal off the National Assembly and ordering the arrest of politicians – were acts to subvert the constitution.
""The court finds that the intention was to paralyse the assembly for a considerable period,"" presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon said while convicting Yoon as the ""chief insurrectionist"".
Prosecutors sought the death penalty, describing Yoon as ""unrepentant"". They argued that a lesser sentence may not send a strong enough message to those who may wish to attempt something similar.
Yoon had earlier claimed he declared martial law to protect the country from ""anti-state"" forces that sympathised with North Korea. But in the weeks that followed it became apparent that he was driven by other challenges: he had become a lame-duck president facing plummeting ratings, scandals and an opposition that was threatening to investigate his wife over corruption allegations.
But even during his trial, he continued defending the martial law order, calling it ""a measure to protect the freedom and sovereignty of the people and to preserve the nation and its constitution"".
This isn't the first time a former South Korean leader has been convicted for his role in an insurrection.
Chun Doo-hwan, who ruled South Korea in the 1980s as a military dictator, was sentenced to death for leading an insurrection, though this was later reduced to life imprisonment. His ally and successor Roh Tae-woo was handed a lengthy jail term for his part in it. Both were eventually pardoned.
Prosecutors have argued, however, that Yoon's 2024 martial law attempt ""tarnished the nation's dignity far more severely"" than the military coup Chun and Roh staged in 1979.
Law professor Lim Ji-bong told the BBC ahead of the verdict that he expects the judge tohand down a life sentence to ""avoid making Yoon a martyr"". A death sentence carries political risk as it may further alienate Yoon's supporters and deepen chaos in the country, he said.
Even if he had been handed the death sentence, it would, in effect, be life imprisonment because South Korea has not executed anyone on death row since December 1997.
US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee believes Yoon will ultimately be pardoned, as Chun and Roh were.
""It's a customary thing about Korean politics,"" Lee said. ""Whatever the sentence, it's just a symbolic acknowledgement of how severe the crime is.""
In January, Yoon was found guilty of obstruction of justice by evading arrest; abuse of power by not convening a cabinet meeting before his martial law declaration; and falsifying official documents.
Prosecutors accused him of using state institutions ""for personal purposes"" to conceal wrongdoing and undermine constitutional checks and balances.
In January last year, it took some 3,000 police officers, over two attempts, to finally take Yoon into custody for questioning over the insurrection charge.
Yoon had mobilised a large group of security officers who formed a human wall inside his residence to block the arrest - a move that a special prosecutor investigating the charge said was unprecedented.
Yoon, meanwhile, argued the Corruption Investigation Office that attempted to arrest him lacked jurisdiction to investigate insurrection charges.
The chaos surrounding the arrest, and the earlier failed attempt, ""demonstrated apparent lawlessness by Yoon, [his] conservative party, and South Korea's domestic security institutions"", said Mason Richey, an associate professor at Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.
""The obstruction of justice trial is a way to ensure accountability for these,"" he said.
Prosecutors have also alleged that Yoon tried to provoke North Korea into attacking the South so as to justify his martial law declaration.
In putting forward this charge, the prosecution relied on evidence found on former military intelligence chief Yeo In-hyung's phone that contained words suggesting potential provocations. They also cited a memo which appeared to push for a move to ""create an unstable situation or seize an arising opportunity"".
This trial, which opened in January, will look at whether Yoon ordered drone flights into the North to induce military conflict between the Koreas, among other things.
Yeo and Yoon's former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun have also been indicted on the same charge.
Yoon has also been accused of perjury, for when he testified during former prime minister Han Duck-soo's trial last year on charges of aiding the insurrection.
Prosecutors allege that Yoon falsely testified by claiming he had long planned to hold a cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Investigators said Yoon had no such plan and only convened a meeting at Han's urging.
Apart from charges related to his martial law attempt, Yoon has also been indicted in a series of other cases.
He is among 33 people charged for allegedly obstructing an investigation into the death of a young marine officer in 2023, and for aiding the suspect in this case.
He has also been charged for meddling in the 2022 presidential elections and making false statements during his campaign.

Yoon Suk Yeol: The former South Korean leader jailed for life for leading an insurrection,2026-02-19T07:11:24.029Z," Koh Ewe

","It was an unexpected, late-night press conference which would set in motion the start of Yoon Suk Yeol's fall from presidential palace to prison cell.
The then-South Korean president appeared on television to declare martial law in December 2024, ordering the army to take control.
Within hours, it had been reversed by parliament, citizens and politicians alike rallying to defend the young democracy.
Yoon, meanwhile, found himself arrested, impeached and indicted for various charges in connection with the botched order.
Just over a year later, he has now been sentenced to life in prison. It is the 65-year-old politician's second conviction - he was jailed for five years in January for abusing power, obstructing justice and falsifying documents.
His martial law order and ensuing legal troubles have divided South Korea, with large crowds gathering against him as well as in support of him. The same was true as he was sentenced in February, when pro-Yoon crowds rallied outside the court in Seoul.
Influential right-wing YouTubers who support Yoon have long peddled conspiracy theories of stolen elections and anti-state Communist forces. And the former president himself channelled these into mainstream discourse, even citing unfounded claims of anti-state forces in the opposition to justify the martial law order.
He had said the opposition was ""trying to overthrow free democracy"".
But it soon became clear that he was motivated by his own political troubles.
Plagued by personal scandals and mounting pressure from the opposition, Yoon's popularity had been falling since he took office in 2022.
Yoon was a relative newcomer to politics when he won the presidency. He had risen to national prominence for prosecuting the corruption case against disgraced former President Park Geun-hye in 2016.
In 2022, the political novice narrowly beat his liberal opponent Lee Jae Myung by less than 1% of the vote - the closest result the country has seen since direct elections started to be held in 1987.
At a time when South Korean society was grappling with widening divisions over gender issues, Yoon appealed to young male voters by running on an anti-feminism platform.
People had “high hopes” for Yoon when he was elected, said Don S Lee, associate professor of public administration at Sungkyunkwan University. “Those who voted for Yoon believed that a new government under Yoon will pursue such values as principle, transparency and efficiency.”
Yoon has also championed a hawkish stance on North Korea. The communist state was cited by Yoon when he tried to impose martial law.
He said he needed to protect against North Korean forces and “eliminate anti-state elements”, even though it was apparent from the outset that his announcement was less about the threat from the North and more about his domestic woes.
Yoon is known for gaffes, which haven’t helped his ratings. During his 2022 campaign he had to walk back a comment that authoritarian president Chun Doo-hwan, who declared martial law and was responsible for massacring protestors in 1980, had been ""good at politics"".
Later that year he was forced to deny insulting the US Congress in remarks made after meeting US President Joe Biden in New York.
He was caught on a hot mic and seen on camera seemingly calling US lawmakers a Korean word that can be translated as ""idiots"" or something much stronger. The footage quickly went viral in South Korea.
Still, Yoon has had some success in foreign policy, notably improving ties in his country's historically fraught relationship with Japan.
Much of the scandal during Yoon's presidency centred around his wife Kim Keon Hee, who was accused of corruption and influence peddling, most notably allegedly accepting luxury bags from a pastor.
In November, Yoon apologised on behalf of his wife while rejecting calls for an investigation into her activities - a move that did little to help his wobbly approval ratings.
Yoon was relegated to a lame-duck president after the opposition Democratic Party won the parliamentary election by a landslide April 2024. The result was widely seen as a vote of no confidence on Yoon's time in office.
He also faced increasing pressure from his political opponents. In the lead-up to the martial law declaration, the opposition slashed the budget proposed by Yoon's ruling party and moved to impeach cabinet members for failing to investigate the first lady.
With his back against the wall, Yoon went for the nuclear option - a move that few, if any, could have predicted.
Many had worried about a political crisis ""because of the confrontation between the president and the opposition-controlled National Assembly"", said Celeste Arrington, director of The George Washington University Institute for Korean Studies. ""Though few predicted such an extreme move as declaring martial law.""
It was ""legal overreach and a political miscalculation"", said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.
""He sounded like a politician under siege,"" Dr Easley told the BBC.
""With extremely low public support and without strong backing within his own party and administration, the president should have known how difficult it would be to implement his late-night decree.""
Crisis engulfed Yoon's government in the wake of his martial law order. He was impeached, indicted over a series of charges in connection to it, and finally removed from office in April 2025.
His party paid the price too. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party's Lee Jae-myung won a landslide in the presidential election in June.
Top officials from his cabinet have since been either charged or convicted. Han Duck-soo, the prime minister who became acting president after Yoon was removed, has been jailed for 23 years for his part in the attempt, while former interior minister Lee Sang-min was handed a seven-year term.
In both cases, the courts recognised the declaration of martial law as an act of insurrection.
But even as the saga draws to a close, South Korea is reeling from the divisions that erupted in December 2024.
Although Yoon's People Power Party is in disarray, he still has a vocal support base, which some may argue has even strengthened because of his downfall.
His supporters, mainly young male voters and the elderly, often echo strong right-wing narratives and conspiracy theories, including that Yoon's party was a victim of election fraud. They also believe his declaration of martial law was necessary to protect the country.
Throughout the chaos, Yoon has projected what his critics see as defiance – or, as his supporters see it, determination.
While on trial for insurrection, Yoon defended his martial law order, calling it ""a measure to protect the freedom and sovereignty of the people and to preserve the nation and its constitution.""
He still faces two trials in connection with the failed martial law bid, and four others over corruption charges.

The teacher who won $1m for turning India's slums into open-air classrooms,2026-02-19T02:44:45.238Z," Cherylann Mollan
Mumbai
","A narrow lane in Mumbai city's upmarket Colaba area opens up to a patch of land filled with small concrete cubicles - nooks washermen use to clean and dry the city's laundry.
Surrounding the area are shanties painted in bright hues - red, blue, green and yellow - which sit one on top of the other like puzzle blocks in a lopsided Tetris game. The settlement is largely inhabited by washermen and their families, many of whom live and work there.
Tucked within the maze is a small learning centre offering free lessons in basic math and language skills, helping their children get a formal education for the first time, or return to it after dropping out from school.
The centre is run by a non-profit founded by Rouble Nagi, a 45-year-old artist who for three decades has worked to bring education to some of the city's most marginalised communities.
Earlier this month, Nagi received the Global Teacher Prize, a $1m award launched by the Varkey Foundation in collaboration with Unesco to recognise teachers who have made exceptional contributions to the profession.
Nagi was selected from among 5,000 nominations and applications from 139 countries, according to the Global Teacher Prize website.
It said that Nagi, through her non-profit organisation - the Rouble Nagi Art Foundation (RNAF) - had established ""more than 800 learning centres across India in over 100 underserved communities and villages"".
Nagi said her inspiration to take learning to the less-fortunate came about unexpectedly, about three decades ago, when a boy walked into one of her art workshops in Mumbai. She learnt that the child lived in a slum and could not afford to go to school.
Nagi says that the conversation motivated her to visit the boy's slum community and she offered to spruce up the locality by decorating the walls with murals.
""Children began to gather where we were painting. So, I asked them if they'd like to hear a story. They all said 'yes',"" Nagi recounts.
She said that's when she realised that children in poor communities wanted to learn and that she could spark their interest in education through art.
Over the years, Nagi and her team have set up learning centres in several cities across India, where teachers are encouraged to use art-based learning to simplify concepts. Volunteers are roped in to offer skill-based lessons and donations help children access books, bags and other school supplies.
Nagi explains that not all of the centres are brick-and-mortar classrooms. Sometimes, classes are held in an open area in a slum with students seated on mats and carpets.
""Learning can happen anywhere. You just have to make it interesting,"" Nagi says.
But running these centres is also challenging. Nagi says many of the children come from dysfunctional families and her teachers often have to double-up as their counsellors and protectors.
""If a child doesn't show up at one of our centres for a week, a volunteer visits their home to check on them,"" Nagi explains.
She adds that she also holds regular sessions with parents to keep them interested in their child's learning. This has helped many of her students complete their schooling and even pursue a college education after leaving the centre, she says.
One former student, Mayur, now runs his own art classes and a small printing business. At weekends, he volunteers with Nagi's foundation, hoping to give other children from the community the same opportunities he received.
""When you work in areas like these [slums], you have to build relationships not just with the students but the entire community. Whether that's through monetary help, supplying provisions in difficult times or offering a listening ear to someone who's overwhelmed. If we earn the trust and support of the community, we can continue our good work,"" Nagi explains.
She says she is also passionate about her foundation's 'Misaal' (meaning 'an example') project - which focuses on converting slums into ""open-air classrooms"" by painting educational murals on walls on topics ranging from science and hygiene to environmental awareness and social responsibility.
Nagi says these murals spark curiosity among residents and, in the long run, can also help bring about a change in people's behaviour and attitudes.
With the prize money, Nagi hopes to take her foundation's initiatives to more places in India, beginning with the federally-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir, where she grew up and now wants to build a skill-cum-learning centre, complete with computers.
Back in Colaba, huge murals and inspirational quotes cover the walls of shanties. The walls of the learning centre too are painted in bright colours and feature subjects ranging from plants to the animal kingdom.
Seven-year-old Khushi, a student at the centre, says she enjoys coming to ""school"" and dreams of becoming a teacher. Her mother, a domestic worker, is currently the family's sole earner.
Many of the other children come from similar economic backgrounds, but all nurture big ambitions for the future. And Nagi's schools hope to play a part in turning them into reality.

Indian university faces backlash for claiming Chinese robodog as own at AI summit,2026-02-18T11:16:28.905Z," Cherylann Mollan
Mumbai
","An Indian university has courted controversy at the AI summit in Delhi after an official claimed that a Chinese-made robotic dog was its own invention.
The incident came to light after a professor from Galgotias University told state-run broadcaster DD News that the robot named ""Orion"" was ""developed"" at their Centre of Excellence. A video of her remarks went viral.
Online users later identified the machine as the Go2 model made by Chinese firm Unitree Robotics, which is commercially available starting at about 200,000 rupees ($2,200; £1,600).
In a statement on Wednesday, the university denied claiming it had built the robot and described the backlash as a ""propaganda campaign"".
""We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn AI programming and develop and deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is need of the hour,"" the university said.
Neha Singh, the professor seen in the video, later told reporters her remarks had been misunderstood. ""It might be that I could not convey well what I wanted to say, or you could not understand well what I wanted to say,"" she said.
Social media users, however, accused the university of dishonesty.
Reports said that following the backlash, the university was asked to vacate its stall at the summit. Faculty members said they had received no official communication to do so.
But hours later, news agency Press Trust of India reported that electricity supply to the stall was cut off following the controversy.
A BBC reporter at the summit said the lights were turned off at the booth and no staff from the university were around.
The incident is being seen as an embarrassment for the organisers of the summit as the video had also been shared on IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw's official X account. The post has since been deleted.
India's IT Secretary S Krishnan said the controversy should not ""overshadow"" the work put in by other participants at the summit.
""What happened should not affect the way people present or exhibit their work at such events. The idea is not to use an opportunity like this to become something else or create unnecessary noise.
""It is essential that a proper code of conduct is followed. There are other countries and other participants involved as well,"" he told reporters.
The India AI Impact Summit, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Bharat Mandapam on Monday, is being pitched by the government as a flagship gathering to position India as a global AI hub.
Delegates from more than 100 countries, including several heads of governments, are attending, alongside industry leaders such as Sundar Pichai of Google.
The five-day summit features policy discussions, startup showcases and closed-door meetings on AI governance, infrastructure and innovation.
However, its opening day was overshadowed by complaints of overcrowding, long queues and confusion at the venue, prompting organisers to extend exhibition hours and tighten entry management. They say arrangements have since improved.
BBC correspondent Vikas Pandey, who is at the summit, said the venue was ""absolutely buzzing"" on the third day, with thousands of people from different parts of India visiting stalls and soaking up the excitement. Officials say they hope the event and the conversations around it will help adoption of AI across the country.

"Who is Tarique Rahman, the Bangladesh PM who spent 17 years in exile?",2026-02-18T00:51:51.261Z," Kathryn Armstrong
","Tarique Rahman was sworn in as Bangladesh's prime minister on 17 February after his centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) swept to a landslide in the general election.
Rahman, 60, is the figurehead of the influential Zia family, who leads one of two parties that have dominated politics in the country for decades. Both of his parents previously served as leaders of Bangladesh.
Yet it has been far from a smooth path to the top for Rahman, whose career has been dogged by allegations of nepotism and corruption by political rivals, as well as a long period of exile and his father's assassination when Rahman was a teenager.
His eventual ascent to chairman of the BNP came just weeks before Bangladesh headed to the polls, following the death of his mother, the country's first female prime minister Khaleda Zia.
""Peace, law and order must be maintained at any cost ... We will not tolerate any kind of chaos,"" Reuters reported Rahman saying as he was sworn in on Tuesday.
Forty-nine others, including experienced leaders and fresh faces, also took their oaths as members of the new cabinet.
Foreign dignitaries from India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, among other countries in the region, were present at the swearing-in ceremony.
Shafiqur Rahman of Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami is now the Leader of the Opposition.
Tarique Rahman first became active within the BNP in 2001, when he was in his mid-30s.
It was the start of his mother's second period as prime minister. Her first had run from 1991 to 1996. His father, Ziaur Rahman, a military ruler turned president, had been killed in a military coup in 1981. He was a leading figure in Bangladesh's struggle for independence and founded the BNP in 1978.
In 2002, Rahman took his first significant steps in his parents' footprints, when it was announced that he had been promoted to a senior position within the party.
At the time, the opposition described his rise as brazen nepotism. He would go on to acquire a reputation for being a ""hatchet man"" who enforced party discipline.
Rahman has also been accused in the past of using his power to gain personal advantages but has always denied the corruption allegations against him. Some of his supporters believe he was used as a political scapegoat by his opponents.
He was arrested on corruption charges in 2007 during a military-backed caretaker government and said he was tortured while awaiting trial. He spent 18 months in prison before being released and then left the country for London.
Reports at the time suggested that he had promised to leave politics in order to be allowed to leave Bangladesh.
Rahman would not return to his home country for another 17 years.
Yet despite living abroad, Rahman continued to shape BNP strategy and policies and had been the party's acting chairman since his mother was sentenced to prison in 2018.
He too was subject to various criminal investigations while Sheikh Hasina, toppled by mass protests in 2004, was in power and he was sentenced in absentia in numerous cases, including for his role in a deadly grenade attack on a political rally in 2004. He was later cleared of all charges.
He finally returned to Bangladesh on 25 December 2025. Five days later, his mother died.
On 9 January, he officially became the BNP's leader. Analysts say that his rise to leadership in the BNP was inevitable.
Accusations of nepotism once again reared their heads - something former BNP commerce minister Amir Khasru shrugged off.
""Whether you come from a dynasty or not is irrelevant,"" he told the BBC, arguing that the BNP's activities had been so stifled by the Hasina regime that the party had been unable to elect a new leader outside of the Zia family.
Others say the true test will be how Rahman leads his party and the country into the future.
""He [Rahman] has seen the dark corners of politics, as well as experienced the politics of conflict and revenge in this country. Whether he can use that political wisdom to move from being a party leader to becoming a leader of the country in the future remains to be seen,"" political analyst Mohiuddin Ahmed told the BBC.

Long queues and confusion mar first day of India's landmark AI summit,2026-02-17T09:54:34.492Z," Meryl Sebastian
","India's AI Impact Summit, billed as a landmark gathering of global leaders and technology executives, was overshadowed by logistical chaos on its opening day in Delhi on Monday.
Participants complained about long queues, overcrowding and confusion at the venue, saying they had to wait for hours. Some also reported limited access to food and water and said their products were stolen from their stall.
The five-day summit, inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi, is being promoted as the first major international AI meeting hosted in the Global South.
On Tuesday, India's Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw apologised to exhibitors for ""any issue or inconvenience"".
More than 100 countries are taking part, with technology leaders including Sam Altman of OpenAI and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc expected to attend.
Speaking at the inauguration, Modi said the summit showcased ""the extraordinary potential of AI, Indian talent and innovation"", adding that India aimed to shape solutions ""not just for India but for the world"".
Vaishnaw said the summit intended to look at both the benefits and harms of AI.
In the next few days, ""we are basically looking at and measuring what [AI's] impact on human society is going to be"", he said.
But the opening day was marred by complaints of poor crowd management at the summit venue Bharat Mandapam. By Monday afternoon, social media was flooded with complaints from founders, exhibitors and delegates who said security sweeps and last-minute closures left them stranded outside exhibition halls.
Maitreya Wagh, co-founder of voice AI start-up Bolna, wrote on X that he was unable to access his company's booth after gates were closed. Punit Jain, founder of tech platform Reskill, described ""7 AM queues"" followed by hours of waiting and a ""full evacuation"" before the prime minister's arrival.
Why India's AI summit is key to its future in tech
The tech bros might show more humility in Delhi – but will they make AI any safer?
Reuters reported that some speakers were still awaiting confirmation of their session timings, adding to concerns over mismanagement.
Dhananjay Yadav, founder of wearable AI start-up NeoSapiens, alleged that products from his company's stall were stolen at the venue. Writing on X, he said the firm had spent heavily on travel, accommodation and exhibition space, ""only to see our wearables disappear inside a high-security zone"".
Several attendees also complained about payment arrangements at food stalls inside the venue, saying food counters were accepting only cash and not digital payments, adding to the inconvenience, particularly for international visitors.
Soumya Sharma, founder of healthcare-focused Livo AI, said several discussions were held behind closed doors and that security shut down sessions because of overcrowding, preventing many delegates from taking part.
The closures, he suggested, undercut the summit's ambition to showcase India's AI ecosystem to a global audience.
While he said he attended some ""excellent sessions"", Sharma added that operational lapses risked overshadowing the substance of the event. ""Unless we get the basics right, we cannot claim to be utilising AI to its fullest,"" he wrote on X. ""AI is only part of the system. We must solve basic on-ground issues first.""
The BBC has reached out to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for a comment on these specifics.
The poor organisation of the event was acknowledged in a press conference on Tuesday by Minister Vaishnaw, who said ""a war-room"" had been set up at the summit to address any issues reported to them.
""About 70,000 people have attended the summit and we can say the organisation is very slow,"" he said. ""Whatever feedback you have, please share with us. We are working very hard to make this experience enjoyable for everyone,"" he added.

After the landslide: Can India reset ties with a BNP-led Bangladesh?,2026-02-15T01:23:34.211Z," Soutik Biswas
India correspondent
","When the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) swept to a landslide in the general elections on Friday, Delhi responded with studied warmth.
In a message posted in Bengali, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated BNP leader Tarique Rahman, the 60-year-old dynast, on a ""decisive victory"". He pledged India's support for a ""democratic, progressive and inclusive"" neighbour. He added that he looked forward to working closely to strengthen ""our multifaceted relationship"".
The tone was forward-looking - and careful. Since Sheikh Hasina fled to India after the Gen Z-led July 2024 uprising, ties between the neighbours have frayed, with mistrust hardening on both sides. Hasina's Awami League - the country's oldest party - was barred from contesting the election.
Many Bangladeshis fault Delhi for backing an increasingly authoritarian Hasina - a grievance layered atop older complaints over border killings, water disputes, trade curbs and incendiary rhetoric. Visa services are largely suspended, cross-border trains and buses halted, and flights between Dhaka and Delhi sharply reduced.
For Delhi, the question is not whether to engage a BNP government - but how: securing its red lines on insurgency and extremism while cooling rhetoric that has turned Bangladesh into a domestic political talking-point.
A reset is possible, say analysts. But it will require restraint - and reciprocity.
""The BNP, the most politically experienced and moderate of the parties in the fray, is India's safest bet moving forward. The question remains: how will Rahman govern the country? He is clearly seeking to stabilise India-Bangladesh ties. But this is easier said than done,"" says Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London.
For Delhi, the BNP is not an unknown entity.
When the party - under Rahman's mother Khaleda Zia - returned to power in 2001 in coalition with the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, ties with India cooled quickly. The BNP-Jamaat years were marked by turbulence and deep mutual mistrust.
Despite early courtesies - India's then national security adviser Brajesh Mishra was the first foreign dignitary to congratulate Khaleda Zia - trust proved thin. The apparent ease with which the BNP maintained relations with Washington, Beijing and Islamabad fed Delhi's suspicion that Dhaka was drifting strategically.
Two Indian red lines were soon tested: curbing support for north-eastern insurgents and protecting Hindu minorities.
Post-election attacks on Hindus in districts such as Bhola and Jessore alarmed Delhi. More damaging was the April 2004 seizure of 10 truckloads of weapons in Chittagong - the largest arms haul in Bangladesh's history - allegedly destined for Indian rebel groups. Economic ties fared little better. A proposed $3bn investment by Tata Group stalled over gas pricing and collapsed in 2008.
Ties kept deteriorating. In 2014, Zia - then in opposition - cancelled a scheduled meeting with then Indian president Pranab Mukherjee, citing security concerns, in what was widely seen as a snub to Delhi.
That uneasy history helps explain why India later invested so heavily in Sheikh Hasina.
In her 15 years in power, Hasina delivered what Delhi prizes most in its neighbourhood: security co-operation against insurgents, improved connectivity and a government broadly aligned with India rather than China - a partnership as strategically valuable as it was politically costly.
Now living in exile in Delhi, she faces a death sentence in absentia over the 2024 security crackdown - violence in which the UN says about 1,400 people were killed, most by security forces. India's refusal to extradite her has further complicated an already fraught reset with Dhaka.
Last month, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar travelled to Dhaka for Zia's funeral and used the occasion to meet Rahman. At a recent rally, the BNP leader declared: ""Not Dilli, not Pindi - Bangladesh before everything,"" signalling independence from Delhi and Pakistan's military headquarters in Rawalpindi.
Pakistan - India's nuclear-armed arch rival that was defeated in 1971 to secure Bangladesh's independence - remains a central, if sensitive, factor in the equation.
After Hasina's fall, Dhaka wasted little time in mending fences with Islamabad. A direct Dhaka-Karachi flight resumed last month after a 14-year hiatus. Earlier, there was a first visit by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years. Senior military officials have exchanged trips, security co-operation is back on the table, and trade climbed 27% in 2024-25.
The optics are unmistakable: a once-frosty relationship has thawed.
""What concerns us is not that Bangladesh has ties with Pakistan - as a sovereign country, it is entitled to,"" Smruti Pattanaik of the Delhi-based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, told the BBC. ""What was unusual was the near absence of engagement during Hasina's tenure. The pendulum had swung too far in one direction; now it risks swinging too far in the other.""
Hasina's continued exile is possibly the other, more serious irritant - in any reset.
""The BNP will have to reckon with the reality that Hasina is unlikely to be repatriated. At the same time, the opposition parties [in Dhaka] will keep up the pressure on the government to press India for her return - it's one of the few levers they have to challenge the BNP on foreign policy,"" says Pattanaik.
It is not going to be easy.
Thousands of Awami League rank-and-file members have reportedly crossed into India after the 2024 July uprising.
""If Delhi seeks to rehabilitate the Awami League from its soil, it will be fraught - Hasina's pre-election press conferences [from exile] were baffling. Unless she signals contrition or steps aside to allow a leadership transition, her continued presence risks complicating ties,"" says Sreeradha Datta, a professor of international affairs at the OP Jindal Global University.
Then there is the cross-border rhetoric - inflammatory commentary from Indian politicians and television studios that has fed a wider belief in Bangladesh that Delhi sees it less as a sovereign equal than as a pliant backyard.
As Paliwal notes, the ""new normal"" will hinge on whether Dhaka's new leadership can contain anti-India sentiment - and whether Delhi can dial down its own charged messaging, seen recently in moves such as barring a Bangladeshi cricketer from the Indian Premier League.
""If they fail - wittingly or unwittingly - then the situation will remain in the 'managed rivalry' bucket,"" he says.
To be sure, security co-operation remains the ballast in an otherwise choppy relationship.
India and Bangladesh conduct annual military exercises, co-ordinated naval patrols, annual defence dialogues and operate a $500m Indian line of credit for defence purchases.
""I don't think the BNP will roll back that co-operation. This is a new leader, a different coalition - and a party returning after 17 years,"" says Pattanaik.
For all the turbulence, geography and economics bind the two: a 4,096km (2,545-mile) border, deep security and cultural links. Bangladesh is India's biggest trading partner in South Asia, and India has become Bangladesh's largest export market in Asia.
Estrangement is untenable - but the frayed ties still demand a reset.
""India's past relationship with the BNP is complex and marked by mistrust more than understanding,"" says Paliwal. ""But given the geopolitical circumstances today, the fact that Rahman has shown political maturity to not let the past become an enemy of the future, and that Delhi is open to pragmatic engagement are promising signs.""
The question is who moves first.
""India should take the initiative as the big neighbour. India should do the outreach. Bangladesh has held a robust election; now engage, see where we can help. I'm hopeful the BNP has learnt the lessons of the past,"" says Datta.
In other words, the reset may depend less on rhetoric and more on whether the bigger neighbour chooses confidence over caution.

Is this a 'very Chinese time in your life'? The trend boosting China's soft power,2026-02-14T23:11:56.199Z," Koh Ewe
","Ni hao, we're all Chinese now.
Or at least that's what they claim on TikTok, where a trend called ""Chinamaxxing"" has taken off in the West.
Chinese wellness practices, once associated with the tacky and geriatric, have suddenly found themselves in vogue, largely among Americans.
From warm apple-boiled water to indoor slippers and longevity exercises, people are sharing videos of themselves ""learning to be Chinese"". Many come with the Fight Club-inspired caption ""you met me at a very Chinese time in my life"", or the hashtag #newlychinese.
As Donald Trump shakes up the world order, the Chinese Communist Party has welcomed this boost to the country's image.
Chinamaxxing is certainly adding more gloss to the recent flourish of Chinese soft power. Over the past year we've seen the world clamour for Labubu dolls, wait in line at brand new stores to buy Mixue bubble tea and Luckin coffee, and scroll through their friends' holiday feeds in the ""cyberpunk city"" of Chongqing.
Some say Chinamaxxing stems from young Americans' disenchantment with their own country, although it's unclear how much that is really driving the trend.
But like so many internet trends, this one hardly paints the full picture. It's a celebration of memes and fleeting moments that make up just one slice of Chinese life. Beyond that are young people who, like their American counterparts, are also worried about their future in a sluggish economy and a fast-changing world.
Some Chinese youth may find it strange that parts of their culture - long seen as ""uncool"" in the Western imagination - are now the object of fascination. Some may find it offensive that Westerners on TikTok are facetiously claiming they've been ""diagnosed as Chinese"".
But others say Chinamaxxing strikes a different note from derogatory jokes like ""bing chilling"" - where the punchline is ex-wrestler John Cena's stilted Mandarin pronunciation - or the ""social credit"" meme that mocks the Chinese government's restrictions on personal freedoms.
This time, Chinese people are in on the joke - not the butt of it.
One of the most influential figures behind the Chinamaxxing meme is Sherry Zhu, a Chinese-American TikTok content creator who regularly shares traditional wellness tips with her ""Chinese baddies"".
""Tomorrow you're turning Chinese,"" she tells her 740,000 TikTok followers. ""And I know that sounds intimidating, but there is no point in fighting it now.""
Few could have seen this coming.
It was not that long ago when the Covid pandemic sparked a wave of Sinophobia. Chinese diaspora spoke of racism and how people were avoiding the community and their businesses.
Then a stunned world watched Beijing put its cities into hellish lockdowns. Reports emerged of residents running out of food and pleading for help from inside their sealed-off neighbourhoods. The restrictions ended only in early 2023 after rare protests. By then expats had left China in droves, many of them saying too much had changed.
There was also an exodus from Hong Kong, where Beijing's control was reshaping the city. This, along with China's growing power and assertiveness, strained the relationship with the West, even as the world's reliance on the Chinese economy became clear.
Meanwhile, China's investments in tech, infrastructure and exports began to pay off - and became more visible as it reopened post pandemic, relaxing visa rules to bring back tourists.
It was hard to miss: glitzy skyscrapers, a sprawling high-speed rail network, highways packed with electric vehicles, and a boom in green energy, robotics and artificial intelligence. Chongqing - a humid southwestern metropolis which once made global headlines for a corruption scandal and murder - turned popular and cool.
There have been other, smaller triumphs. Young people around the world are snatching Adidas Tang-style jackets off the shelves, bingeing on Chinese micro-dramas and experimenting with powdery make-up looks flaunted by Chinese girls and women on Douyin, China's version of TikTok.
""As a Chinese person who has been online throughout years and years of heavy Sinophobia, it felt refreshing to have the mainstream opinion finally shift regarding China,"" Claire, a Chinese-Canadian TikTok user, tells BBC Chinese.
The 22-year-old, who shares political content on TikTok and would only reveal her first name for that reason, says, for her, the ""critical juncture"" was last year.
That was when she noticed a shift in attitudes about China. A wave of Americans arrived on RedNote, a popular Chinese social media app, ahead of a TikTok ban in the US.
Within days memes became the currency of these American ""TikTok refugees"" as two worlds that rarely interact because of China's internet firewall were brought closer.
""These young people have watched their physical reality remain frozen while China built entire cities,"" says Afra Wang, a tech writer and podcaster.
""When you can't build high-speed rail but you can scroll through videos of Chinese infrastructure, of course the future starts to look Chinese.""
For observers like her, it's no coincidence that Chinamaxxing comes as the American Dream seems to be dimming.
Americans who came of age after the Iraq War, the 2008 global financial crisis or even the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot face a job market disrupted by globalisation and then AI, Wang says: ""American exceptionalism was never something they lived.""
What do people in China think of Chinamaxxing? Not much, it seems. The trend has stirred limited reactions on Chinese social media.
Rather, in the eyes of Chinese people, America, once seen as a beacon of success, has lost its shimmer. Not least because tensions between the two sides have made it harder for Chinese students who want to study or work there.
""During America's Chinamaxxing moment, China is experiencing its own America-minimising moment,"" Wang says.
On parts of Chinese social media, there are dystopian references to the ""US kill line"", a Chinese gaming term that refers to the perilous descent into poverty in the US. The idea, which took root quickly among users and influencers, is that America is a tough place to survive because a single stroke of bad luck can derail your life.
The term's popularity on social media is helped by the fact that it has been embraced by Chinese state media and the government. They have sought to portray the US as a decaying superpower because of inequality, a weak social safety net and a broken healthcare system.
According to a commentary in state-owned Xinhua, the ""kill line"" meme ""underscores how far the lived reality can drift from the ideals once broadcast to the world"".
It's little wonder that Chinese authorities are pleased with Chinamaxxing.
""Chinese lifestyles increasingly gain global appeal, offer a steadier way of being,"" reads the headline of a Global Times piece about the trend.
When asked about it at a press briefing earlier this month, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said a ""unique blend of history and modernity"" is making China increasingly appealing to foreigners.
He was ""happy"" to see foreigners experiencing the ""everyday life of ordinary Chinese people"".
Are they really?
For one, it's hard to know what Chinese people make of so many things because all public conversation and activity is heavily policed. Criticising the government is risky and protests are quickly quashed.
Two, there is a lot the memes making it to the West don't show. China's youth are facing an unemployment rate that sits at more than 15% and burning out from a gruelling work culture, yet sharing too much of their pessimism online could alert internet censors. They are worried about finding a home as the country's property crisis continues, and dating is no easier than anywhere else.
Propping up breakneck delivery speeds are gig workers scrambling to hit deadlines. Many can relate to the hustle: in 2023, Beijing courier Hu Anyan's memoir about the relentless nature of gig work became a national bestseller.
""When I think of my American friends and tech people wandering through Shenzhen in awe, I also think of my own experience in Shenzhen,"" Wang says. ""Drinking a six yuan latte from Luckin Coffee, delivered on a scooter by someone like Hu Anyan, whose labour makes 'cool China' visible while remaining almost invisible themselves.""
Perhaps, if the fascination with China's successes continues, more of Chinese life will surface. But for now apple tea seems to be where it's at.
""Ever since I started boiling apples in my tea water my period cramps have completely gone,"" reads a comment on RedNote from an American user - one of the TikTok refugees still lingering on the app.
""We have so much still left to learn being Chinese.""

Why writer Arundhati Roy's cult classic film is still relevant in India,2026-02-14T01:45:02.976Z," Zoya Mateen
Delhi
","On a sticky Delhi afternoon in the late 1980s, a group of architecture students loiter, argue and dream their way through a city that seems permanently unfinished.
They are idealistic and impatient, fluent in slogans and sarcasm, and astutely aware that the system they are training to enter may have no particular use for them.
This is the world of In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, the 1989 television film written by Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy and directed by Pradip Krishen.
Nearly four decades after it first aired on India's state broadcaster Doordarshan, a restored version of the film is set to receive its world premiere in the Berlinale Classics section of the 2026 Berlin International Film Festival.
The Film Heritage Foundation, which initiated its restoration, will also release the film in select theatres across India in March, pricing tickets low to attract younger viewers.
""We wanted it to be accessible,"" said Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, filmmaker and Director at Film Heritage Foundation. ""It's a significant film. In its dialogue, in its portrayal of college life, in the kinds of characters it foregrounded - it achieved something unusual.""
Often described as India's first English-language feature, Annie occupies a singular place in the country's cinema history: local in texture yet cosmopolitan in voice; modest in scale yet exacting in its writing.
Made on a modest budget, the film follows a ragtag group of final-year students at Delhi's School of Planning and Architecture as they drift, stall and inch toward graduation.
Its title comes from a Delhi University slang: to ""give it those ones"" is to perform one's usual act - bungles included.
At its centre is Anand ""Annie"" Grover, an endearing fifth-year student suspended between idealism and chronic distraction.
He keeps hens in his hostel room and dreams up improbable schemes to transform India - including planting trees along railway tracks, fertilised by waste from passing trains. Four years earlier, he scrawled a crude joke about the dean in the men's toilet; he has failed every exam since.
Around him orbits a constellation of classmates - caustic, thoughtful, restless - who debate Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, Karl Marx and the price of cigarettes with equal seriousness.
Roy herself appears as Radha, sharp and self-possessed. The ensemble cast also includes a young Shah Rukh Khan - it was the Bollywood star's screen debut.
What stands out in Annie is its relaxed, unvarnished portrait of student life: messy hostel rooms, friends lounging on charpoys smoking and arguing about everything from bureaucracy to exams, and a breezy irreverence toward authority.
Students treat institutional rituals as a farce and openly mock their principal - calling him Yamdoot after the Hindu god of death - a blustering figure who addresses them as ""My dear donkey"".
Radha, Roy's character, embodies the film's carefree defiance. She smokes beedis (hand-rolled cheap Indian cigarettes) and dresses boldly, pairing a sari with a rakish hat, capturing the free-spirited energy of the campus.
In her memoir Mother Mary Comes to Me, Roy explains that the script grew out of ""the wacky anarchy of that campus, the stoned, bombed-out students and the dialect of English that we spoke - an inventive mix of Hindi and English"".
The response to the film was electric.
At its first screening in Delhi, Roy recalls that ""students jammed into the hall and crowded on to the floor. Within a few minutes the audience began to yell, roar with laughter and wolf-whistle through the film. They recognised themselves, their language, their clothes, their jokes, their silliness.""
Beyond its campus setting, Annie captures a moment when Indian cinema - and state broadcasters - were relatively permissive about youth culture, language and social critique.
In the late 1980s, television allowed more room for satire and student life than it does today. In the decades since, films challenging social norms or scrutinising institutions have more often faced resistance from the censors.
When Annie was first released, it won two National Awards - for best screenplay and best English-language feature - but largely vanished after its television premiere, a quiet late-night screening on Doordarshan.
Its reputation, however, quietly grew.
Bootleg recordings circulated among architecture students and cinephiles, who came to regard it as one of the few credible English-language Indian films of its time.
""Nobody had really made a film about English-speaking students in India,"" Dungarpur said. ""Audiences weren't used to hearing English spoken so casually. But that's how students in [some] colleges speak to each other. Annie captured that without self-consciousness.""
He adds that audiences also recognised the mood of a country on the cusp of economic liberalisation, when a government job could represent both security and suffocation. The debates staged in the film - about hierarchy, bureaucracy and institutional power - remain familiar.
""The issues the film speaks about are still prevalent,"" Dungarpur said. ""That's why it resonates. It hasn't dated in the way you might expect.""
The restoration of the film began almost by accident. While moving house, Krishen discovered trunks of scripts and papers and was about to junk them before a friend alerted Dungarpur, who retrieved the material and later proposed restoring Annie.
The process required painstaking, almost forensic, effort. Colours had faded; the soundtrack posed its own challenges.
""There's a scene towards the end where Roy is wearing a red sari,"" Dungarpur said. ""In the surviving print, the red had almost disappeared. We had to ask: what kind of red was it?""
Seen now, Annie feels almost like a prelude to Roy's later life as a feted novelist and one of India's most polarising writers. And yet, the film is lighter on its feet than her later reputation might suggest. It jokes. It rambles. It allows its characters to be foolish and tender.
As Roy has said in a recent interview, its dissent lies in its ""tone rather than in slogans"".
""Students were rebelling, but with hope and celebration, not anger. The film was about people finding joy in being themselves and saying we don't want to conform,"" says Krishen in the same interview.
As it returns to the screen, younger viewers may glimpse another era - flared trousers, drafting tables, cigarette smoke curling under fluorescent lights.
But they may also recognise something more enduring: the persistence of the very systems the film gently mocks.
""They'll see how cool that time was,"" Dungarpur said. ""But they'll also see how much of it feels familiar.""

Can Bangladesh's new leader bring change after election landslide?,2026-02-14T00:03:33.665Z," Yogita Limaye
South Asia and Afghanistan correspondent
Dhaka
","Just over two years ago, when Sheikh Hasina won an election widely condemned as rigged in her favour, it was hard to imagine her 15-year grip on power being broken so suddenly, or that a rival party that had been virtually written off would make such a resounding comeback.
But in the cycle of Bangladeshi politics, this is one more flip-flop between Hasina's Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which have alternated holding power for decades.
Except this is the first time that new BNP leader Tarique Rahman is formally leading the party - and the first time he's contested an election.
His mother Khaleda Zia, who died of an illness late last year, was the party's head for four decades. She took over after his father, Ziaur Rahman, the BNP founder and a key leader of Bangladesh's war for independence, was assassinated.
Accused of benefitting from nepotism when his mother was in power, Tarique Rahman has also faced allegations of corruption. Five days before his mother died he returned to Bangladesh after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London.
And while Rahman, 60, has on occasion been the de-facto chair of an emaciated BNP when his mother was jailed and more recently when she was ill, he's largely seen as an untested leader.
""That he doesn't have prior experience probably works for him, because people are willing to give change a chance,"" says political scientist Navine Murshid. ""They want to think that new, good things are actually possible. So there is a lot of hope.""
The party says its first priority is to bring democracy back to Bangladesh.
""All the democratic institutions [and] financial institutions, which have been destroyed over the last decade, we have to first put those back in order,"" senior BNP leader Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury told the BBC shortly after the election was called.
Bangladesh has a long history of such promises being made and broken, with parties becoming increasingly authoritarian once they come to power.
But this time, the country's young, who came out in the ""July uprising"" of 2024 that ousted Hasina, appear less tolerant of accepting more of the same.
""We don't want to fight again,"" says Tazin Ahmed, a 19-year-old who participated in the uprising.
""The stepping down of the previous prime minister was not the victory. When our country runs smoothly without any corruption, and the economy becomes good, that will be our main victory.""
Her cousin Tahmina Tasnim, 21, says: ""The first thing we want is unity among the people. We have the right to a stable nation and a stable economy. We have been part of an uprising and we know how to fight back. So if the same things start again, we will have the right to do it again.""
Since Hasina was ousted, violence has marred the tenure of Bangladesh's interim leader Mohammad Yunus.
Getting a grip on law and order will need to be a key priority for the new government. Reviving the economy, reducing food prices and creating jobs for Bangladesh's large young population are other massive challenges.
Sociologist Samina Luthfa says the lack of experience of running a government affects all parties.
For the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, which has been banned twice in Bangladesh's history, including under Hasina, this is its first time winning a sizeable number of seats.
Its alliance partner, the National Citizens Party (NCP), formed by some of the students who led the uprising, has won six seats in its debut performance.
""We are going to see leaders in the parliament who have never been to the parliament before,"" Luthfa says.
""NCP youngsters have a lot to learn. The others are seasoned politicians but they do not have the experience of running the country. So it's going to be an uphill task.""
Jamaat's manifesto was secular and development-focused, making no mention of Islamic law.
But its website reads: ""Jamaat performs in political arena because Islamic law can't be implemented without political force"", which has always led to questions about what the party would do if it ever came to power.
Murshid says Jamaat's performance in this election is unsurprising.
""Jamaat is a very organised political party. For the last several decades, they have worked relentlessly at the grassroots level,"" she says.
""I think that has to be recognised but, of course, the problematic part is that they are inherently anti-democratic, misogynistic and patriarchal.""
Luthfa says all parties have let the women of Bangladesh down. Just over 4% of candidates were women.
""We the women who were part of the July uprising - all political parties have failed to translate our collective agency into a more formal political, electoral arena,"" she says.
""Parliament members now need to make haste so that they can bring in skilled, honest and deserving candidates to the seats reserved for women in parliament.""
Of the 350 seats in Bangladesh's parliament, 300 are elected and the remaining 50 are reserved for women who are nominated by political parties in proportion to their electoral performance.
While this election was starkly different from the past few polls under Hasina – being genuinely competitive, with the outcome not known before polling began - the barring of her party from the election has cast a shadow over its credibility.
Given its claims of reviving democracy, when asked if it would support bringing the Awami League back into the political fold, senior BNP leader Chowdhury said: ""It is not for us to decide.
""For the Awami League to come back to the electoral process in Bangladesh, it's going to take a while, because their credibility is in question. When you are accused of killing your own people, of atrocities, persecution, then the people will decide where they fit in in the future of Bangladesh politics.""
From her exile in India, Hasina has termed Thursday's poll an ""election of deception and farce"" and has called for a fresh election in which the Awami League is allowed to participate.
At the moment, public anger against her party is intense, but given Bangladesh's political history, it would be premature to write off the Awami League forever.

British couple held by Taliban describe 'culture shock' returning to UK,2026-02-13T22:24:34.518Z," Katie Razzall
","A British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for seven-and-a-half months have described a ""huge culture shock"" after returning to the UK.
Peter, 80, and his wife Barbie Reynolds, 76, said they were never told why they were being held, nor why they were released in September.
The couple, who have run a charity programme in Afghanistan for almost two decades, told BBC Newsnight the last five months in the UK have been ""totally different"".
""What we've been through changes us. What we've been through in the last, well decades, but also obviously last year, it reshapes you,"" said Barbie.
""You think differently and you see things differently than we did when we used to live here before.""
While living in their long-term home in Afghanistan's Bamiyan province, Barbie said she wore a Hijab at all times and was not allowed out in public without her husband.
""The freedom here is very striking; people are free to wear what they want, go where they want,"" she said.
They were arrested on 1 February 2025 after taking a chartered flight from Kabul to Bamiyan province, along with friend Faye Hall and their translator who were later released.
The Taliban said the pair had broken Afghan laws and were released after judicial proceedings - but has never disclosed the reason for their detention.
They were released through Qatari mediation but Peter said the reason for their detention was ""a complete mystery"".
The couple, who married in Kabul in 1970, previously said they were detained in 10 different prisons and at one point thought they would be executed.
""I wasn't sure whether Barbie was alive,"" Peter said.
Barbie said she shared a prison block with 240 women but there were ""many more blocks with women, with 40 children"".
""It was cramped, there were about seven toilets for that number of people. They tried to fix the showers but they broke again and the drains were always overflowing,"" she said.
During Ramadan, Barbie had one meal a day but after Ramadan, they were given the same amount of food but just divided at lunchtime and dinner.
""I became very malnourished and I got anaemia - Peter said I aged 20 years when I next saw him,"" she said.
""Sometimes I could hardly walk and I became really quite poorly.""
Taliban officials maintained the pair received adequate medical care during their detention and that their human rights were respected.
One of the prisons Peter and Barbie were held in was Pul-e-Charkhi, a notorious maximum security prison outside Kabul that is home to some of the most dangerous criminals.
At one point they were held in basement cells with no windows for two months. For the final weeks of their detention they were moved above ground, where they say they had access to better food and were treated with kindness.
Peter said he was ""shocked"" when he saw Barbie after months apart.
""She was no longer a 76-year-old, she was in her 90s,"" he said, adding that his wife was unable to steady herself to walk.
They previously said they wished to ""hug"" the people who decided to jail them and forgive them.
""I'd want them to know I'm not holding a grudge against them,"" Peter said.
He added that he would love still to work with the government of Afghanistan ""for the good of the people of the country"".
They sent a message to Craig and Lindsay Foreman, who were arrested and detained in Iran in January 2025.
""Hang in there, don't lose your hope,"" said Barbie.

","The centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has secured a landslide majority in parliament, 18 months after mass protests ousted the country's longest-serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
The party took more than two-thirds of seats in the historic general election, with Jamaat, the country's main Islamist party, coming second. Hasina's Awami League was banned from taking part.
BNP leader Tarique Rahman is set to be the next prime minister and faces huge challenges in getting the economy back on its feet and restoring democracy after 15 years of authoritarian rule under Hasina.
Voters also backed sweeping democratic reforms in a referendum held alongside the election.
""I am grateful for the love you have shown me,"" Raman told well-wishers in Dhaka as he attended Friday prayers.
His party said there would be no victory procession and he urged supporters to attend prayers instead of street celebrations in memory of his late mother, former PM Khaleda Zia, who died in December.
His formal election as the country's new leader will happen after new MPs are sworn in, which is expected to take place on Saturday.
Rahman's family background - his late father was also a leader of Bangladesh - is a reminder that while the BNP have promised change, Rahman, like Hasina, hails from a political dynasty.
The absence of both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, who alternated in power over four decades, was one of a number of firsts in this election.
Another was that, with the Awami League banned, Jamaat for the first time ran as one of the main parties vying for power. The alliance it leads took 77 seats, six of which went to the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) born out of the 2024 protests.
The Awami League has questioned the legitimacy of the election given that it was unable to participate, while Jamaat has questioned the way the vote was conducted. Both it and the BNP have accused the other of voting irregularities.
For Rahman, it is a huge change of fortunes. He spent 17 years in self-imposed exile in London before returning to the country five days before his mother's death and is seen by many as largely untested.
As well as being on track to become the country's next leader, is also his first time as an MP. He was elected as member for the Dhaka-17 and Bogra-6 constituencies, and is one of 212 successful BNP candidates, according to the Election Commission, which put voter turnout at 59.44%.
During his campaign, Rahman promised that Bangladesh's democracy would be restored.
Reviving the country's economy, bringing rising food prices under control and creating jobs for its huge young population are the big challenges facing the new government.
Repairing strained ties with giant neighbour India is also high on the list of priorities.
Within hours of his win, Rahman had received a call from India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi who congratulated him on a ""remarkable victory"".
""As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India's continued commitment to the peace, progress, and prosperity of both our peoples,"" Modi wrote on X.
Although the BNP are promising to lead change in the country, the party was criticised for corruption and accused of human rights violations when it was last in government in the early 2000s.
Rahman himself was subject to various criminal investigations while Sheikh Hasina was in power but was later cleared of all charges.
Thursday's democratic exercise is a moment of huge potential - and risk - for the country, with one of its two main parties winning such a big victory.
Among the constitutional reforms envisaged are prime ministerial term limits, a directly elected upper parliamentary house, stronger presidential powers and increased judicial independence.
Greater representation of women in parliament is also in the charter but only a tiny number of female candidates were successful in the election, showing there is a long way to go.
Of the main parties, the BNP fielded 10 female candidates, the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) just two and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami none.
Both the BNP and Jamaat have denied sidelining women, instead claiming the number of those standing was a result of Bangladesh's ""social structure"".
One voter, Shima Akhter, was among many women who took part in the student-led protests leading to Hasina's downfall - paving the way for the election - and dismissed this as ""just a patriarchal excuse"".
Rahman will be under great scrutiny to deliver for Akhter and other young people like her who are hungry for change as Bangladesh has one of the youngest demographics in the world.
While there may be mixed feelings among some about the election result and concerns over whether the BNP can deliver, Rashna Mahzabin is among those who are happy they got to ""raise their voices"" after years of authoritarian rule.
""That's a huge win,"" she told the BBC.

AirAsia accused by artist for allegedly using his work without consent,2026-02-13T07:52:56.968Z," Osmond Chia
Business reporter
","An artist based in Malaysia has sued budget airline AirAsia and its parent company Capital A Berhad for allegedly using designs on a plane without his consent.
In his lawsuit, Ernest Zacharevic, a Lithuanian-born artist based in Penang, claims that his 2012 street mural, Kids on Bicycle, has been ""reproduced and displayed"" as part of a livery on an aircraft operated by the Malaysian airline in late 2024.
""This was done without my consent, authorisation, or licensing arrangement,"" he alleges, adding that the livery was removed after he had publicly raised concerns about its use.
The BBC has contacted AirAsia for comment.
Speaking to the BBC on Thursday, Zacharevic said he became aware in October 2024 that an AirAsia plane had displayed a livery with artwork that appeared similar to his paintings.
The artist has been based in Malaysia for more than a decade and is known for his road-side murals in Penang.
One of Zacharevic's most well-known work is Kids on Bicycle, a street mural he painted as part of an art commission for a local festival in 2012. The mural, located in the heritage district of George Town, depicts two laughing children on a real bicycle, positioned to look part of the painting.
Tourists can often be seen taking pictures with the mural, now an icon in Penang.
Zacharevic said his work had been ""unlawfully reproduced"" on AirAsia's aircraft without his knowledge or consent and displayed publicly on a plane in operation - one that he saw with his own eyes at an airport.
""It felt a little offensive,"" Zacharevic said, recalling the moment in 2024.
He posted a picture of the plane on social media, tagging the airline and saying that they needed to have a conversation about the use of the artwork.
Since then, he has held talks with the company, though neither side has been able to settle on terms, he said.
Zacharevic said this was not the first time his work had been used in connection to AirAsia's campaigns and products, accusing the airline of using his artwork on a delivery bag for its food services arm.
According to the court documents, Zacharevic said he held discussions with AirAsia in 2017 about an offer to make art for the airline's jets and a mural in one of its offices.
He alleges that the airline was made fully aware of his work and business rates at the time, according to the documents.
The claim adds that in spite of this, the ""the airline proceeded to reproduce and publicly display one of the plaintiff's principal works in a prominent setting, thereby wilfully infringing the plaintiff's copyright and moral rights"".
Malaysia's AirAsia is the largest low-cost carrier in Asia, operating more than 200 jets to more than 100 destinations. This week, it unveiled plans to resume flights from Kuala Lumpur to London via Bahrain, marking a return to the British capital after more than a decade.
Zacharevic said he is leaving it to the court to decide the amount of any compensation he is entitled to.
The artist said: ""I wish to be clear about one thing. I do not accept any characterisation of this use as merely a reference to cultural or geographical associations.
""The artwork in question is a distinct artistic creation. It is not a natural or generic feature, but the result of many years of professional training, skill and labour.""

The Hindu who stood up for a Muslim and became a hero,2026-02-13T03:26:25.759Z," Geeta Pandey & Asif Ali
Kotdwar
","""My name is Mohammad Deepak.""
With these five simple words, a Hindu man who stood up for a Muslim shopkeeper has been catapulted to fame and become an unlikely hero in India.
Deepak Kumar has been praised as an ""icon for secular India"" and a ""posterboy for India's pluralism"". At the same time, he has faced noisy protests, been called a traitor to his Hindu faith and received death threats.
The incident that thrust him into the spotlight took place on 26 January in the small town of Kotdwar in the northern state of Uttarakhand. It has made headlines since a video recording of the incident went viral.
It shows the 42-year-old gym owner arguing with activists of Bajrang Dal, a hardline Hindu group that routinely makes news for harassing Muslims.
Deepak said he was at a friend's shop next door and intervened when he saw about half a dozen men heckling Vakeel Ahmed, the elderly owner of a clothing store called ""Baba School Dress and Matching Centre"". They were telling him to drop Baba from his 30-year-old shop's name.
Baba is a commonly used term in India to refer to mystics and religious gurus and also to fathers or grandfathers by both Hindus and Muslims.
The Bajrang Dal activists, however, insisted that Baba in Kotdwar could only be a reference to Siddhabali Baba - a local temple to Hindu god Hanuman - and that a Muslim had no right to use it in his shop's name.
Ahmed's son is heard pleading with them for more time, but they are told it must be done soon.
That's when Deepak walked in on the scene - drawn by ""a lot of people crowding in front of the shop"", he later told BBC Hindi.
""Are Muslims not citizens of India?"" he is heard asking in the video.
Deepak said his intervention was spontaneous and not part of a strategy. ""I did not like these young men talking so rudely with an elderly man. They were targeting him because of his religion. They were targeting Muslims.""
Ahmed, 68, says it's difficult to say what would have happened if Deepak hadn't been there. ""We were scared. They could go to any extent to get their point across.""
After the push back from Deepak, the Bajrang Dal activists asked his name.
""By identifying myself as Mohammad Deepak, I wanted to tell them that I'm an Indian. That this is India and everyone has the right to stay here, regardless of their religion,"" he said.
Surprised by this unusual cobbling together of Hindu and Muslim names, the vigilantes left. But a few days later, more than 150 Bajrang Dal supporters turned up to protest outside Deepak's gym.
Following a complaint from Ahmed, the police registered a case against ""some unknown people"". They also registered a case against Deepak after a complaint from two Hindu activists.
The protest and the police action have made headlines in India. Coming at a time when unprovoked attacks on Muslims by Hindu mobs have become routine, Deepak's confronting of the vigilantes is being hailed as a rare act of heroism.
Congress party MP Rahul Gandhi has described him as ""a hero of India"" who is ""fighting for the constitution and humanity"". Deepak is spreading ""love in the marketplace of hate"", he posted on X, adding that ""we need more Deepaks - those who don't bend, don't fear and who stand with full strength with the constitution"".
An article in the Indian Express said the video provided ""lots of hope"".
""Deepak's words come as a shot in the arm in a society that often seems to have been overtaken by hatred and intolerance. They remind us that this is the 'real India', where everyone has the right to live and breathe as they please, and name their shop whatever they fancy,"" the report said.
Many others also took to social media to express solidarity with Deepak and commended him for standing up to bullies. His phone has been ringing non-stop, and he's been much sought-after by journalists, photographs and other visitors.
His follower count on Instagram has swelled and a short video he shared on 29 January has more than five million likes. In it, he says: ""I am not a Hindu, I am not a Muslim, I am not a Sikh, I am not a Christian. First and foremost, I am a human being.""
Deepak is now trying to come to terms with his newfound fame and says he never imagined that a simple intervention would become such a big issue.
""I simply did what I thought was right. I never thought the matter would become so big. But now it's become national news,"" he said.
His act of bravery, however, is not without consequence.
Deepak has faced backlash with critics calling him a traitor to his faith and leaving abusive messages on social media. He's received numerous death threats - on Wednesday, he posted on X a recording of one such threatening phone call.
""Bajrang Dal shouldn't have spared you… I'll teach you a lesson soon,"" the caller tells him.

Deepak says the attention has left his family ""traumatised"". ""They are afraid. And I'm under a lot of mental pressure now.""
His once thriving gym is now largely deserted, bringing financial worries in its wake.
""I used to have more than 150 people coming to train here daily. That number has now dwindled to 15. A lot of people are not coming because they are afraid,"" he said.
Last weekend, opposition MP John Brittas, who visited Deepak, called him ""a beacon of hope in the struggle against the Hindutva communalism"" and said he had taken ""a membership at his gym, which now stands deserted due to threats from communal elements"".
As news of Deepak's financial woes spread, people from across India offered to buy his gym membership because, as an X post by Joy Das said, ""We can't let a good man lose.""
Despite the threats and worries, Deepak says if he faces a similar situation in the future, he will still stand up against what is wrong.
""If we remain silent today, tomorrow our children will also learn the same silence,"" he says.

Japan says it seized Chinese vessel amid tensions with Beijing,2026-02-13T02:44:29.274Z," Toby Mann
","Japanese authorities say they have seized a Chinese fishing vessel that tried to flee when ordered to stop for an inspection, in a move that may further fuel tensions with Beijing.
The boat was in Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture in the south-west when it was intercepted and its captain arrested on Thursday, according to the country's fisheries agency.
""The vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection by a fisheries inspector, but the vessel failed to comply and fled,"" the fisheries agency said.
The seizure is the first time since 2022 that the agency has seized a Chinese fishing boat. China has yet to react to Japan's statement.
There were 11 people aboard, including the captain who is a 47-year-old Chinese national, the fisheries agency said.
Authorities and Japanese media have described the seized vessel as a ""tiger net fishing boat"" with a high capacity.
""We will continue to take resolute action in our enforcement activities to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels,"" Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said on Friday.
Thursday's incident comes amid strained relations after Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi enraged China in November by suggesting Tokyo would intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.
China has long insisted that Taiwan, occupied for decades by Japan until 1945, is its territory.
It has not ruled out using force to achieve what it calls ""reunification"".
In response to Takaichi's remarks, which China's foreign ministry described as ""egregious"", Beijing summoned Tokyo's ambassador and warned its citizens to reconsider travel and study in Japan.
That led to a sharp drop in visits to Japan by Chinese tourists, and a subsequent hit to Japanese stocks related to tourism and retail.
As the diplomatic spat deepened during the end of 2025, Beijing repeatedly demanded that Takaichi retract her comments, and its foreign ministry warned Japan to ""stop playing with fire"".
Japanese artists touring China have also had shows cancelled and releases of popular Japanese movies have been postponed.
Japan's last two pandas were even returned to China last month.

What do we know about Kim Jong Un's daughter - and expected successor?,2026-02-12T16:00:09.852Z," Flora Drury
BBC News
","Kim Jong Un's arrival in China for his first ever multilateral meeting was always going to make headlines.
But it was the smartly-dressed girl standing just behind him as he exited his armoured train last September which caught Korea watchers' attention: Kim Ju Ae, the North Korean leader's daughter.
Kim Jong Un has selected Miss Kim as his heir, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday.
But details - including her exact age - are thin on the ground. So what exactly do we know?
Miss Kim has, for a number of years, been believed to be the second of Kim Jong Un's and his wife, Ri Sol-Ju's, three children.
The exact number, and their order, is by no means certain, however Kim is very secretive about his family, only introducing his wife to the public after they had been married for some time.
Kim Ju Ae is their only child whose existence has been confirmed by the country's leadership. No other child has been seen in public.
News of her existence first emerged through an unlikely source: the basketball player Dennis Rodman, who revealed to The Guardian newspaper back in 2013 that he ""held their baby Ju Ae"" during a trip to the secretive state.
Little was then heard about her until November 2022, when she appeared alongside her father at the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
By February the next year, she was appearing on postage stamps and attending banquets for top officials - described as Kim Jong Un's ""respected"" daughter.
The adjective ""respected"" is reserved for North Korea's most revered. In her father's case, he was referred to as ""respected comrade"" only after his status as future leader was cemented.
South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) provided lawmakers with a few extra details on the little girl at around the same time, according to news agency AP.
They said she enjoyed horse riding, skiing and swimming, and was home-schooled in the capital Pyongyang. They suggested she was around 10 years old.
By January 2024, the NIS had come to another conclusion: that the little girl was the ""most likely"" successor to Kim Jong Un - although they noted there were ""many variables"" still in play, not least because of her father's young age.
Since then, she has appeared by her father's side on numerous occasions. Standing next to him at ICBM launches and military parades, she has taken centre stage and received military salutes from senior military commanders.
But September 2025 marked the first time she was seen outside North Korea.
The Kim family, who have ruled North Korea since 1948, tell citizens they hail from a sacred bloodline, meaning only they can lead the country.
However, there is speculation that Kim has introduced his daughter at this point to try to overcome prejudice in the deeply patriarchal state, which has never been led by a woman.

Polls close in first election since Gen Z protests ousted Bangladesh leader,2026-02-12T13:15:35.113Z," Simon Fraser

Dhaka
","Votes are being counted in Bangladesh after its first election since student-led protests ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024.
More than 2,000 candidates are vying for 300 elected seats in parliament, though none from the banned Awami League of Hasina, who fled after 15 years in power after a brutal security crackdown in which hundreds of protesters were killed.
The election pits the centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) against a coalition led by the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, which joined forces with a party born out of the student uprising.
Results are expected on Friday and there's widespread hope among voters of a return to democracy.
For the first time since 2008, the outcome of an election in Bangladesh cannot be predicted with certainty. The past few elections were widely condemned as systematically rigged in favour of Sheikh Hasina.
She has been convicted and sentenced to death in absentia for ordering the brutal crackdown against protesters 18 months ago, in which the UN says as many as 1,400 protesters were killed.
Hasina is in exile in India from where she's rejected the charges against her and has questioned the legitimacy of the election.

The ban on her Awami League contesting the polls casts a shadow over whether this election can be described as free and fair. But, for the first time in years, voters on the ground were telling the BBC they feel like they have a choice.
More than 120 million people were eligible to vote, about four in 10 of them under 37. They were also casting their ballots in a referendum on constitutional change, which was proposed by the interim government that replaced Hasina and is aimed at fixing what it has called a completely broken political system.
Speaking after voting, Bangladesh's interim leader - the Nobel Peace Price laureate Muhammad Yunus - said the country had ""ended the nightmare and begun a new dream"".
Turnout had reached 49% by 14:00 local time (08:00 GMT), the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting told the BBC.
Nearly a million police and soldiers have been deployed to maintain law and order.
Yunus voted in the capital Dhaka, as did the two leading candidates, Tarique Rahman, 60, for the BNP, and Jamaat's leader Shafiqur Rahman, 67.
Before casting his ballot, Rahman said he was feeling ""confident"" about how the election would play out. He told the BBC he'd been waiting ""more than a decade"" for this day.
He has criticised Jamaat for using religious sentiment to win votes, and is promising economic and democratic reforms, as well as a ""rainbow nation"", where a new ""National Reconciliation Commission"" would help the country move past its divisions.
The son of the late Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's first female prime minister, Rahman is a product of dynastic politics many reformers would like to change. Zia herself came to power after her husband, a former president, was assassinated in a military coup.
Both the BNP - the Awami League's long-time rival - and Jamaat-e-Islami have a long history in Bangladesh, and both were crushed along with other opponents of Hasina under her long rule.
Rahman, who lived in London during the Hasina years, may be tipped as front-runner for prime minister, but Jamaat is expected to mount a serious challenge.
On two previous occasions - in the 1990s and the early 2000s - Jamaat has been a junior partner in a coalition led by the BNP in constitutionally-secular Bangladesh.
But, with the Awami League absent, Jamaat is for the first time a major player on the ballot - though it's chances of winning are seen by most observers as slim.
Shafiqur Rahman, a former political prisoner, and his party have run a well organised grassroots campaign on a platform of justice and ending corruption. They are also not associated with dynastic politics.
Jamaat gained momentum of its own in the run-up to the vote, and many of its new supporters believe it has modernised.
But many female voters feel sidelined, despite the fact women played a leading role in the uprising.
Of the 30 candidates Jamaat is allowing the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) to field, only two are women. Jamaat is fielding more than 200 candidates, all of them men. The BNP fielded 10 women out of more than 250 candidates.

"Jailed Imran Khan loses most of his vision in right eye, says lawyer",2026-02-12T12:14:39.082Z," Caroline Davies
Pakistan correspondentandOlivia Ireland
","Former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan has 15% vision left in his right eye after prison authorities failed to take action, his lawyers have told Pakistan's supreme court.
His lawyer Salman Safdar, who was permitted to visit his client in prison this week, said the former cricketer began experiencing blurred and hazy vision three to four months ago.
But, despite telling the jail superintendent, no action was taken beyond giving him eye drops, Safdar said.
Pakistan's authorities previously confirmed Khan had a 20-minute medical procedure on 24 January at Islamabad's PIMS hospital, when minister Ata Tarar said Khan was ""fine and healthy"".
Safdar, who was Khan's first outside visitor in seven weeks, said his client's condition was diagnosed as a blood clot in his right eye, causing severe damage which has left him with limited vision.
He submitted a report on Tuesday detailing Khan's condition to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hasan.
Khan had been left ""visibly perturbed and deeply distressed by the loss of vision and the absence of timely and specialised medical intervention"", Safdar said, who asked for his client be examined by a team of expert ophthalmologists, get access to his family and have better prison conditions.
The court ruled Khan be granted access to his personal physicians in Adiala Jail, where he is currently incarcerated, and be allowed to telephone his sons Kasim and Sulaiman.
In Safdar's report, it said Khan's prison conditions included a room with basic furniture, 100 books, two dumbbells, a prayer mat and a TV that does not work.
In summer, the report said the room gets hot and humid with insects and mosquitos frequently coming inside and Khan had food poisoning two to three times during the hot months.
Khan receives a mushaqati - a helper who is also a prisoner - who washes and cleans the cell. Khan can also walk around a 12x30 foot lawn during daytime hours.
One of Pakistan's interior ministers previously described Khan as ""the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan"" with access to gym equipment and a cook.
Khan, who previously captained the Pakistan national cricket team, served as Pakistan's prime minister from 2018 to 2022. His government launched major infrastructure and social programs including free healthcare and promoting renewable energy.
He was imprisoned in August 2023 and has faced charges in over 100 cases, ranging from leaking state secrets to selling state gifts - all of which he decried as politically motivated.
His jailing triggered large-scale protests by supporters - which were met with a crackdown by authorities. Thousands of protesters have been arrested and many injured in clashes with the police.

"Kim Jong Un chooses teen daughter as heir, says Seoul",2026-02-12T11:10:55.050Z," Jake Kwon
Seoul correspondent
","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has selected his daughter as his heir, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday.
Kim Ju Ae - who is believed to be 13 - has in recent months been pictured beside her father in high-profile events like a visit to Beijing in September, her first known trip abroad.
The National Intelligence Service (NIS) said it took a ""range of circumstances"" into account including her increasingly prominent public presence at official events"" in making this assessment.
The NIS also said it would keep close tabs on whether she will attend the North's party congress later this month - its largest political event that is held once every five years.
The party Congress is where Pyongyang is expected to give more details about priorities like foreign policy, war planning and nuclear ambitions for the next five years.
On Thursday lawmaker Lee Seong-kwen told reporters that Ju Ae, who was previously described by the NIS as being ""trained"" to be a successor, was now at the stage of ""successor designation"".
""As Kim Ju Ae has shown her presence at various events, including the founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army and her visit to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, and signs have been detected of her voicing her opinion on certain state policies, the NIS believes she has now entered the stage of being designated as successor,"" Lee said.
Ju Ae is the only known child of Kim Jong Un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju. The NIS believes Kim Jong Un has an older son, but this son has never been acknowledged nor shown on North Korean media.
News of Ju Ae's existence first emerged through an unlikely source: the American basketball player Dennis Rodman, who revealed to The Guardian newspaper back in 2013 that he ""held baby Ju Ae"" during a trip to the secretive state.
Ju Ae made her first appearance on state television in 2022. She was shown inspecting North Korea's latest intercontinental ballistic missile while holding her father's hand.

She has since made frequent appearances on state media, softening her father's image of a ruthless dictator. She accompanied him to Beijing for China's largest-ever military parade, where she was seen stepping off his armoured train at Beijing Railway Station.
She is often seen wearing her hair long, which is forbidden for her peers, and wearing designer clothes, which are out of reach for most in her country.
Another lawmaker, Park Sun-won said the role Ju Ae had taken on during public events indicated that she has started to provide policy input and is being treated as the de facto second-highest leader.
The North Korean power had passed down the three generations of the Kim family, and it is widely believed that Kim Jong Un will pass on the throne to Ju Ae.
In recent months, she was shown standing taller than her father, walking beside him, rather than following him.
In North Korea, where photos published by the state media are believed to carry a great symbolic weight, it is rare for individuals other than Kim Jong Un to be positioned equally prominently in the frame.
Although the South Korean spy agency now believes Ju Ae is the designated heir, it still raises questions.
It is puzzling why Ju Ae, a daughter, would be selected as the heir above an older son in North Korea's deeply patriarchal society.
Many defectors and analysts had previously dismissed the idea of a woman leading North Korea as an unlikely scenario, referring to the country's entrenched traditional gender roles. But Kim Jong Un's sister - Kim Yo Jong - does offer a precedent for female authority in the regime.
Kim Yo Jong currently holds a senior position in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and is reported to have influence over her brother.
However, it is also a mystery why Kim Jong Un, who is still young and appears relatively healthy, is already designating a 13-year-old child as his heir now.
It is unclear what changes Ju Ae's succession may bring to North Korea.
Many North Koreans hoped that Kim Jong Un, a Western-educated young man, would open their country up to the outside when he succeeded his father.
Yet such hope was unfulfilled. Whatever plans this teenager may have for her country, she would likely have the singular power to shape it however she likes.

China's Xi Jinping makes rare reference to recent military purge,2026-02-12T04:24:26.341Z," Yvette TanandStephen McDonell
China correspondent
","Chinese President Xi Jinping has made a rare public reference to a recent crackdown which saw the country's top military general removed.
General Zhang Youxia, who was widely seen as Xi's closest military ally, was removed from his post in January. He was accused of ""serious violations of discipline and law"" - typically a euphemism for corruption.
Speaking in a virtual address on Tuesday, Xi said the past year had been ""unusual and extraordinary"", adding that the army had ""undergone revolutionary tempering in the fight against corruption"".
Since coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives, which critics say have also been used as a tool to purge political rivals.
In his remarks on Tuesday, Xi also added that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had effectively addressed ""various risks and challenges"", adding that many in the army had gone through ""in-depth political rectification"".
He also said that PLA troops had been ""loyal to the Party... and proven themselves capable and dependable"".
The latest remarks come as part of Xi's annual Chinese New Year greetings to the PLA. This is the first time since 2022 that he has made any reference to corruption in his annual greeting.
Zhang, 75, was vice-chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) - a top military leadership group headed by Xi, when he was purged.
Another senior officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also removed from his post along with Zhang.
The most recent purge comes on the back of another crackdown which saw nine top generals - including some CMC members - removed from their posts in October 2025. Authorities at the time said the purges were part of an anti-corruption drive as well.
Records show that 14 full-rank generals have been sacked or investigated in the past three years.
The latest purges have decimated the seven-member CMC to just two - of which one is Xi himself.
The latest comments by Xi are highly unusual.
He never does press conferences or gives interviews - even to the tightly-controlled Chinese media.
But even he must occasionally reassure the population, and especially the Party cadres, that what he is doing makes some sort of sense.
Speaking about the crackdown is likely designed to convince them that there is a plan in place, especially given that the latest round of purges would have impacted the military's ability to fight and win a war in the immediate future.
Xi has made the fight against corruption a central pillar of his rule, calling it the ""biggest threat"" to the Communist Party and saying that the battle ""remains grave and complex"".
""The actual language surrounding the purges do not provide much detail about what exactly is going on internally, whether it really is corruption, political struggles, outright purges, or something else,"" said Professor Chong Ja Ian of the National University of Singapore.
""Publicity surrounding the purges are meant to be a signal, more likely domestic and internal to the CCP than anything else. The suggest the heavy consequences of either being corrupt or not following Xi's preferences closely enough, whatever they may be at a given moment.""

Principal shot in Thailand school siege dies of injuries,2026-02-12T02:41:10.520Z," Joel Guinto
","A school principal shot by a gunman who laid siege to the institute in southern Thailand has died in hospital, authorities said.
Sasiphat Sinsamosorn and a female student were shot by the 18-year-old man, who entered the school near the city of Hat Yai shortly before 17:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Wednesday.
Sasiphat died of her injuries before dawn on Thursday, local police said. The student who was shot is in stable condition. Another student who jumped out of a window during the siege is also still in hospital, police said.
The gunman was arrested after a two-hour standoff that saw a number of students and teachers trapped in the Phatong Prathan Keeriwat School building.
The motive for the attack remains unclear, although local media reports suggest the suspect may have had a grievance with a teacher at the school.
In a Facebook post, the school expressed its ""deepest condolences"" over the principal's death.
""Although we have lost her, the memories and kindness she left behind will forever remain in our hearts,"" the post said.
Levels of gun crime are relatively high in Thailand, where gun ownership, both legal and illegal, is widespread.
The country has seen several deadly incidents in recent years.
Last year, five people were killed in a shooting at a food market in Bangkok.
In 2023, a 14-year-old boy killed two people and injured five others in a shooting at a luxury shopping mall in the centre of Bangkok.
A year earlier a former police officer killed 36 people, most of them children, at a kindergarten in north-eastern Thailand, in one of the country's deadliest mass shootings.

India orders social media firms to remove unlawful content within three hours,2026-02-11T08:27:41.233Z," Abhishek Dey
Guwahati
","India has introduced new rules that make it mandatory for social media companies to remove unlawful material within three hours of being notified, in a sharp tightening of the existing 36-hour deadline.
The amended guidelines will take effect from 20 February and apply to major platforms including Meta, YouTube and X. They will also apply to AI-generated content.
The government did not provide a reason for reducing the takedown window.
But critics worry the move is part of a broader tightening of oversight of online content and could lead to censorship in the world's largest democracy with more than a billion internet users
In recent years, Indian authorities have used existing Information Technology rules to order social media platforms to remove content deemed illegal under laws dealing with national security and public order. Experts say they give authorities wide-ranging power over social media content.
According to transparency reports, more than 28,000 URLs or web links were blocked in 2024 following government requests.
The BBC has contacted the ministry of electronics and information technology for comment on the latest changes. Meta declined to respond to the amendments. The BBC has also approached X and Google, which owns YouTube, for a response.
The amendments also introduce new rules for AI-generated content.
For the first time, the law defines AI-generated material, including audio and video that has been created or altered to look real, such as deepfakes. Ordinary editing, accessibility features and genuine educational or design work are excluded.
The rules mandate that platforms that allow users to create or share such material must clearly label it. Where possible, they must also add permanent markers to help trace where it came from.
Companies will not be allowed to remove these labels once they are added. They must also use automated tools to detect and prevent illegal AI content, including deceptive or non-consensual material, false documents, child sexual abuse material, explosives-related content and impersonation.
Digital rights groups and technology experts have raised concerns about the feasibility and implications of the new rules.
The Internet Freedom Foundation said the compressed timeline would transform platforms into ""rapid fire censors"".
""These impossibly short timelines eliminate any meaningful human review, forcing platforms toward automated over-removal,"" the group said in a statement.
Anushka Jain, a research associate at the Digital Futures Lab, welcomed the labelling requirement, saying it could improve transparency. However, she warned that the three-hour deadline could push companies towards full automation.
""Companies are already struggling with the 36-hour deadline because the process involves human oversight. If it gets completely automated, there is a high risk that it will lead to censoring of content,"" she told the BBC.
Delhi-based technology analyst Prasanto K Roy described the new regime as ""perhaps the most extreme takedown regime in any democracy"".
He said compliance would be ""nearly impossible"" without extensive automation and minimal human oversight, adding that the tight timeframe left little room for platforms to assess whether a request was legally appropriate.
On AI labelling, Roy said the intention was positive but cautioned that reliable and tamper-proof labelling technologies were still developing.
The BBC has reached out to the Indian government for a response to these concerns.

'We are treated as outcasts': Acid attack survivor fights for justice and dignity,2026-02-11T00:56:11.643Z," Cherylann Mollan
Mumbai
","Warning: This story contains distressing details
Shaheen Malik, an acid-attack survivor and disability rights activist in India, is fighting an uphill legal and social battle to secure justice and rehabilitation for others like her - and says she will not give up despite the odds.
One survivor she's been helping is Ruman* who alleges that her husband beat her and forced her to drink acid during an episode of domestic violence in 2019.
The alleged incident left her with severe internal injuries and a damaged oesophagus that had to be artificially reconstructed so that she could eat.
Despite years of treatment, Ruman struggles to swallow food and eats little. At 28, she weighs just 21kg, less than the average weight of an eight-year-old girl. Basic tasks like going to the bathroom exhaust her and she needs constant medical supervision.
But despite her grave situation, Ruman is unable to seek compensation and rehabilitative benefits that acid attack survivors are allowed under India's disability law.
The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 only recognises those as victims who have suffered visible disfiguration due to the ""throwing of acid or similar substances"", excluding those who have been forced to ingest acid.
In December, Shaheen petitioned the Supreme Court saying the disability law must also include survivors like Ruman.
""For survivors of forced acid ingestion, the disfigurement is internal and hence not as obvious. But their lives are extremely challenging as they find it difficult to breathe, speak and swallow food despite numerous surgeries,"" she says.
Malik, 42, has been campaigning for the rights of acid attack survivors for over a decade. Her determination to help others seems to come from the challenges she has had to battle as a survivor.
She has undergone 25 surgeries and lost vision in her left eye after she was attacked with acid outside her workplace in northern Haryana state in 2009. Malik was in her 20s at the time and was working as a student counsellor.
For 16 years, she fought a legal battle to bring her perpetrators to justice before a trial court acquitted them in December. Malik says she's devastated, but not defeated, and has challenged the verdict.
""I fought for justice for myself. But now, I'm fighting for the sake of other survivors and victims of abuse. I want my case to be an example of justice served, that perpetrators won't walk free and will be made to face the consequences of their actions,"" she says.
In 2021, Malik set up the Brave Souls Foundation - a non-profit that offers legal and economic aid to acid attack survivors. The foundation acts as a lifeline for those who have been shunned by society and their families and have nowhere to go for help.
Around 50 survivors live in the foundation's shelter home in Delhi's Jangpura neighbourhood, where they are offered care and assistance. Ruman is among them as she does not want to be a burden on her parents, who are old and struggling to make ends meet, Malik says.
The foundation is also helping Ruman fight her case after her husband appealed against his conviction in a higher court and was released on bail last year.
Malik says she and Ruman are among hundreds of survivors who are fighting an uphill battle for justice. The conviction rate in acid attack cases is abysmally low with cases languishing in courts for years.
A 2024 report which analysed data from 2017-2021 found that from the 600 cases pending trial in 2021, only 15 were disposed off by courts.
This trend is confirmed by by the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, which shows that of the 703 cases pending trial in 2023, only 43 were disposed off, with convictions in 16.
Meanwhile, the number of acid attack cases in the country have been rising - NCRB recorded 176 in 2021, 202 in 2022 and 207 in 2023.
Last month, while hearing Malik's petition, the Supreme Court directed all states to furnish a yearly report of acid attacks, cases disposed off and those pending in courts, as well as rehabilitation schemes offered to victims. It also sought details of victims forcefully made to ingest acid.
Strongly condemning acid attacks, the judges called for ""extraordinary punitive measures"", including auctioning the assets of attackers to compensate their victims.
The court also asked the federal government to consider ""legislative interventions"", like shifting the burden of proof on to the accused from the victim.
While Malik welcomes the top court's observations and directions, she says that along with sprucing up laws, there's an urgent need to ensure their proper implementation.
She points out that acid attack survivors still struggle to get affordable medical care even though private and public hospitals are legally mandated to provide free treatment to them, including reconstructive surgeries.
""Many private hospitals refuse to admit acid attack survivors until they are furnished with a court order, delaying life-saving treatment to victims,"" she says.
""And even after they are admitted, hospitals make the patient wait for long hours to receive treatment and often, discontinue it mid-way by making excuses,"" she adds.
She also questions why it remains so easy to buy acid despite the increase in cases and existing regulations around over-the-counter sale of the substance.
""A single incident alters our whole life. We are treated like outcasts by society and face so many difficulties. Shouldn't the government do more to prevent more people from suffering the same fate as us?"" Malik says.
Malik is intimately acquainted with the stigma and social isolation she talks about.
A few months back, Malik says, she was told to move her foundations's office without being given any reason. She says she has been searching for a new place for weeks, but hasn't been able to find one.
""Many people feel that we [acid attack survivors] may bring them back luck. Some feel uncomfortable seeing our faces. So, many people don't want to rent to us,"" she says.
But Malik says she won't give up and will continue fighting for a space for people like herself in society.

The taekwondo teacher tasked with healing India's troubled state,2026-02-10T07:39:30.488Z," Abhishek Dey
Guwahati
","Manipur, in India's northeast, has a new chief minister after being under direct federal rule, which was imposed a year ago, following ethnic violence that left more than 260 people dead.
Yumnam Khemchand Singh, a fifth-dan black belt in Korean martial art taekwondo, took oath last week, inheriting a state still scarred by clashes between the majority Meitei and the minority Kuki-Zo communities.
Since the 2023 violence, the communities have been largely segregated, confined to separate regions, with thousands displaced from their homes.
Singh has a long association with taekwondo and has taught the martial art for years. But he is also a seasoned politician. Despite long ties to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP's) ideological parent, the 62-year-old was a late entrant to electoral politics.
Singh, who belongs to the BJP, was first elected in 2017 and has since served as assembly speaker and a state minister overseeing portfolios including education and rural development.
Now, as he takes charge of a troubled state, the question is whether he can help bring peace?
Opinion remains divided. While some Manipur residents and analysts told the BBC they see hope in his leadership, others remain sceptical.
""It is difficult to say anything right now, and the next few weeks will be crucial in giving a clearer picture,"" Pradip Phanjoubam of the Imphal Review of Arts and Politics magazine, told the BBC.
Even as Singh takes office, tensions in Manipur continue to simmer.
On 21 January, a man from the Meitei community was killed in a Kuki-Zo-dominated area where he had been living with his wife, who is from the Kuki-Zo community. This was the latest in a series of killings linked to the conflict.
Hours after Singh took oath on 4 February, protests broke out in the state's Churachandpur district, with roads blocked and markets and offices shut.
Kuki-Zo civil society groups and student organisations condemned the participation of some Kuki-Zo legislators in the formation of the new government, calling it a ""betrayal"" and reiterating their demand for a separate administrative arrangement for Kuki-Zo-dominated areas.
While the valley areas in Manipur, including its capital, Imphal, are largely inhabited by the Meiteis, Kuki-Zos predominantly live in the surrounding hills.
Even as tensions between Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities persist, new frictions have emerged between Kuki-Zo and Naga tribal groups, adding another layer of complexity to Manipur's unrest. Tensions were reported on Sunday in the state's Ukhrul district, where authorities have imposed restrictions on gatherings following an alleged assault involving villagers from the two communities.
Singh belongs to the Meitei community. And three ministers in his cabinet, including one deputy chief minister, are from the Kuki-Zo community - a composition that reflects an effort by the BJP to balance ethnic representation in a deeply divided state.
But some in the Kuki-Zo community are not convinced.
""Peace is not just the absence of violence. It requires trust, justice and political sincerity,"" Mang Khongsai, a Kuki student leader, told the BBC.
Khongsai says he does not believe that Singh can bring peace under the current circumstances.
""He [Singh] is part of a political establishment that has failed to produce a credible roadmap to resolve the conflict, assure security or address the core demand for separate administrations.""
Glady Vaiphei Hunjan, an adviser to the Kuki-Zo Women's Forum in Delhi, says peace could not be ""imposed by maintaining the status quo"".
""Leadership that can bring peace must demonstrate moral clarity - by acknowledging where the state has failed, engaging all stakeholders equally and committing to a political solution rather than administrative management of a conflict,"" she says.
Manipur, with a population of about three million, covers roughly 22,327 sq km (8,620 sq m), is one of India's smallest states that is slightly larger than Wales.
The state has a long history of armed resistance and the violence of the past two years has seen militias and village volunteers take up arms amid deep communal mistrust. It has long been subject to a controversial law that gives the military sweeping power in regions designated as ""disturbed areas"".
Despite decades of unrest, Manipur has built a reputation as one of India's most consistent producers of elite athletes - such as Olympic weightlifter Mirabai Chanu, boxer Mary Kom and judo champion Sushila Devi Likmabam. This is often attributed to a strong local sporting culture, early exposure to football, boxing and martial arts and community-run clubs that have long offered structure and opportunity - a tradition Singh himself was part of.
Sunzu Bachapatiyum, a filmmaker who belongs to the Meitei community, says he is optimistic about Singh's leadership.
""He [Singh] is one politician who has working relationships with leaders across communities - that is a significant advantage,"" he says. ""The fact that he could gather sufficient legislative support to form a government suggests a degree of acceptability. In the current climate, that is at least a step forward.""
Singh can play a ""significant role"" in bringing peace in Manipur, says journalist Kshetrimayum Premchand, who belongs to the Meitei community. ""He is a good administrator. Whether as a legislator or a state minister, he has been transparent about his functioning.""
Some observers also point to Singh's December 2025 visit to a relief camp for internally displaced Kuki-Zo people as a significant factor in his emergence as the chief ministerial choice. The outreach, widely seen as unusual for a senior Meitei leader during the conflict, could have helped broaden his acceptability among Kuki-Zo legislators, say analysts.
But Seram Rojesh, convener of the Delhi Meitei Coordinating Committee, says lasting peace would require the ""disarming of armed ethnic groups"" that have played a role in the violence.
Arambam Noni, an associate professor in Imphal's Dhanamanjuri University says Singh should prioritise ""dialogue"" and ""ensure non-violation of the rule of law"". He also cautions against giving into the demand of Kuki-Zos for a separate administration because ""it can have ripple effects for others, who can escalate similar demands, given Manipur's overlapping cultural and ethnic diversities"".
The return of an elected government creates space for political engagement, but deep mistrust between communities has resurfaced even in periods of relative calm, say analysts.
""Peace will depend on whether that authority is used to rebuild trust across communities rather than simply restoring administrative normalcy,"" says Phanjoubam, the Imphal-based editor.

Philippine top court says same-sex couples can co-own property,2026-02-10T06:31:12.492Z," Joel GuintoandVirma Simonette
","The Philippine Supreme Court in a landmark decision has ruled that same-sex couples can be considered co-owners of property.
Applying a provision of the country's Family Code for the first time, the court said same-sex couples can be recognised as co-owners if it is proven that both parties contributed to acquiring a property.
Same-sex unions are outlawed in conservative Catholic Philippines and it is the only country in the world, outside of the Vatican, that does not allow divorce.
This has left LGBT couples without legal protections when it comes to property, finance and healthcare.
The Supreme Court ruling, which was made public on Tuesday, involved a former couple - two women - who had feuded over plans to sell their house and lot in suburban Manila.
One of the women refused to sell their house after initially agreeing to do so, leading the other to file a claim before a lower court asking to divide their property. The lower court denied the claim, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
But the Supreme Court on 5 February reversed the lower court rulings. It cited a document made by one partner - and acknowledged by the other - that she paid 50% of the purchase and renovation costs.
The property was registered under the name of only one of the partners to make the paperwork during the acquisition faster, since they were not married or related by blood.
While the Family Code defines marriage as a bond between a man and a woman, the court said Article 148 - which governs ""property relations of people who live together but cannot legally marry"" - does not discriminate based on gender and ""applies to all forms of co-habitation"".
Article 148 applies to same-sex couples, ""otherwise, we render legally invisible some forms of legitimate intimate relationships"", said Associate Justice Marvic Leonen.
Associate Justice Amy Lazaro Javier further noted that Article 148 must not be limited to heterosexual couples ""given the prevailing values in modern society as well as the glaring yet unjustified difference in the treatment of heterosexual couples vis-à-vis their homosexual counterparts"".
A spokesperson for the Supreme Court, Camille Ting, confirmed to the BBC that it is the first time Article 148 of the Family Code has been used to decide on a case regarding property rights of a same-sex couple.
The court in its decision also called on government and lawmakers to address the needs of same-sex couples.
""With the political, moral, and cultural questions that surround the issue concerning the rights of same-sex couples, political departments especially the Congress must be involved to quest for solutions,"" the court said.

Thailand election: The result the polls never saw coming,2026-02-09T23:58:04.894Z," Jonathan Head
South East Asia correspondent
","As the dust from what has been a hard-fought election campaign in Thailand settles, many Thais may be rubbing their eyes and asking, ""what just happened?"".
Most of the opinion polls published before the election predicted a win for the progressive People's Party. Some suggested it would get more than 200 seats in parliament, a significant improvement on its already impressive 2023 result when it won 151. Few polls put the party of Prime Minister Anutin Chanrvirakul ahead.
Yet once most of the votes had been counted, it was clear Anutin had achieved a stunning victory, and the young reformists had suffered a big setback. With a projected share of more than 190 seats, the path of Anutin's Bhumjaithai party is clear to form the next government, albeit with coalition partners.
So why did a youthful, progressive party with an imaginative and tech-savvy campaign do so poorly compared to a transactional, old-style party with little ideological identity aside from strong loyalty to the monarchy?
The mixed voting system played a part. People in Thailand cast two ballots, one for a candidate in their constituency, and one for the party they prefer.
At the national level the People's Party, with nearly 10 million votes, did much better in the party list than Bhumjaithai, with just under six million votes, although this was still a big drop compared to the more than 14 million Move Forward, the previous incarnation of the People's Party, won in 2023.
But the party list accounts for only 20% of the 500 seats in parliament.
As many as 80% of the seats are allocated by local contests, where whichever candidate get the most votes in each constituency wins the seat on a first-past-the-post basis.
This is where the People's Party, which is relatively new and urban-based, is weaker because it lacks rural networks.
Bhumjaithai, by comparison, is a past master at using its substantial resources to win local power-brokers to its side, and they exercise a lot of influence over voters in their areas.
Anutin has used the defections of political veterans from other parties to grow Bhumjaithai from a medium-sized provincial movement which won only 51 seats in 2019, to a national-level election-winning powerhouse today.
It was also harder for the reformists to distinguish themselves on a single issue this time. In 2023, after nine years being ruled by the stern, avuncular Prayuth Chan-ocha, the general who led the 2014 coup, there was a broad yearning for change, and the Move Forward party, under its suave, telegenic leader Pita Limjaroenrat, promised no deals with ""the uncles"" – those involved in the coup.
This captured the imagination of the public, and there was a last-minute wave of support for them.
In this election, there was no such defining issue, and the party had been forced to drop its campaign to amend the harsh lese majeste law after this was used by the courts to justify dissolving Move Forward and banning its leaders from politics.
Anutin was also able to coalesce conservative support around his party, as opposed to having their voters split among several parties in 2023.
His strident nationalism over the border conflict with Cambodia, his staunch support for the army and his intense loyalty to King Vajiralongkorn all defined him clearly as the standard-bearer for Thai conservatism.
Another big factor was the steep decline in the fortunes of Pheu Thai, the once unbeatable election machine backed by former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra.
It came second in 2023, with 141 seats, but is likely to see that total halved this time round after the past three years of political turmoil in which two of its prime ministers were dismissed by the constitutional court, and it was accused of mishandling relations with Cambodia.
Thaksin has been jailed on old corruption charges, and could face further criminal complaints.
Back in 2023, Pheu Thai lost support to Move Forward. This time, Bhumjaithai and other conservative parties were the beneficiaries of Pheu Thai's falling popularity in its old strongholds of the north and north-east.
Some in the reformist camp will look back on their party's controversial decision to back Anutin to become prime minister last September, after the fall of the second Pheu Thai administration.
At the time, the People's Party justified this strange alliance with its ideological opposite by promising not to join his government, and by extracting from him a pledge to hold a referendum on changing the military-drafted constitution, a priority for the reformists.
But by not insisting on cabinet positions in return for their votes in parliament, the People's Party allowed Anutin to fill his cabinet with capable technocrats, burnishing his credentials as a can-do leader.
And while the constitutional referendum was indeed held at the same time as the election on Sunday, and produced a clear vote in favour of changing it, the process of drafting and approving a new charter is so protracted it might be indefinitely delayed.
Some now see this as a poor decision, which tarnished their reputation among more idealistic followers.
In the end, though, the reformists always had a mountain to climb to get into government.
Many of their leaders have already been banned from politics, their party has been dissolved twice, and one of their best members of parliament is likely to go to jail for six years on lese majeste charges.
Even after their election loss, another 44 of their leading members now face bans from politics by the Supreme Court for supporting the proposal by Move Forward to soften the punishments under the lese majeste law.
These impediments may well have disillusioned some of the voters who backed Move Forward three years ago. Turnout in this election at 65% was sharply down from the 75% seen in 2023.
Anutin will face no such impediments.
The many means by which elected governments, parties and politicians can be constrained by unelected bodies – the ""handcuffs"" on Thai democracy – have only ever been used on those challenging the status quo.
Provided he can make terms with smaller coalition partners, the prime minister has a good chance of completing a full four-year term, something no civilian leader has managed to do in Thailand for 20 years.

"Twenty years is 'a death sentence', son of British media tycoon jailed by China says",2026-02-09T17:28:33.795Z," Johanna Chisholm
BBC News
","The son of Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai has called his imprisonment by Chinese authorities essentially a ""death sentence"".
The 78-year-old British citizen was sentenced on Monday for 20 years after he was found guilty of national security offences last December, marking the harshest sentence to be given under the city's controversial national security law (NSL).
Lai was one of the loudest critics of China, often using his pro-democracy paper, Apple Daily, as a tool of protest. He has always denied the charges against him.
Sebastien Lai, his son, told the BBC that he believed his father was being punished for ""defending the freedom of Hong Kong"".
As a British citizen, Sebastien told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, that Lai deserved much more.
""Surely a man who has given so much for liberty, for freedom deserves a bit of it himself,"" Sebastien said.
Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the UK government intends to ""rapidly engage further"" with Beijing on Lai's release.
""I again call on the Hong Kong authorities to end this appalling ordeal and release him on humanitarian grounds, so that he may be reunited with his family,"" Cooper said in a statement on Monday.
She added: ""We stand with the people of Hong Kong.""
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the sentence ""an unjust and tragic conclusion to this case"", and similarly urged authorities to grant Lai ""humanitarian parole"".
The sentence ""shows the world that Beijing will go to extraordinary lengths to silence those who advocate fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong"", he said in a statement.
Hailed as a hero by the pro-democracy movement, Lai was seen as a traitor by Beijing.
Western governments, including the UK and US, have for years called for his release, which Beijing and Hong Kong have rejected.
China introduced the controversial national security law in 2020 in response to pro-democracy protests which erupted in Hong Kong the year before.
The legislation makes illegal a wider range of dissenting acts, including anything the state regards as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.
It also allows Hong Kong to send cases to be tried in mainland China.
Lai was found guilty of foreign collusion and publishing seditious material under the NSL.
A court found that he used his now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper as part of a wider effort to lobby foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China.
For the last five years, he has been held in solitary confinement at a maximum security prison - a detention his son believes is causing his health to ""tremendously suffer"".
""Given his health, given that he has heart issues, given that he's lost 10kg over the last year alone, that's basically a death sentence,"" his son said.
On a trip to Beijing last month, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told reporters that he had raised the issue of Lai's release with Chinese authorities.
""Part of the rationale for engagement is to make sure that we can both seize the opportunities that are available - which is what we've done - but also have a mature discussion about issues that we disagree on,"" Sir Keir said after his meeting with President Xi Jinping.
Former UK prime minister David Cameron joined the government in calling for Lai's release, saying the activist's imprisonment was ""an affront to freedom of speech"".
""China must know that the world is watching,"" he wrote in a social media post.
Meanwhile, shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said Sir Keir's government ""should be ashamed of themselves for not securing the release of Jimmy"".
Following the prime minister's visit to China, the UK government announced that Beijing had agreed to allow UK citizens to travel visa-free for trips under 30 days.
The trip also saw an agreement to cut import taxes on UK whisky from 10% to 5%, as the government seeks closer trade ties with Beijing to help boost economic growth.
Asked about how he viewed the UK government's recent diplomatic efforts to normalise relations with China, Sebastien pointed out that his father's case could present an ""easy"" opportunity to build even stronger ties.
""If we talk about warming a relationship, well, I think for most people listening to this, isn't putting a 78-year-old man on a plane and sending him back here a very easy way for Hong Kong and China to do that?"", he told the BBC.
China maintains that its actions in the Lai case were ""reasonable, legitimate and legal"", with its foreign ministry saying on Monday there is ""no room for argument"".

","Jimmy Lai, Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon, has been jailed for 20 years for colluding with foreign forces under the city's controversial national security law.
Rights groups called it a death sentence for the 78-year-old, whose family has raised concerns about his health, but Hong Kong's leader said it was ""deeply gratifying"".
This is the harshest punishment to be handed down under the law, which China imposed after huge protests in 2019 demanding more freedom, and defends as essential for the city's stability.
Lai, a British citizen, is the most prominent of the hundreds arrested under the law. A fierce critic of China, he often wielded his paper, Apple Daily, as a tool of protest.
""It is incredibly heartbreaking,"" Lai's son, Sebastien, told the BBC's Today programme, adding that he had repeatedly raised Lai's imprisonment with the UK government but ""obviously my father is still in prison"".
Sebastien Lai and others have criticised Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit to China as a wasted opportunity.
The sentence ""signifies the total destruction of the Hong Kong legal system and the end of justice"", Sebastien said.
Hong Kong authorities and China's foreign ministry, however, insist the Lai's sentencing demonstrates the city's rule of law. In sentencing Lai, the judges condemned his ""serious and grave criminal conduct"" and said he was involved in conspiracies that were of the ""most serious"" category.
On Monday morning, ahead of sentencing, there was a heavy police presence around the court.
But there were also throngs of Lai's supporters, some of them having camped out for days hoping to get inside for his sentencing.
""I just wish to greet Mr Lai in person in court... That's all I ask for, because I think it will be the last time I see him,"" said one supporter, who said he'd stood in line since Thursday night.
Inside, Lai, who wore a white jacket and black glasses, smiled brightly at his family and other supporters. He nodded calmly when his sentence was announced, while some members of the public were heard sobbing. His wife Teresa held back tears as she left the court.
Lai, who was convicted of fraud and unauthorised assemblies in an earlier case, has already been in jail for more than five years.
Six former Apple Daily executives and two activists were also sentenced on Monday under the national security law, with terms ranging from six years and three months to 10 years.

Lai has always denied the charges against him, saying he was advocating for what he believed were Hong Kong's values, such as rule of law and free speech.
The case hinges on a meeting Lai had with the US' then Vice-President Mike Pence and then secretary of state Mike Pompeo at the height of the 2019 protests to discuss the situation in Hong Kong.
But when he testified in November, Lai said he had ""never"" used his foreign contacts to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong, adding that he was ""just relaying"" the situation to them.
Rights groups have denounced the sentence as ""draconian"" and ""egregious"".
""Today's egregious decision is the final nail in the coffin for freedom of the press in Hong Kong,"" said Jodie Ginsberg, from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
She called on the international community to ""step up its pressure"" to free Lai ""if we want press freedom to be respected anywhere in the world"".
Lai's case ""shows the Chinese government's determination to crush independent journalism and silence anyone who dares to criticise the Communist Party"", said Human Rights Watch's Asia director Elaine Pearson.
Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, who leads Lai's international legal team but was not allowed to defend him in court, also urged the international community to pressure China
""Now that this sham trial is finally over, we call on leaders from around the world to speak with one voice in their demand for China to free Jimmy Lai so he can come home to his family in London at last,"" she told the BBC.
A number of countries - including the UK, Australia, the European Union and Japan - have already expressed concern, while United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk called for his release, given his age and health concerns.
China's foreign ministry spokesperson shrugged off criticism, saying ""the relevant judicial cases are purely internal affairs"" of Hong Kong.
""The central government firmly supports the HKSAR government in maintaining national security and punishing criminal acts which endanger it,"" the spokesperson added.
In his last interview as a free man in 2020, Lai told the BBC ""I got everything I have because of [Hong Kong]"".
""If this is payback time, this is my redemption,"" said Lai, who was then out on bail.
Born in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, Lai was 12 when he arrived in Hong Kong as a stowaway on a fishing boat. He started working menial jobs and eventually founded a multi-million dollar empire that included the clothing brand Giordano.
Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist after China's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
He went on to launch pro-democracy news outlets like Apple Daily and Next magazine, while regularly participating in demonstrations.

Outrage as South Korean official suggests 'importing' foreign women to boost birth rate,2026-02-09T09:45:29.369Z," Koh Ewe
","A South Korean official who suggested the country ""import young women"" from ""Vietnam or Sri Lanka"" to boost its birth-rate has been expelled from his party.
Kim Hee-soo, the head of the southern Jindo County, said the woman could be married off to ""young men in rural areas"" during a town hall last week.
The suggestion comes as South Korea continues to grapple with the lowest birth-rates in the world, which could see the country's 50 million-strong population drop by half in 60 years.
But Kim's statement, which was televised, did not go down well - triggering a diplomatic protest from Vietnam, days of public anger and his expulsion from the ruling Democratic Party.
Attempts by Kim to defuse the outrage with an apology a day after the town hall appear to have failed.
The town hall had been called to discuss a potential merger between the province where Jindo County is located and a nearby city - something regions with shrinking populations are looking at for administrative reasons.
Kim said his comment had been intended to highlight population issues in rural regions but admitted the language he had used was ""inappropriate"", local media reported.
South Jeolla Province also issued a formal apology for Kim's ""inappropriate remarks"", which it said ""has caused deep pain to Vietnamese people and to women"", local media reported.
The Vietnamese Embassy in Seoul had condemned Kim's remarks, saying in a statement on Facebook that his words were ""not simply a matter of expression but a matter of values and attitudes towards migrant women and minority groups"".
Sri Lanka authorities have not publicly addressed the controversy.
The Democratic Party's Supreme Council had voted unanimously to expel Kim, a party spokesperson told reporters on Monday.
Meanwhile, activists for women and migrant rights are reportedly planning to hold a rally in front of Jindo County Office on Tuesday over Kim's comments.

Japanese stocks surge as Takaichi secures historic election victory,2026-02-09T07:56:32.477Z," Koh Ewe
news reporter
Shaimaa Khalil
Tokyo correspondentandOsmond Chia

","Japanese stocks surged to a record high on Monday, as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) basked in a historic election victory.
The LDP secured 316 out of 465 seats in Sunday's election, the first time a single party has won a two-thirds lower house majority since Japan's parliament was established in its current form in 1947.
The Japan Innovation Party, the LDP's coalition partner, won in 36 more constituencies, taking their combined total to 352 seats.
The resounding mandate is a gamble that paid off for Takaichi, who now faces the challenge of reviving Japan's moribund economy and tackling cost-of-living woes.
The Nikkei 225 index rallied by more than 5% in early trade on Monday, briefly crossing the 57,000 mark for the first time. It then gave up some gains, but still closed up 3.9% at a record high of 56,363.94.
The LDP's decisive win will help Takaichi advance her pro-business policies without having to negotiate extensively with opposition parties.
Takaichi told reporters on Sunday that she would pursue a ""responsible yet aggressive"" fiscal policy and would not reshuffle the Cabinet, which was formed less than four months ago.
Japan's first female prime minister called the snap election last month, just a few months after taking office in October. Her success is in marked contrast to her two predecessors, under whom the party lost its parliamentary majority, battled corruption scandals and struggled to curb rising costs.
Markets commentators say Takaichi's policies could boost the Japanese economy.
The election outcome and upcoming moves like ""stimulus, tax tweaks, and deregulation"" will be ""additional fuel for an existing bull trend"", investment analyst Yuka Marosek told the BBC.
Chris Scicluna, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe, said Japanese stock investors had ""long been believers in Takaichi"".
""They're confident that Japanese firms will benefit from her pledge to end austerity, they love her promises of more investment to boost growth, [and] they like the fact she's identified several strategic sectors such as defence and AI to benefit from extra policy support,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
However, he added that investors in Japanese government bonds and the yen were ""a lot more agnostic if not downright sceptical"" about Takaichi's intentions.
""Japanese government debt's extremely high and investors in bonds and the yen want to know how she intends to finance her plans,"" he said.
Historically low inflation in the country has made it very sensitive to the rising cost of living over recent years.
At this election, voters at polling stations told the BBC that they were worried about the increasing costs of groceries and rent.
The economy is also under pressure from the country's ageing population, which has seen a shrinking workforce and ballooning social care costs.
Takaichi has pledged to cut taxes and boost the Japanese economy through more spending - though where that money will come from is another big concern, given Japan's high government debt. Critics warn this could deepen instability in Japan's already fragile economy.
""We bear an extremely heavy responsibility to focus on steadily delivering on the campaign pledges we have made,"" Takaichi said on Sunday as her party's victory became clear, Kyodo reported.
The LDP had lost its parliamentary majority under Takaichi's predecessor Shigeru Ishiba. And Takaichi banked on her personal appeal to turn the LDP's lost fortunes around.
She has consolidated support among the LDP's conservative base by reviving long-dormant goals like revision to Japan's pacifist constitution and emphasising traditional values.
But she has also connected with younger voters in a way not seen before: her handbags and pink pens have become unlikely zeitgeist items.
US President Donald Trump congratulated Takaichi on her victory, writing on Truth Social that it was an ""Honor"" to endorse her ahead of the election.
""The wonderful people of Japan, who voted with such enthusiasm, will always have my strong support,"" Trump said.
Just one week after Takaichi took office in October last year, Tokyo rolled out the red carpet for Trump when he visited Japan. It was her diplomatic debut, and the optics were striking: fists pumping as the US president praised her in front of thousands of US soldiers.
Takaichi is due to travel to Washington in March for a second meeting with Trump.

Are Bangladesh's youth turning against India?,2026-02-09T07:00:48.786Z," Soutik Biswas
India correspondent
Dhaka
","The walls of Dhaka University are screaming again.
Graffiti - angry, witty, sometimes poetic - sprawls across walls and corridors, echoing the Gen Z-led July 2024 uprising that toppled Sheikh Hasina after 15 years in power. Once Bangladesh's pro-democracy icon, critics say she had grown increasingly autocratic. After her resignation, she fled to India.
Students gather in knots, debating politics. On an unkempt lawn, red lanterns sway above a modest Chinese New Year celebration - a small but telling detail in a country where Beijing and Delhi are both vying hard for influence. For many here, the election scheduled for 12 February will be their first genuine encounter with the ballot box.
Nobel peace-prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge days after Sheikh Hasina's fall. Hasina now lives in exile in Delhi, which has refused to return her to face a death sentence imposed in absentia over the brutal security crackdown in 2024 - violence in which the UN says around 1,400 people were killed, mostly by security forces.
Her Awami League - the country's oldest party, which commanded some 30% of the popular vote - has been barred from contesting. Analysts say the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is now moving to occupy the liberal-centrist space it has vacated. The main Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, has joined forces with a party born out of the student uprising.
But the slogans on the campus - and beyond - are not only about democracy at home. It increasingly points across the border.
""Dhaka, not Delhi"" is splashed on walls - and stitched onto saris, a traditional dress for women in South Asia. Among the young, ""hegemony"" has slipped into everyday speech, shorthand for India's long shadow over Bangladesh.
""The young generation feels India has been intervening in our country for many years,"" says Mosharraf Hossain, a 24-year-old sociology student. ""Especially after the 2014 election, which was basically a one-party election.""
That grievance - Delhi's perceived role in enabling Bangladesh's democratic erosion - sits at the heart of a sharp rise in anti-Indian sentiment. The result: India-Bangladesh relations, once touted as a model of neighbourhood diplomacy, are now at their lowest ebb in decades.
""Delhi is struggling in Dhaka because of deep anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh and a hardening, often a hostile turn, in India's own domestic political discourse towards its neighbour,"" says Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London.
Many blame Delhi for supporting an increasingly authoritarian Hasina in her final years and see India as an overbearing neighbour. They remember disputed general elections in 2014, 2018 and 2024 and Delhi's ""endorsement"" of them.
""India supported Hasina's regime without any pressure, without any questions,"" Hossain says. ""People think the destruction of democracy was supported by India.""
That sense of betrayal has merged with longer-standing grievances - border killings, water-sharing disputes, trade restrictions and inflammatory rhetoric from Indian politicians and television studios - into a more corrosive belief: that India views Bangladesh less as a sovereign equal than as a pliant backyard.
Local media is rife with reports that an Indian conglomerate supplying electricity to Bangladesh has been cheating the country - a charge the group denies. On Facebook, a key platform for political mobilisation, campaigns rage to ban a leading daily branded an ""Indian agent"". Both countries have suspended most visa services.
Delhi's decision to bar a Bangladeshi cricketer from the Indian Premier League (IPL) and refusal to move Bangladesh's T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka has fed resentment across the border.
""To be sure, India has channels with all stakeholders in Bangladesh. But translating such engagement into positive political outcomes remains challenging in the current political climate,"" says Paliwal.
Delhi has indeed begun to broaden its outreach.
Last month Foreign Minister S Jaishankar travelled to Dhaka for former prime minister and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Khaleda Zia's funeral, and used the occasion to meet the party's acting chairman Tarique Rahman. The 60-year-old heir to the Zia dynasty, Rahman recently returned after 17 years in exile in London and now looms as the frontrunner in the landmark election.
India has also opened channels to Islamist forces. A senior Jamaat-e-Islami leader told me that Indian officials have engaged the party's leadership four times in the past year, including a recent invitation to the Indian High Commission's Republic Day reception in a Dhaka hotel.
Yet these tactical shifts have done little to arrest the broader slide. Kamal Ahmed, consulting editor of The Daily Star newspaper, says the current chill marks a low unseen even during earlier crises. ""There's no doubt this is the lowest point of the bilateral relationship,"" he told the BBC.
The contrast with the Sheikh Hasina years is stark.
Over 17 years, Dhaka ""opened up almost all fronts for India"" - security co-operation, transit, trade, cultural exchange and people-to-people ties. Today, Ahmed says, ""nothing is moving - neither people nor goodwill"".
What appears to have turned scepticism into anger was Delhi's response after Hasina was ousted last August. Many Bangladeshis said they expected India to recalibrate a Bangladesh policy that had rested almost entirely on backing one party. Instead, India appeared to double down - offering Hasina refuge and tightening visa and trade restrictions. The message received in Dhaka, Ahmed says, was: Bangladeshis were ""not being valued as neighbours"".
Rhetoric has worsened matters.
When Indian politicians label Bangladeshi migrants ""termites"" or talk of teaching Bangladesh a lesson ""like Israel did in Gaza,"" Ahmed asks: ""How do you expect people in Bangladesh to react?""
Cultural retaliation followed - calls to boycott Indian goods, the suspension of IPL broadcasts - driven by resentment. ""Culture, trade, respect - nothing is one-way traffic,"" Ahmed says. ""Unfortunately, that's how the current Indian leadership is practising it.""
Yet officials in Dhaka caution against reading the relationship solely through its crises.
Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to Yunus, describes ties with India as ""multi-dimensional"", anchored in geography as much as politics. ""We share 54 rivers... We share language, we share the same history,"" he says, citing trade flows and daily movement across a 4,096km (2,545-mile) frontier.
Even so, Alam admits public sentiment has hardened sharply.
Ask Bangladeshis why they could not vote freely for over 15 years, he says, and many give the same answer: Sheikh Hasina's authoritarianism - and India's ""backing"" of it. ""They also say that Hasina has always been supported by India.""
Hasina's flight to India after the 2024 violence remains an especially sore point.
""Hundreds of young people were killed... and then she fled to India,"" Alam says. The perception that she was treated as a ""head of a government"", rather than a disgraced leader, deepened anger.
Alam also criticises Indian media coverage as alarmist, dismissing claims of systematic persecution of minority Hindus as ""a massive disinformation campaign"". Isolated incidents do occur, he says, but are routinely portrayed as religious violence. ""Come and visit,"" he urges Indian journalists. ""Meet the people and see what actually happened.""
India, meanwhile, says independent sources have documented more than 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities - including killings, arson and land grabs -during the interim government's tenure, adding that these cannot be all ""media exaggeration or dismissed as political violence"".
Ali Riaz, an academic who is currently serving as the special assistant to Yunus, believes the rupture runs deeper than miscommunication.
""It has reached the bottom,"" he says. He believes that over time, the relationship narrowed down to ""a relationship between a party or an individual and the Indian establishment, rather than between Bangladesh and India"".
Long-standing disputes amplified the damage. Water sharing, Riaz argues, creates hierarchy. ""If you control the water, the relationship immediately becomes unequal.""
Border killings cut deeper still. ""It is viewed as how the Indian establishment see the lives of Bangladeshis."" India has denied unlawful killings by its forces in specific deaths along the border.
These issues, analysts say, are not episodic irritants but symbols of imbalance.
That imbalance, critics argue, was reinforced after Hasina's fall. Mohammad Touhid Hossain, foreign affairs adviser to Yunus, says India failed to recalibrate, missing a chance to reset ties with the interim government. ""We tried to go forward on a number of occasions, but then the response from India was on again, off again,"" he told me.
India, for its part, has voiced concern over Bangladesh's ""deteriorating security environment"" and called for ""free, fair, inclusive and credible elections"" conducted peacefully.
Political strain is now spilling into economic ties. Bilateral trade of $13.5bn could be far higher if tariff and non-tariff barriers were eased and diplomatic relations improved, says Fahmida Khatun of the think tank Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD). ""Political tension has led to economic tension.""
Yet this hardening at the state level does not always translate neatly on the street.
""Whenever I hear India, I think it is my enemy,"" says Fatima Tasnim Juma of Inquilab Mancha, a cultural platform known for its nationalist anti-India messaging.
""But when it comes to people, it does not work like that."" Juma says she grew up in a Hindu-majority area; relatives move easily across the border. ""Our conflict is with the Indian government or the structure. Not with people.""
Anti-Indianism has been notably subdued on the campaign trail - not because it has faded, but because every political contender knows that a reset with India is unavoidable.
Even so, repairing India–Bangladesh ties will not be quick - or cosmetic.
""A reset won't be easy simply because there's an election or a new government. The background [issues] will remain,"" says Alam.
Still, the rupture is not irreversible. ""No state relationship is,"" says Riaz - but the burden of repair, he argues, lies largely with Delhi and will require moving beyond the habit of managing Dhaka through favoured intermediaries. Ahmed says Bangladesh is open to normalising ties, but India needs a reset that works with whoever holds power in Dhaka.
Political figures frame the reset in moral as much as strategic terms.
Mahdi Amin, a key adviser to BNP leader Rahman, puts it bluntly: ""The bigger the nation, the more the responsibility.""
People-to-people ties, he argues, can only grow if India aligns its policy with the aspirations of Bangladeshis, not just the preferences of governments.
Jamaat-e-Islami's assistant general secretary Ahsanul Mehboob Zubair offers a cautious echo: ""If those in charge in both countries act with sincerity, accept present realities, and treat each other with mutual respect and dignity, a constructive relationship is possible.""
That space for repair still exists - and a new government could make a difference.
""The current situation is more than a diplomatic chill, and less than a structural break,"" notes Paliwal.
""Geography, history, and shared cultural heritage means that India and Bangladesh cannot wish away each other.""

"Who is Jimmy Lai, Hong Kong's pro-democracy tycoon?",2026-02-09T04:02:26.230Z," Kelly Ng
BBC News
Singapore
","Hong Kong's pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for colluding with foreign forces under the city's controversial national security law.
The 78-year-old, who was convicted in December, is the most prominent person to be charged under the contentious law. It was introduced by China in 2020, in response to massive pro-democracy protests which erupted in Hong Kong the year before.
The law criminalises anything Beijing deems to be subversive or secessionist, from chanting slogans to participating in pro-democracy protests. Beijing says it is necessary to maintain stability in Hong Kong but critics say it has effectively outlawed dissent.
Hailed a hero by the pro-democracy movement, Lai has long been viewed as a traitor by Hong Kong authorities and Beijing. He emerged as a key critic of China and his Apple Daily newspaper became a platform for Hongkongers who wanted more freedom.
When the sentence was read out in court on Monday, Lai, who has been detained since December 2020, smiled calmly and nodded. He has always denied the charges against him, saying he had fought for the freedoms that he believed were Hong Kong's values.
Hong Kong says Lai has been given a fair trial under the rule of law, but critics say his case shows how the city's legal system has been used to silence political opposition.
His family has voiced concerns about his deteriorating health in detention. This August, his son Sebastien told the BBC that even if his father - a British citizen - got just five years in prison, it was ""practically the same as a death penalty.""
Rights groups on Monday also criticised the sentence, saying it was ""effectively a death sentence"" given Lai's age.
Sebastien also criticised UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for not securing Lai's release when he visited China in January. The ""values [that the UK stands for] are being locked up along with my father,"" he said.
Lai became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory.
""I'm a born rebel,"" he told the BBC in an interview in 2020, hours before he was charged. ""I have a very rebellious character.""
Lai was born in Guangzhou, a city in southern China, to a wealthy family that lost everything when the communists took power in 1949.
He was 12 years old when he fled his village in mainland China, arriving in Hong Kong as a stowaway on a fishing boat.
While working odd jobs and knitting in a small clothing shop he taught himself English. He went from a menial role to eventually founding a multi-million dollar empire including the international clothing brand Giordano.
The chain was a huge success. But when China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur.
He started writing columns criticising the massacre that followed the demonstrations in Beijing and established a publishing house that went on to become one of Hong Kong's most influential.
As China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland, leading him to sell the company, Lai launched a string of popular pro-democracy titles that included Next, a digital magazine, and the widely read Apple Daily newspaper.
In a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Lai had been a persistent critic of Chinese authorities both through his publications and writing.
This has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of the city.
But on the mainland he is viewed as a ""traitor"" who threatens Chinese national security.
In recent years, masked attackers firebombed Lai's house and company headquarters. He was also the target of an assassination plot.
But none of the threats stopped him from airing his views robustly. He was a prominent part of the city's pro-democracy demonstrations and was arrested twice in 2021 on illegal assembly charges.
When China passed Hong Kong's new national security law in June 2020, Lai told the BBC it sounded the ""death knell"" for the territory.
The media mogul is known for his frankness and acts of flamboyance.
In 2021, he urged Donald Trump to help the territory, saying he was ""the only one who can save us"" from China. His newspaper, Apple Daily, published a front-page letter that finished: ""Mr President, please help us.""
For Lai, such acts were necessary to defend the city which had taken him in and fuelled his success.
He once told news agency AFP: ""I came here with nothing, the freedom of this place has given me everything... Maybe it's time I paid back for that freedom by fighting for it.""
Lai has been charged with various offences - including unauthorised assembly and fraud - since 2020.
The prosecution of Lai has captured international attention, with rights groups and foreign governments urging his release.
Over the years, Sebastien Lai has travelled the world to denounce his father's arrest and condemn Hong Kong for punishing ""characteristics that should be celebrated"".
""My father is in jail for the truth on his lips, courage in his heart, and freedom in his soul,"" he had said.

","On a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.
They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory.
They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.
In prison, he ""loved eating rice with pickled ginger,"" Chan said. ""No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!""
But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname ""Fatty Lai"": he had lost considerable weight.
Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy.
That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.
Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave.
""I got everything I have because of this place,"" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. ""This is my redemption,"" he said, choking up.
He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.
Lai harboured ""a rabid hatred"" of the Chinese Communist Party and ""an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world"", the High Court ruled in December when it convicted him.
It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.
Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied, including sedition under a separate colonial-era law. The most serious one, colluding with foreign forces, carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
On 9 February, the court jailed him for 20 years in a hearing that lasted less than 30 minutes. It is the harshest sentence given so far under the NSL - ""an effective death sentence"", given his age, according to rights groups.
""Never,"" Lai had said to the charge of collusion when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: ""rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly"".
His conviction in December was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to ""wantonly create social conflicts"" and ""glorify violence"". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country ""under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom"".
Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.
Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. ""Even though he was suffering,"" Wong said, ""he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.""
Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.
For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.
Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.
From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the ""adult section"" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a ""buffet"" targeting ""a full range of readers"", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - ""If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it"" - and his temper. One said he often swore.
They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. ""Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,"" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. ""It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.""
It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. ""He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,"" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.
That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: ""Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.""
An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.
It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.
It was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.
After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. ""I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,"" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.
Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist ""class enemies"". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.
Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: ""My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.""
Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: ""You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!""
And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.
The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a ""very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future"". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.
By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.
Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. ""People's spontaneous reaction"" and ""the exchange of information"" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.
The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired. ""I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,"" he said in a 2009 interview.
After a decade in manufacturing, he was ""bored"" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.
Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was ""excited"", China ""was going to be changed, like a Western country"", he said in the 2007 documentary.
Then in 1989, Beijing crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.
Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.
A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.
Lai said later that he ""didn't feel anything about China"" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but ""all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night"".
The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, ""the Butcher of Beijing"" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him ""the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence"".
Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.
""If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,"" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.
He soon became a ""very active participant"" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.
He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: ""I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties."" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997.
""After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,"" he wrote. ""But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?""
During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.
The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.
Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. ""When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,"" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.
The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.
What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.
Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: ""To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.""
Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.
Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was ""instrumental"" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a ""totally false"" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which ""caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong"".
Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.
Lai instructed the editorial team to ""urge people to take to the streets"", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.
During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to ""save Hong Kong"".
All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.
""Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,"" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 ""are totally against common sense"".
Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from ""chaos to governance"" and onto ""greater prosperity"" because of the national security law and a ""patriot-only"" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.
Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: ""When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?""
Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.
Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but ""they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy"".
She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai.
""If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?""

Japan's PM Takaichi on course to win snap election by landslide,2026-02-08T23:43:59.624Z," Shaimaa Khalil
Tokyo correspondent
andJosh Cheetham
","Japan's ruling party, led by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, is on course to win Sunday's snap election by a landslide.
The coalition led by Takaichi's Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) has won 352 of 465 seats in Japan's House of Representatives, figures collated by public broadcaster NHK suggest, with the LDP alone securing a majority of 316.
The country's first female prime minister had sought a clear public mandate by calling the election just four months after becoming party leader.
Her apparent success is in marked contrast to her two predecessors, under whom the party lost its parliamentary majority due to corruption scandals and rising costs.
Takaichi previously pledged to step down if her party failed to secure a majority, and some called the snap election a big gamble.
The LDP lost its majority in both houses of parliament in 2024, and its decades-old coalition with the Komeito party collapsed.
But Takaichi's personal popularity appears to have helped the party, with approval ratings for her government mostly hovering above 70%.
The LDP's current coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, is thought to have secured 36 seats, with opposition parties winning a combined 113 seats, according to NHK figures.
When officially confirmed, the election success will give Takaichi wide scope to push through her conservative agenda.
US President Donald Trump has already congratulated Takaichi on the projected victory, describing her as a ""highly respected and very popular"" leader.
""I wish you Great Success in passing your Conservative, Peace Through Strength Agenda,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
He added: ""The wonderful people of Japan, who voted with such enthusiasm, will always have my strong support.""
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hailed a ""big victory"" for Takaichi, saying ""when Japan is strong, the US is strong in Asia"".
Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi also congratulated Takaichi for the ""landmark"" result, saying he was confident India and Japan's friendship could be taken to ""greater heights"".
People across Japan braved snow to vote in the country's first mid-winter poll in 36 years.
Japan's transport ministry said 37 train lines and 58 ferry routes were closed and 54 flights cancelled as of Sunday morning. There was rare snowfall in Tokyo as people headed out to vote.
""People want their lives to be better and more comfortable because we are so accustomed to not having inflation [costs rising]... so people are very worried. I think we need a long-term solution rather than short-term fixes,"" Ritsuko Ninomiya, a voter in Tokyo, told the BBC.
Takaichi's enthusiasm, populist spending promises and nationalist rhetoric appear to have energised voters.
Her social media presence has also cultivated new followers, particularly among young voters. She regularly shares clips of her daily life and political activities, and a video of her playing the drums with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung is one of many clips to have gone viral.
""I think this election is more important for the younger generation, people like us,"" Daniel Hayama said, adding that the cold weather was not a hurdle for young people who want to vote.
Takaichi and the LDP faced a more unified opposition than before. LDP's former coalition partner Komeito has joined forces with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan to form the largest opposition bloc in the lower house.
Takaichi has pushed to toughen the immigration system, review rules around foreign ownership of Japanese land, and tackle any non-payments of tax and health insurance by foreign nationals.
But in a country where only 3% of the population are foreign nationals, critics have accused her of creating anxiety and division.
Critics, including businesses, are sceptical that her pledge to spend more and cut taxes can revive the sluggish Japanese economy. The country's government debt is already one of the highest among developed nations.
Relations with China - Japan's largest trading partner - have been strained as well, after Takaichi suggested last November that Japan could intervene militarily if China invaded Taiwan.
With a two-thirds majority, Takaichi would be in a strong position to consider her long-held aim of changing Japan's pacifist constitution.
Takaichi has courted Trump, who has publicly endorsed her - an unusual move by a US president - and they both seem to agree that Japan should spend more on defence.
That relationship too was on voters' minds as they headed to the polls on Sunday.
""I am concerned with what President Trump is doing as well as the national defence issues. I am not sure where the money is coming from to cover that. So balancing budget spending between defence and people's life is a major concern for me,"" Yuko Sakai says.

Thai PM claims election victory with conservatives well ahead of rivals,2026-02-08T19:22:29.967Z," Jonathan Head
South East Asia correspondent
BangkokandThanyarat Doksone
Bangkok
","Prime Minister Anutin Charnavirakul has claimed victory in Thailand's general election, with preliminary vote counts putting his ruling conservatives well ahead of their rivals.
Anutin said his success belonged to ""all Thais, no matter whether you voted for us or not"", after his party's expected result defied opinion polls that had placed the reformist People's Party ahead.
With 90% of the votes counted, Anutin's Bhumjaithai party is projected to win 194 seats in Bangkok's 500-seat parliament, with the People's Party in second place on 116.
People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut appeared to concede the election, saying he was ready to serve in opposition if Anutin could form a government.
The election was called in December after the coalition led by Anutin collapsed after just three months.
While no party is projected to gain an overall majority, Anutin is now almost certain to stay in office, with his Bhumjaithai likely to have more than double the number of seats it won in the last election in 2023.
Elections in Thailand are often unpredictable, and so it proved this time.
This shock result is a huge disappointment for the People's Party, which had expected to improve on its winning performance three years ago.
But a widely expected ""orange wave"" of support for its young, idealistic candidates did not materialise.
The party, which under a different name Move Forward won the election in 2023, but was blocked from taking power by the unelected senate, found itself pushed into second place this time by Anutin's pragmatic conservatives.
The reformists will remain in opposition for now. The feared crisis that could have occurred had they won, and once again been barred from office, has been averted.
Opinion polls have frequently been wrong in Thailand, but there will be a lot of post-election analysis of how Anutin turned his once small, provincial Bhumjaithai - ""Thai Pride""- party into such a formidable electoral machine.
Playing on patriotic sentiment after the two short border wars with Cambodia last year, Anutin's party became the standard-bearer for conservatives, promising to defend the status of traditional Thai institutions like the monarchy and military.
He campaigned on hard-line nationalist sentiments and populist giveaways - but his victory was also down to his ability to win local power-brokers to his side, in an electoral system where 80% of seats were decided in individual constituencies on a first-past-the-post basis, with the remaining 20% allocated on the proportion of the vote won at a national level.
He also broadened the appeal of his party by putting well-known technocrats with reputations for competence at the heart of his campaign.
The People's Party did much better in the proportional votes, but appears to have lost some of the support it had in 2023, and was unable to overcome its lack of networks at a local level.
The third main contender was the Shinawatra family and its Pheu Thai – ""For Thais"" – party, which is projected to win 86 seats, a huge drop from its 2023 result.
In the past it dominated elections, with well-marketed populist policies. It formed a coalition administration after Move Forward was blocked in 2023, but had two of its prime ministers dismissed by the notoriously interventionist constitutional court.
Its standing in Thailand was damaged by accusations it had mishandled the conflict with Cambodia, and by its patriarch, former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, being sent to jail last September.
The state of the economy was uppermost in many voters' minds, with household debt at record levels and growth far lower than in previous years.
""I want the economy to improve and I don't want big factories to relocate to our neighbouring countries,"" civil servant Phananya Bunthong told the BBC, a reference to Thailand falling behind Vietnam.
The People's Party promised big changes, from curbing the power of the biggest businesses and military, to streamlining the extensive bureaucracy and modernising the education system. In the eight years since the movement was founded its radical agenda has been popular with younger Thais.
""I want change. I don't want things to be the same,"" 28-year-old Kittitat Daengkongkho told the BBC.
But it is clear from the result that this time that agenda was less successful among older people and those in the provinces, than the simpler promises of financial assistance made by Anutin's party.
Alongside the election, Thais also voted in a referendum on whether to reform the 2017 constitution, which was drafted under military rule in 2017.
Critics of the charter believe it gives too much power to unelected institutions like the courts and senate, ""handcuffing"" the country's democracy.
With over 90% of votes counted, preliminary tallies suggested around 65% had voted in favour.

From classroom to camera: A teacher who has become a sensation in Indian cinema,2026-02-08T00:57:50.283Z," Sudha G Tilak
","At 70, Biana Watre Momin took a leap far from home.
The retired college teacher left the Garo Hills in north-eastern India's Meghalaya state, where she led a quiet family life - caring for four dogs and doting on her grandchildren - and travelled more than 3,000km (1,864 miles) south to Kerala to act in a film.
She was dealing with a language she did not understand, embracing a role whose meaning would only reveal itself once the camera began to roll.
The film was Eko, a Malayalam-language film that would change the course of her life.
For Momin, a member of the Garo tribe - one of the indigenous communities of Meghalaya, a largely tribal state - acting had never been an ambition, or even a distant curiosity.
""Growing up, my town did not have a cinema or theatre,"" she told the BBC. She was never trained in the performing arts, ""unless you'd call teaching in a classroom a kind of performance"", she adds with a laugh.
A retired English literature teacher from Tura Government College, with a fondness for Romantic poetry, Momin had little reason to believe that a camera would one day frame her face. Yet when Eko entered her life, it offered an unexpected adventure.
""I was initially hesitant as I had no experience in acting and was concerned about the long travel from home,"" she says. ""But my daughter nudged me, saying, 'Have faith in yourself and try something new.'""
In Eko, a title that plays on the word ""echo"", Momin plays Mlathi Chettathi, an enigmatic elder living alone in the Western Ghats, a vast mountain range along India's western coast known for its dense forests and mist-covered hills. As the film's lead, her presence anchors its fog-laced landscape and moral core.
Shot on a modest budget and completed in 45 days, Eko, showing on Netflix, has emerged as a critical success.
Much of the intrigue surrounding the film centres on Momin's performance, both for its quiet power and for her unusual profile.
Director Dinjith Ayyathan was searching for a fresh face to play an elderly Malay woman who flees Malaysia during the Japanese invasion of World War II and arrives in Kerala accompanied by men with hidden motives.
Over decades, she lives alone in a crumbling house atop a forested mountain, sharing her world with feral dogs and drifting clouds, while men claiming friendship and family ties attempt to unravel the mystery around her.
The search for the right actor led the Eko team to reach out to friends in the fledgeling film industry and even the Indian army stationed across the eight north-eastern states, looking for someone whose features might plausibly pass as Malay.
It was then that images and clips of Momin, who had recently appeared in a short film on Garo folklore exploring the transformation of human souls into animals, found their way to the Kerala-based scouting team.
""It seems an unusual coincidence that a short film involving animals led me to a role also set in the company of animals,"" Momin says.
On a rainy day, she travelled with her son to meet the director and writer for an audition.
""We gave her a fictitious situation: approaching police officers to report her missing son,"" says Eko's writer and cinematographer Bahul Ramesh. ""Her spontaneity, emotive restraint and quiet confidence stood out immediately. Her courage to move far from home and attempt something entirely new at this age won us over.""
Though often described as an eco-mystery or psychological thriller, Eko resists easy categorisation - and so does Mlathi Chettathi. She is neither ornament nor mystical cliché. Instead, she carries a quiet authority, observant and grounded.
""I am proud, as an indigenous person, that there are creative people willing to take a chance on me at this age,"" Momin says. ""I hope it inspires more representation.""
Ramesh describes her performance as ""organic and intuitive"". ""What was extraordinary was her fearlessness and stepping onto a film set for the first time at 70,"" he says.
For Momin, the shoot was an education.
""Suddenly, I was a student again,"" she says. She learnt her Malayalam lines phonetically with help from a language coach, followed position cues, absorbed emotional beats and adapted to the rhythm of a professional film set.
Although her dialogue was later dubbed by a local voice artist, Momin memorised and delivered her lines during filming. The shoot involved long treks up a mountain each day, unpredictable weather, veteran actors, heavy equipment and frequent rushes to beat the rain and descending clouds.
""I am a strong woman,"" she says. ""I didn't fall sick despite the weather, and I was adventurous enough to try the cuisine in Kerala.""
Crew members say they were struck by her sharp grasp of emotion, angles and movement. Momin credits her life experience. ""I have lived a full life and could draw from that,"" she says. ""I also come from a matrilineal tribe, similar to Kerala, and my feminism informed my approach to the role.""
Ramesh agrees. ""This is a self-reliant character who outwits those trying to exploit her with silent grit and steely determination. Momin slipped into this feminist folklore with quiet understanding.""
Accolades have followed her, with national award-winning Tamil actor Dhanush calling it a ""world-class performance"".
Following Eko's success, filmmakers from Bollywood and beyond have approached Momin with scripts. ""Talks are on,"" she says carefully. ""Acting is strenuous work. Let's see what surprises are in store.""
For the time being, Momin has returned to her life at home, keeping busy with her family and her book club. ""We'll be discussing Arundhati Roy's Mother Mary Comes to Me this week,"" she says cheerfully.
Biana Momin did not become an actor in the conventional sense. What she became instead was a reminder that cinema, at its best, does not manufacture truth but learns to recognise it.
""Old age should burn and rage at close of day,"" she quotes Dylan Thomas, momentarily sounding like the teacher she once was.

Pakistan's famous kite festival cautiously returns after 19-year ban,2026-02-08T00:01:49.979Z," Caroline Davies
Pakistan correspondent
Lahore
","In the streets of Lahore, there are hints that the kite flying festival, Basant, has returned.
Someone is fishing a kite from electricity cables, the distant sound of a drum beat, a flash of neon when you look up in the walled city's narrow streets to a stretch of sky. This party is above.
As the sun sets across the city, on every rooftop we can see families and friends, laughing, shouting, watching as kites zig zag, circle, and soar through the city's skies.
""It's really difficult!"" Abu Bakar Ahmad tells me.
The 25-year-old tech engineer has been coached by his cousin, coaxing the kite higher and higher with a twitch of the string.
""All our generations here are very excited; the elders know how to fly a kite, but we Gen-Zers don't know.""
The festival has returned after nearly two decades. Marking the start of spring, it dates back centuries, but was banned in 2007 after several years of injuries and fatalities caused by sharp kite strings, falls and aerial firing.
It means for many this is their first time flying; they've never seen the skies above Lahore like this. Others are practising the skill after years.
""It's gathering, it's love. Flying kites is ok, but the main thing is bonding,"" Kanwal Amin, 48, tells me. ""I like watching and eating good food.""
Kashif Siddiqui is a pharmacist, but admits his kite flying is a bit rusty. He shows me pictures of his last Basant - then Kashif's son was three. Now his son is here with his own children.
""It's special for Lahori's - this runs in our blood. It's not about kite and thread, it's about tradition. My father and his father before him used to do it.""
Kashif's aunt, Mina Sikander, 60, is here from Miami; she didn't want to miss out.
""I'm very fond of this festival,"" she says. ""It was worth the journey!""
Kite flying is not just about beauty, it's about the battle to knock your opponent's kite out of the sky by cutting their string.
That led to ever sharper, stronger threads, some coated in powdered glass, others made from metal or chemical material that would not break.
Each festival there were deaths, including of children. It was particularly dangerous for motorcyclists who could inadvertently drive into a thread draped across a road, cutting their throats.
Celebratory aerial firing and falls from rooftops also caused injuries and fatalities.
In a bid to try to make the festival safer, it's now been limited to only three days.
Motorcyclists have been given metal rods, sticking up between their handlebars, to stop any threads they drive into from becoming tied around their necks.
Large kites are banned because they require a stronger string and create a bigger risk, the authorities say.
Nets have been placed over certain streets; in previous years metal kite strings have fallen on to electricity wires giving an electric shock to anyone holding them - and causing the wires to short circuit.
To prevent anyone flying before the festival officially began any kites sold before February 1 were seized along with any string deemed dangerous.
Faisal Kamran, Deputy Inspector General of Lahore Police, shows us some of more than 100,000 kites and 2,100 rolls of string he says his team seized.
His officers are monitoring the skies and rooftops through drones, officers watching in person and repositioned CCTV cameras.
""All these cameras were covering our main roads,"" he says pointing to images now looking across Lahore's rooftops. ""We have a good view just to keep a check on activities like if somebody is using that banned material or weapons.""
He says the cameras will be turned back to the roads when Basant is over.
Many are hoping the measures are a success, not least the Punjab government who decided to bring Basant back and have been promoting it.
In the narrow streets of Mochi gate, customers hold their paper kites overhead to stop them getting ripped as they squeeze through the crowd and past the occasional slow moving motorbike.
Usman, one of the kite sellers, tells me he's sold more than 7000 kites in just a few days.
Yousaf Salahuddin has been one of the festival's key supporters and advocates for decades.
In the 1980s he hosted the glitterati of Pakistan at the festival and invited the media to cover it to raise its profile. He says it makes a financial difference to the city too.
""There was a lot of revenue,"" Yousaf says. ""And that revenue was going down to the poorest - the vendors on the street, the restaurants in the old city, the people who dyed the clothes, the people who were selling shoes, bangles, everything.
""And then the hotels were all booked, there were extra flights coming in.""
His first memories of the festival date back to before he was old enough to fly kites, when instead he would rush across the rooftops to catch the kites whose strings had been cut.
Yousaf felt emotional seeing them back in Lahore's skies in such numbers for the first time this weekend.
""It's always been a part of us, I don't remember the city without kites,"" he says.
That doesn't mean he wants to fly them though.
""I don't have the patience, I flew one last night and it got cut,"" Yousaf says. ""So I said, 'I'm not flying anymore - I'm done!'""

Alleged mastermind among four arrested after Pakistan mosque blast,2026-02-07T17:58:37.714Z," Ian Aikman
","Four people have been arrested on suspicion of facilitating a suicide bombing that killed more than 30 people on Friday, Pakistan's interior minister has said.
Mohsin Naqvi said an Afghan national who is alleged to be the mastermind behind the attack was among those detained. One counter-terrorism officer was killed and three more were wounded in the raids to arrest the suspects, he added.
The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the bombing that targeted Friday prayers at the Shia mosque in the Tarlai area, when it was packed with worshippers.
More than 160 people were injured in the blast, which was the deadliest in the capital for more than a decade.
Huge crowds were seen in the city on Saturday, as thousands of mourners gathered for the funerals of the bombing's 32 victims.
Funeral prayers took place amid tightened security, with soldiers standing guard and police checkpoints set up in key areas.
Ashiq Hussain, who lost his 21-year-old nephew Mujtaba Ali in the attack, told the Reuters news agency his family was ""broken"".
Condemning the attack on Friday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed ""deep grief"". The country's President, Asif Ali Zardari, said ""targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity"".
Eyewitnesses and survivors of the blast have told the BBC how the attack unfolded, with one saying he ""lost his senses"" in the moments after the explosion and another saying he saw bodies ""lying everywhere"".
Announcing the arrests on Saturday, Naqvi accused India of funding those behind the attack and giving them targets. The Indian foreign ministry has condemned the bombing, and rejected accusations of its involvement as ""baseless"".
Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday suggested Afghanistan had been involved in the attack. The Afghan Taliban government described Asif's comments as ""regrettable"", saying he alleged its involvement ""without presenting any credible evidence"".
Naqvi has pledged to increase security in Islamabad, including by recruiting thousands of new police officers and improving the city's smart security systems.
Attacks are relatively rare in the capital, although one in November left 12 dead and another 27 injured.
The blast on Friday comes after a week of violence which saw 58 civilians killed in coordinated attacks in the province of Balochistan.
The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group said it was behind the attacks. The military - which has been fighting an insurgency in the region for decades - said it had killed more than 200 militants in response.

S Korean crypto firm accidentally pays out $40bn in bitcoin,2026-02-07T13:56:49.877Z," Rachel Muller-Heyndyk
","A South Korean cryptocurrency exchange accidentally gave away more than $40bn (£32bn) worth of bitcoin to customers, briefly making them multi-millionaires.
It had planned to give customers a small cash reward of 2,000 won - $1.37 - but instead gave them 2,000 bitcoins on Friday.
The platform, Bithumb, apologised for the error, adding that it quickly had realised its mistake and recovered almost all the missing tokens.
It said it had restricted trading and withdrawals for the 695 affected customers within 35 minutes of the glitch.
The company said it had recovered 99.7% of the 620,000 bitcoins mistakenly sent.
""We want to make it clear that this matter has nothing to do with external hacking or security breaches, and there is no problem with system security or customer asset management,"" Bithumb said in a statement on Friday.
In an emergency meeting on Saturday, South Korea's financial regulator said it would look into the incident. Any sign of illegal activity would prompt formal investigations, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).
Bithumb vowed to co-operate with regulators. ""[We] will take this accident as a lesson and prioritise 'customer trust and peace of mind' rather than external growth,"" CEO Lee Jae-won said.
The company plans to pay 20,000 won ($13.66; £10.04) in compensation to all customers who were using the platform at the time, and will waive trading fees, among other measures.
Bithumb said it would improve verification systems and introduce AI to detect abnormal transactions.
The incident is likely to spark discussion around tighter regulatory controls in finance.
In April 2024 Citigroup, a US bank, mistakenly credited $81 trillion, instead of $280, to a customer's account. Two employees failed to spot the error before it was processed, but the bank reversed the transaction within hours after a third employee caught the mistake, the Financial Times reported.

At the scene of deadly Pakistan mosque explosion,2026-02-07T03:23:10.275Z,No Author Listed,
The retired Indian factory worker who built a library of two million books,2026-02-07T00:42:45.194Z," Imran Qureshi
Mandya district
Karnataka
","Two million books, housed across a sprawling building, free for anyone to borrow and read.
That's the wealth that Anke Gowda, a retired sugar factory worker from India's southern Karnataka state, has accumulated over the past five decades.
The 79-year-old made headlines last month when he received the Padma Shri - a civilian honour awarded by the federal government - for his extraordinary contribution to promoting literacy and learning.
Gowda - whose eye-popping collection includes rare editions of the Bible, along with books on every subject imaginable - comes from a farming family where books were a luxury.
""I grew up in a village. We never got books to read, but I was always curious about them. I kept thinking that I should read, gather books and gain knowledge,"" he told the BBC.
Gowda's library is located in Pandavapura, a small municipality in Karnataka's Mandya district. It lacks the rigid organisation usually associated with libraries. In fact, Gowda's collection doesn't have a librarian and books are stacked on shelves and piled on the floor in a haphazard manner.
Outside, under the library's awnings are sacks filled with an estimated 800,000 books, still waiting to be unpacked. The collection is still growing, through Gowda's purchases and donations from others.
The place is frequented by students, their parents, teachers and book lovers. Regular visitors seem to know their way around the library and find the books they need with ease. And even if they can't, they say, Gowda can find anything.
Gowda, his wife and son live in a corner of the library, which is open every day of the week - and for long hours.
Gowda spent his childhood juggling school and helping his father with farm work. He would often ask his parents and elder sister for money to buy books.
When he began reading books about Indian freedom fighters and spiritual leaders, he got hooked.
""They were like candy,"" he says.
Inspired by a teacher, he started building a small collection of books so that other students from rural areas could also read.
He often used the money his parents gave him for food to buy books instead.
Soon after finishing school, he started working as a bus conductor.
One day, about 10 months into the job, he bumped into a former teacher who was shocked to hear that he had quit studying. He insisted that Gowda resign and go to college.
Gowda followed his advice and went on to get a postgraduate degree in Kannada (the official language of Karnataka), before joining the Pandavapura sugar factory as a timekeeper.
He would spend two-thirds of his monthly salary on books, and use the remaining money for groceries and other necessities.
""Salaries were low then, but prices were also low,"" he says.
Over the 33 years he worked at the factory, Gowda attended dozens of conferences of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat - a non-profit dedicated to developing the local language and literature - and would often buy discounted books from them.
He also augmented his income by raising cows and selling milk, and working as an insurance agent.
His next hurdle would be familiar to book lovers everywhere - finding space to house his overflowing collection.
""I started keeping the books in trunks [large metal boxes]. Then I installed bookshelves in my house. But at one point, there was no place left,"" he says.
At the time, he had acquired around 50,000 books.
Help came when some of his friends met Hari Khoday, the late liquor baron who was building a temple in Pandavapura.
Khoday, recalls Gowda, couldn't believe that one man could own so many books.
""He came and saw the books for himself. Then he asked me what I needed. I told him I didn't want any money for myself. My only request was that he build a library,"" Gowda says.
Khoday agreed and paid for the construction of a huge building, which is now part of Gowda's sprawling library which stretches across 15,800 sq ft (1,467 sq m).
Some years later, a local lawmaker brought then Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy to see the library and he authorised money for the construction of two more structures attached to the first one.
Today, students and teachers from across the state visit the library. Among them is Ravi Bettaswami, an assistant professor at a private college who says that he has also been inspired to build a collection of thousands of books.
""I have used Gowda's library to study and have taken my students there so they could read and also help organise the books,"" he says.
Shilpashree Haranu, who teaches at a government college, says that the collection may look messy as it has not been organised by a professional librarian.
""But he [Gowda] knows exactly where each book is and can tell you in an instant,"" she says.
When asked why he never hired a librarian, Gowda says no-one ever suggested that to him.
As for the future of the library, Gowda strikes a philosophical note, suggesting that it is now up to others to take his legacy forward.
""I have fulfilled my responsibility. But I don't have the energy anymore. Maybe the government and the public can take over now?
""I have done my best, now it is up to others.""

"More than 30 killed in blast at Pakistan mosque, officials say",2026-02-07T00:35:37.580Z," Shahzad Malik and Umer Draz

Islamabad and London
","At least 32 people have been killed and more than 160 injured in an explosion at a mosque during Friday prayers in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, officials say.
A suicide bomber detonated a device after approaching the Shia mosque in the Tarlai area of the city, police said.
The Islamic State (IS) group claimed the attack, in a statement posted on its Telegram channel seen by the BBC. The group also issued a picture of the alleged bomber.
Condemning the attack, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed ""deep grief"". The country's president, Asif Ali Zardari, said ""targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity"".
Before the claim by IS, Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif suggested India and Afghanistan had been behind the attack.
Asif said in a social media post that it had been ""proven"" the attacker had travelled to and from Afghanistan, and ""collusion between India and Afghanistan is being revealed"".
Afghanistan's Taliban government described Asif's comments as ""regrettable"", saying the Pakistani minister ""hastily attempted to attribute the incident to Afghanistan without presenting any credible evidence"".
Afghan foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi earlier called such attacks a ""contradiction to Islamic and humanitarian values"".
The Indian foreign ministry also condemned the bombing, calling the accusations it may be involved ""baseless"".
A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he condemned the attack in the ""strongest terms"" and called for those responsible to be ""identified and brought to justice"".
Zaheer Abbas was inside the Khadijatul Kubra Mosque praying when he first heard the sound of bullets.
""After that, we bowed and then prostrated, and then there was an explosion,"" he told BBC Urdu. ""After which there were injured people lying everywhere.""
Pictures from the mosque in the aftermath show footwear scattered across the floor, shattered glass, and people sat among the wreckage.
Abbas, who said he ""lost his senses"" in the moments after the explosion, was eventually pulled out by emergency services and taken to hospital, where he was quickly released.
""Fortunately, I did not suffer much injury,"" he said.
According to Pakistan's defence minister, the attacker opened fire and detonated the bomb after being challenged by security guards.
The mosque's caretaker Syed Ashfaq - who lives next door - also heard gunfire, and began running towards the mosque to help.
""By the time I reached it there had already been an explosion,"" he told the BBC. ""Bodies were lying everywhere, some were missing arms, some missing legs. We took the most injured in our own vehicle [to hospital].""
Islamabad's deputy commissioner Irfan Memon said on X that the death toll stood at 31, with the injured numbering 169.
Pictures from local hospitals show the injured being brought by private vehicles and ambulances, with one photographer for news agency AFP saying they saw dozens of people arriving at hospital.
Attacks are relatively rare in the capital, although one in November left 12 dead. Another 27 were injured in the blast, outside a courthouse.
The blast on Friday comes after a week of violence which saw 58 civilians killed in coordinated attacks in the province of Balochistan.
The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group said it was behind the attacks. The military - which has been fighting an insurgency in the region for decades - said it had killed more than 200 militants in response.
Last year was also Pakistan's deadliest in over a decade as combat-related deaths surged 74%, with militants accounting for more than half the death toll, according to a new report released by an independent think tank.
The Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) said violence in Pakistan left 3,413 people dead - up from 1,950 in 2024 - with 2,138 militants killed.
IS claimed the attack in the name of its ""Pakistan Province"" branch on Friday, via the group's Telegram channels. IS's Amaq ""news agency"" issued a statement offering additional details.
Amaq alleged that the IS attacker arrived at the ""central temple [mosque]"" in Tarlai district in the Shahzad area. Guards at the location then tried to halt the attacker at the external gate, it claimed, but he fired his pistol at them, injuring two, before heading inside.
IS said the alleged attacker was named ""Sayf Allah al-Ansari"". The nom de guerre Ansari is often used to indicate somebody who is a local to the area. Amaq's report also shared a photo showing what it said was the alleged masked attacker.

They were drawn to Korea with dreams of K-pop stardom - but then let down,2026-02-06T23:05:12.585Z," Hyojung Kim
SeoulandDavid Oh
Seoul
","As K-pop's popularity soars, South Korea has become a destination for young people around the world hoping to break into the industry.
And many take that chance each year to enroll in programmes promising a path to stardom.
That hope brought Miyu to South Korea in 2024. Her name has been changed to protect her identity.
Armed with big dreams, the teen paid 3m yen ($19,800; £14,500) to join a six-month programme at a K-pop training academy in Seoul. In return, she was to be given professional dance and vocal lessons and the opportunity to audition for major music agencies.
""There were supposed to be weekly auditions, but that never happened,"" Miyu told the BBC on a street in Hongdae, a neighbourhood in Seoul known for its music scene.
Lessons were few and far between, she said, and she also alleged she was sexually harassed by a senior staff member. The company, which we have not named for legal reasons, has denied all allegations.
Miyu's allegations - and those of others at the academy - shed light on an under-regulated industry where the promise of opportunity often comes with risk.
The BBC spoke to two other trainees who attended the same academy. One of them also alleged sexual harassment by the same staff member, while the third said she had witnessed inappropriate behaviour towards others, but she hadn't experienced it herself.
All of them said the programme had promised audition opportunities, which did not happen.
The company denied this, saying there were opportunities to audition, and added that nearly 200 foreign trainees had participated in its programmes since it opened in the late 2010s.
K-pop training institutes are usually classified either as Hagwon, or private academies, which are regulated by the education department, or as entertainment agencies.
The company Miyu attended is registered as the latter, putting it outside South Korea's education laws. Instead, it is one of some 5,800 agencies overseen by the Ministry of Culture, whose regulatory powers are far more limited.
Their training programmes are not subject to regulation or inspection, a local official told the BBC.
An official from the Ministry of Education told the BBC that current regulations did not restrict travel and entertainment agencies from teaching language and dance to foreign nationals, so it was difficult to regulate such ""academy-type agencies"".
""I dreamed of becoming an idol - but what I went through felt more like a scam,"" Miyu, who is still a teen, said.
""[This is] where I pursued my dream, but it also brings back my trauma.""
Miyu was drawn to K-pop in middle school.
It was Lisa - the Thai rapper-singer who arrived in Korea as a teen and shot to global fame with the K-pop girl group Blackpink - who inspired her journey.
Lisa is far from an anomaly in K-pop today. Twice has three Japanese members and one Taiwanese member, and NewJeans has a Vietnamese-Australian singer. Hearts2Heart, which debuted last year, includes the country's first Indonesian idol.
But making it to the top, like they have, is tough in what has become a cutthroat K-pop industry. A handful of powerful agencies run the show, which means they have to bet on an aspiring star for them to succeed in Korea.
Hybe, South Korea's largest entertainment company and the label behind big names like BTS, does not disclose how many trainees it has on board at any given point.
The industry average is estimated to be around 20. But Hybe did tell the Korea Herald newspaper in 2023 that nearly one in three of its trainees are foreign nationals.
SM Entertainment, another industry giant, has a dedicated academy for aspiring K-pop performers, and says the majority of its students come from overseas, but did not provide exact figures.
But the number of trainees enrolling is shrinking, according to an industry report published in January.
In 2024, agencies reported 963 trainees, about half of the number they had signed on in 2020: 1,895. Although the number of foreign trainees reported by agencies doubled to 42 between 2022 and 2024, they are still a fraction of the total figure.
It's a highly competitive selection process, and firms weigh up costs to make the decision.
Typically it takes about two years for a trainee to debut, and even then only 60% of them make it, according to the report. For foreign trainees, the barriers are even higher - language, visa restrictions and industry connections, all of which possibly worsen already slim odds.
And yet the allure of fame draws so many like Miyu to take their shot. Miyu and the other two trainees the BBC spoke to said their academy catered almost exclusively to foreign students and that there were no Korean students enrolled.
It's hard to know how many foreigners travel to South Korea to enrol in these training programmes because they can do this on a tourist visa that allows them to stay up to three months at a time.
Soon after she got there, Miyu claimed, reality collided with what she was promised. She said the standard of the dance and voice training was not what she expected, given the cost of the programme.
She said a senior staff member also began constantly monitoring her whereabouts. After about three months into the programme, he took her out, she claimed.
""He took me to a convenience store alone saying he would buy me ice cream. While I was choosing, he put his hand on my waist and said, 'good body"".
He called her on several occasions, according to Miyu. Once, he asked her to come to the office, saying they needed to discuss outfits for a photo shoot. ""He told me to sit on his lap to discuss costumes. I managed to sit on the armrest instead. From that day onwards, I get scared just hearing a man's voice.""
Another former foreign trainee Elin, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, also accused the same staff member of touching her inappropriately.
She said the staff member had called her into a meeting room and asked for them to be left alone. He then touched her waist while telling her the Korean word for ""hip"", saying he was teaching her Korean.
""I was so scared that I texted my friend and asked her to come quickly,"" Elin said.
She also alleged that the staff member would come into their dormitory room, an allegation repeated by Miyu and the third trainee the BBC interviewed.
""He would come… sometimes at two or three in the morning, saying he was fixing the lights. This one time he entered my room while I was asleep and just watched me,"" Elin said, adding she had woken up when she sensed someone entering the room.
He left the room without doing anything, but she said she ""couldn't sleep properly after that because I was so scared"".
When the BBC contacted the company for comment, their legal representative denied the claims, saying: ""Our company strictly prohibits anyone from entering the female trainees' dormitory without being accompanied by a female staff member, as set forth in our internal regulations.""
Elin also claimed that CCTV cameras recording both video and audio had been installed throughout the practice rooms and female dormitories - this allegation was also repeated by Miyu.
""The CCTV was live 24/7. They were picking up the audio as well... I didn't sign any consent to being filmed 24/7,"" said Elin, adding that the senior staff member ""would watch us while we were dancing and make comments through the CCTV"".
""At one point, he told the teacher, 'This isn't sexy enough — you need to teach the girls a sexier dance,"" she said.
The company, however, denied that the staff member entered the female dormitory, and said the cameras were installed only in common areas, such as entrances and kitchens, for ""safety reasons"", following past incidents involving intruders.
""The installation was announced in advance and intended entirely to safeguard the trainees,"" the legal representative told the BBC in a written response. Elin says she was never told of this.
Eventually, Elin dropped out of the programme and left Korea.
The three girls told the BBC that they didn't speak up immediately because they were worried that it could harm their chances in the K-pop industry. They said they also felt unable to tell their parents, who had paid large sums for them to train in Korea. And they faced other challenges, including the language barrier and an unfamiliar legal system.
Elin eventually went to the police and registered a case against the staff member, accusing him of sexual harassment and trespassing. But the police dropped the case, citing a lack of evidence. The staff member denied all the allegations. Her lawyers told the BBC that she was looking to appeal against the decision.
She has also registered a separate case against the company for breach of contract because of the alleged sexual harassment, trespassing in the dorms and CCTV surveillance.
Meanwhile, the company has continued recruiting students and still promotes its K-pop training programmes on social media. When Elin saw this, she was furious.
""K-pop has gained worldwide fame — and with that comes responsibility,"" she said. ""At the very least, I hope the children who chase this dream can do so in a safer environment.""
Miyu says she still dreams of becoming an idol.
""Whenever things were hard, I held on by listening to K-pop. I still want to become an idol, no matter what.""

Will Sunday's snap election gamble pay off for Japan's first female premier?,2026-02-06T23:05:00.267Z," Shaimaa Khalil
Tokyo correspondent
","Japan heads to the polls again on Sunday for its second general election in as many years. The snap vote has caught the ruling party, the opposition and much of the electorate off guard.
Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, is betting on her personal popularity, hoping to succeed where her party failed just last year: delivering a clear public mandate for the long-ruling but deeply unpopular Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
It is a political gamble - one her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, made, and lost badly. Voters will now decide whether it will pay off.
""The difference this time is that her approval across most media polls has been much, much higher than her predecessors,"" says Rintaro Nishimura, an analyst and senior associate at The Asia Group's Japan Practice.
""Conventional wisdom says: when approval is high, you call an election.""
Since taking office last October, Sanae Takaichi has dominated headlines, not through policy or legislation, but through political performance.
The ""work, work, work"" mantra in her acceptance speech reinforced the image of an energised, relentless leader.
In just over three months, she has cultivated a highly visible public profile. She's taken high-profile visits from world leaders, including receiving Donald Trump only a week into her premiership.
When they appeared aboard the USS George Washington in Yokosuka, the prime minister raised her fists in the air as President Trump lavished her with praise.
And just two days before February's vote, President Trump endorsed Takaichi saying she has ""already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader... one that truly loves her country"".
There was also her surprise appearance playing the song Golden from the film K-Pop Demon Hunters on the drums alongside South Korea's president, and the selfie with Italy's prime minister.
These were all viral moments projecting confidence and momentum, and distanced her from the traditionally stagnant and at times boring image of her predecessors.
""There is an atmosphere of positivity about her being the first female prime minister in Japanese history, about her being successful at diplomacy… with her having approval ratings in the 60s or sometimes as high as 70%,"" says Jeffrey Hall, lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies.
Professor Hall added that this image has been propped up by ""a large conservative group on the internet of users and social media influencers who provide a strong base for Takaichi, with posts showing her in a positive way going viral almost every day during the election"".
""So we have an atmosphere where users who log on to X [formerly Twitter]… the algorithm will be showing them very positive videos about Takaichi.""
Takaichi has also consolidated support among the LDP's conservative base, reviving long-dormant goals such as constitutional revision and emphasising traditional values.
""She's positioned herself as the leader who brings the LDP back to its [conservative] origins,"" Nishimura says. ""That has resonated internally among party elders as well as with the LDP base.""
Beyond the conservative base, Takaichi has connected with younger voters in a way not seen by a Japanese leader before. Her handbags and pink pens have become unlikely zeitgeist items.
""There's definitely an appeal among young people,"" Hall says.
""Young people tend to be the most disconnected from politics in Japan… but Takaichi has taken on this kind of idol-like, or celebrity-like, status among some young people.""
He points to media reports of sana-katsu - obsessive fan activity inspired by idol culture.
That personal appeal has translated into strong approval ratings which have hovered between the mid-fifties and high sixties, according to NHK and other major media polls.
Koichi Nakano, associate professor of political science at Sophia University, says that despite initial grumbling when the snap election was announced, the LDP appears to be riding high on the prime minister's popularity. A recent Asahi Shimbun survey suggests the party is on track to gain significantly more than the 233 seats needed for a majority in the 8 February lower house election.
""If the party does well,"" Nakano says, ""many MPs will feel grateful. Their scandals will be washed clean, and they'll become very obedient.""
A political funding corruption scandal that was revealed just over two years ago saw dozens of LDP lawmakers investigated over pocketing millions of dollars in proceeds from political fundraisers. It angered the public so much and cost party its majority in the 2024 election.
The timing of the election has drawn criticism from opposition parties. They argue the snap vote has delayed anti-inflation measures, postponed debate over the fiscal 2026 budget, and placed an additional administrative burden on local municipalities.
Hall says the primary motivation behind the timing was parliamentary arithmetic.
""The main purpose of calling the snap election when she did was to get back a parliamentary majority so that the new budget committee will be chaired by the LDP or a coalition partner,"" he says, allowing the budget to pass ""without opposition scrutiny"".
The vote also comes in the depths of winter. Parts of northern Japan have been hit by heavy snow, raising concerns that bad weather could affect turnout.
Last year's miscalculation also looms large over the ruling party. When Shigeru Ishiba called a snap election shortly after taking office, it backfired spectacularly, delivering one of the LDP's worst results in decades and costing the party its Lower House majority.
""When Ishiba called the election, the public was angry,"" Nakano says.
""There were financial scandals hanging over the LDP, and cost-of-living pressures were acute. This time, she has successfully distanced herself from that image.""
Still, Nakano calls the strategy high-risk. ""She's created popularity by dissociating herself from the party's stagnant image,"" he says.
""But elections are about parties, not just personalities. That's the danger.""
Since taking office, Takaichi has been on a diplomatic roll, but she has also managed to infuriate Japan's biggest trading partner, China.
Relations have deteriorated sharply after her comments suggesting Japan could respond militarily if China attacked Taiwan, remarks she has refused to retract.
The dispute escalated rapidly. Both sides lodged formal protests. Japan warned its citizens to stay safe in China, while Beijing urged its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan.
Domestically, the row has strengthened Takaichi's standing.
""She is a hawk… a conservative,"" says 85-year-old voter Naoaki Yuhara.
""Of course, the economy is an important issue for the people, but at my age -especially when I think about my grandchildren's generation - national defence is very important, and she is seriously thinking about it.""
But Takaichi's hawkishness on defence worries Haruka, a voter in her 30s.
""I am concerned about the defence issue. We don't know where exactly the money is being spent or how. I do worry that they may spend money on things like nuclear weapons or the use of military forces,"" she told the BBC.
""I worry that it may be happening behind our backs without our knowledge. Perhaps we're heading towards a future where we might have no choice but to engage in some sort of conflict.""
Rintaro Nishimura also warns that this hawkish stance could backfire in the long run. ""With a mandate, people expect her to be more hawkish on China. But prolonged tension could hurt the economy and that would hurt her approval.""
Koichi Nakano warns that public debate about the China spat has all but disappeared. ""There is a general taboo in the media… sensible discussions about how to coexist with China can get easily branded as appeasement,"" he says.
""The real economic and security consequences of burning bridges with China are not really being discussed.""
Sanae Takaichi is expected to visit Washington shortly after the elections to meet Donald Trump ahead of his summit with China's President Xi Jinping and amid Tokyo's very tense relationship with Beijing.
""Japan might get isolated without getting the support from Trump,"" Nakano warns, ""while it doesn't look anywhere near like a possibility that she'll be able to mend ties with Xi Jinping.""
While concern over financial scandals appears to have faded, cost-of-living pressures remain front of mind.
The sharp spike in rice prices in mid-2025 shocked households. Though it occurred before Takaichi took office, it continues to shape perceptions of the LDP.
Inflation slowed in late 2025, but wages remain stagnant and the yen has weakened further.
""I used to spend about 10,000 yen ($64; £47) a week on groceries,"" Kanako Himura says.
""Now it's always more. Prices are rising, quantities are shrinking. Even when the price stays the same, you get less.""
""Tokyo property prices are too high,"" says Kento Naka, a 35-year-old manga artist.
""Paper books cost about one-and-a-half times more now. Everything else too. But income hasn't caught up at all.""
Takaichi has promised public spending, inflation relief and tax cuts, but critics say the details remain vague.
""The reality is the cost of living is probably going to keep going up, and salaries are going to remain low… and that's one of the reasons why Takaichi is calling this early election,"" Hall said.
""She's probably figured out the economy is not going to be an easy fix. If she waits longer, people will start blaming her for the economy, as they blamed previous prime ministers.""
Other long-held priorities have also faded from her campaign, including weapons exports, an anti-espionage law and immigration reform. This tactic, observers say, is less about policy and more about keeping her high position in the polls.
Despite a newly formed centrist alliance between the Constitutional Democratic Party and former LDP coalition partner Komeito, polls suggest the opposition remains fragmented.
""The Komeito vote had been propping up the LDP for years,"" Jeffrey Hall says.
""Now the LDP is propping itself up using the popularity of the prime minister.""
Rintaro Nishimura says the election has been framed as a choice between certainty and the unknown. ""There's not a lot of precedent for an opposition-led government,"" he says. ""That's always in the back of voters' minds.""
The far-right Sanseito party has sharpened debate on immigration, but Jeffrey Hall says Takaichi's rise has blunted its momentum.
""One of the reasons the LDP picked Takaichi is that she is a hard-line conservative,"" he says. ""They were hoping she would draw nationalists back from Sanseito.""
But the prime minister faces a tough act balancing an ageing society reluctant to receive immigrants and an economy that would not sustain without them.
""Japan has a major labour shortage. Foreign workers are now vital to many sectors of the economy,"" he says. ""If she doesn't want the economy to get worse, she will continue increasing immigration.""
The dark cloud of the economy will hover over whoever takes office. If the prime minister does secure a majority, the stagnant wages, the weak yen and cost of living will be her most immediate and biggest challenges.
""There will be at least a brief honeymoon period,"" Koichi Nakano says. ""But the reality of the economy will hit very quickly.""

At least 18 die in 'rat-hole' mine blast in India,2026-02-06T04:55:16.504Z," Abhishek Dey
Guwahati
","At least 18 miners have died and one is severely injured after an explosion at an illegally-operated coal mine in India's northeastern state of Meghalaya, police say.
Rescue operations are on and some people are still feared trapped, police say, adding that the blast occurred around 11:00 local time (5:30 GMT) on Thursday in the East Jaintia Hills of the state.
Superintendent of the state police Vikash Kumar told reporters that the accident happened due to rat-hole mining - a hazardous method which involves the use of dynamite to break open narrow tunnels through which workers crouch to extract coal.
Rat-hole mining has continued in the state despite a blanket ban in place, activists say.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced financial assistance of 200,000 rupees ($2,215, £1,636) for the deceased and 50,000 rupees for the injured.
The blast - which happened inside the mine - was suspected to be caused by dynamite, police say.
The mine was located in a forested area 72km (45 miles) away from state capital Shillong.
Kumar says 18 bodies have been recovered so far and one person with severe burn injuries has been admitted to a hospital in Shillong. He, however, says it is not yet clear how many more workers might be trapped underground.
The police are yet to identify the people who owned and operated the mine, while a case has been registered against unidentified people, Kumar says. They are also yet to ascertain identities of the victims.
""Accountability will be fixed, and those responsible will face strict legal action,"" Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said in a statement.
Some locals, who say they had interacted with the miners recently, told reporters that most of those killed were from the neighbouring state of Assam.
Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said: ""If this is established, we will extend all possible assistance and support to the affected families from Assam.""
The blast is among the deadliest mining accidents in Meghalaya in recent years. In 2018, at least 15 miners were trapped after water from a nearby river filled a rat-hole mine, with rescue operations lasting months. While five miners escaped, bodies of two were later recovered - the rest were eventually assumed dead.
""Rat-hole mining, entailing digging holes about four to five feet in height, allowing an adult to squat and work, is highly risky,"" Agnes Kharshiing, a Meghalaya-based activist and campaigner against illegal mining, told reporters.
Activists say illegal coal mining has continued in parts of Meghalaya despite a blanket ban imposed by the country's National Green Tribunal in 2014, a restriction later upheld by India's Supreme Court. A monitoring committee appointed by a high court has repeatedly flagged enforcement failures in recent years.
Fatal accidents linked to illegal coal mining have been reported across several Indian states in recent years, including Gujarat, Jharkhand, Assam and West Bengal.
Officials and activists say high demand for coal, poverty in mining regions, weak enforcement in remote areas and alleged political patronage allow unsafe, unregulated mining to persist, often using rudimentary methods without safety equipment, leading to repeated loss of life.

Trump endorses Japan's Takaichi ahead of snap election,2026-02-06T03:25:51.007Z," Kelly NgandShaimaa Khalil
Tokyo correspondent
","Donald Trump has endorsed Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi ahead of a snap election in her country on Sunday.
Takaichi has ""already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader... one that truly loves her country,"" the US president wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday, adding: ""She will not let the people of Japan down!""
While it is rare for US presidents to publicly back candidates in foreign elections, Trump has done so before, endorsing Argentina's Javier Milei and Hungary's Viktor Orban most recently.
Takaichi has courted the US president as Tokyo seeks more stability in its relationship with Washington, its closest ally, in the wake of Trump's tariffs.
Trump had threatened a 25% tariff initially, but Japan then struck a deal in July to invest $550bn (£407bn) in the US. In exchange, Washington lowered import levies to 15%.
Takaichi, 64, became PM in October after she won the leadership race in her party and secured enough support in parliament. But she has called an election to seek a public mandate.
Just one week after she took office, Tokyo rolled out the red carpet for Trump, deploying a full military guard of honour and band to welcome him at the Akasaka Palace, the government's state guesthouse.
It was her diplomatic debut, and the optics were striking: Takaichi aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, fists pumping as the US president praised her in front of thousands of US soldiers, the images then broadcast around the world.
She sought to portray herself as a leader Trump can and wants to do business with and, perhaps more importantly for the president, someone he gets along with personally.
The two leaders also see eye-to-eye on defence. Trump wants Tokyo to spend more on its own security and so does Takaichi, as sentiment grows in Japan that it must invest more in defence.
They heaped compliments on each other during the visit and signed a deal on rare earths, as well as a document heralding a new ""golden age"" of US-Japan relations. Takaichi described Trump as a ""partner in a new golden era"", and praised his role in bringing peace to the Middle East.
""In my visit to Japan, I and all of my representatives, were extremely impressed with her,"" Trump wrote in his Truth Social post on Thursday, noting that the two countries have made progress in national security cooperation and on the economic front.
Trump also said he would welcome Takaichi to the White House on 19 March.

His post, which signals that Takaichi is a leader his administration would work with, is a message aimed not only at Japanese voters but also the region, and especially China.
Beijing and Tokyo are in the middle of a diplomatic rift, and the historically tense relationship has hit its lowest point in more than a decade.
Takaichi found herself the target of China's ire in November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan, the self-governed island it has long claimed. She has since refused to retract the statement.
Trump's endorsement of her comes as tensions between them continue, and a day after he had a phone call with China's leader Xi Jinping.
He said he had an ""extremely good"" relationship with China, and that both he and Xi ""realise how important it is to keep it that way"".
Xi called Taiwan ""the most important issue"" in their relationship, emphasising that Taiwan was ""China's territory"", Chinese state media reported. He also told Trump that Washington should be ""prudent"" when supplying weapons to the self-governed island which China has long claimed.
Polls so far are predicting a landslide for Takaichi but winning Sunday's election will just be the first of several hurdles.
Her leadership will be defined by how she manages Japan's stagnant economy and the delicate relationship with the US, its most critical security ally, as well as China, its largest trading partner.

"We had sex in a Chinese hotel, then found we had been broadcast to thousands",2026-02-06T00:15:23.782Z," Wanqing Zhang
BBC Global China Unit and Eye Investigations
","One night in 2023, Eric was scrolling on a social media channel he regularly browsed for porn. Seconds into a video, he froze.
He realised the couple he was watching - entering the room, setting down their bags, and later, having sex - was himself and his girlfriend. Three weeks earlier, they had spent the night in a hotel in Shenzhen, southern China, unaware that they were not alone.
Their most intimate moments had been captured by a camera hidden in their hotel room, and the footage made available to thousands of strangers who had logged in to the channel Eric himself used to access pornography.
Eric (not his real name) was no longer just a consumer of China's spy-cam porn industry, but a victim.
Warning: This story contains some offensive language
So-called spy-cam porn has existed in China for at least a decade, despite the fact that producing and distributing porn is illegal in the country.
But in the past couple of years the issue has become a regular talking point on social media, with people - particularly women - swapping tips on how to spot cameras as small as a pencil eraser. Some have even resorted to pitching tents inside hotel rooms to avoid being filmed.
Last April, new government regulations attempted to stem this epidemic - requiring hotel owners to check regularly for hidden cameras.
But the threat of being secretly filmed in the privacy of a hotel room has not gone away. The BBC World Service has found thousands of recent spy-cam videos filmed in hotel rooms and sold as porn, on multiple sites.
Outside the UK, watch the film on YouTube or listen to the Podcast here
Much of the material is advertised on the messaging and social media app Telegram. Over 18 months, I discovered six different websites and apps promoted on Telegram. Between them these claimed to operate more than 180 hotel-room spy-cams which were not just capturing, but livestreaming, hotel guests' activities.
I monitored one of these websites regularly for seven months and found content captured by 54 different cameras, with about half operational at any one time.
That means thousands of guests could have been filmed over that period, the BBC estimates, based on typical occupancy rates. Most are unlikely to know they have been captured on camera.
Eric, from Hong Kong, began watching secretly filmed videos as a teenager, attracted by how ""raw"" the footage was.
""What drew me in is the fact that the people don't know they're being filmed,"" says Eric, now in his 30s. ""I think traditional porn feels very staged, very fake.""
But he experienced what it feels like to be at the opposite end of the supply chain when he found the video of himself and his girlfriend ""Emily"" - and he no longer finds gratification in this content.
When he broke the news to Emily that their hotel stay had been filmed, edited into an hour-long clip, and uploaded to Telegram, she thought he was joking. But then she saw the footage for herself and was mortified.
Emily was terrified the clip could have been seen by colleagues and family. The couple didn't talk to each other for weeks.
So how does the industry - which exploits unsuspecting couples' intimate sexual acts for voyeuristic paying customers - work, and who is behind it?
One of the most prominent spy-cam porn traders I came across was an agent known as ""AKA"".
Posing as a consumer, I paid to access one of the livestreaming websites promoted by him - for a monthly fee of 450 Yuan ($65, £47).
Once logged in, I had the option to choose between five different filming feeds, each showing several hotel rooms - visible as soon as a guest triggered the electricity supply by inserting their key card. It was also possible to rewind livestreams from the start, and download archived clips.
On Telegram - banned in China but commonly used for illicit activity - AKA advertised these livestreams. One Telegram channel had as many as 10,000 members during the course of our investigation.
Libraries of his edited livestream clips are also available on Telegram for a flat fee. I could see more than 6,000 videos in the archive, dating back to 2017.
AKA's subscribers comment in Telegram's channel function, as they watch unsuspecting hotel guests - judging their appearance, gossiping about their conversations, and appraising their sexual performance.
They celebrate when a couple starts having sex - and complain if they switch the lights off, shrouding them in darkness. Women are regularly described as ""sluts"", ""whores"" and ""bitches"".
We managed to trace one of the spy-cams to a hotel room in Zhengzhou, central China, through piecing together several clues, from subscribers, social media users, and our own research.
Researchers on the ground were able to access the room, and found the camera - lens pointed at the bed - hidden in the wall ventilation unit and wired into the building's electricity supply.
A hidden-camera detector, widely sold online as a ""must-have"" for hotel guests, gave no warning they were being spied on.
The team disabled the secret camera and word spread quickly on Telegram.
""Zhonghua [name of the camera] got taken down!"" one subscriber wrote on the main channel managed by AKA.
""It's such a shame; that room has the best sound quality!"" AKA responded in the chat.
But the complaints turned to celebration when, within hours, AKA posted that a replacement camera in a different hotel had been activated.
""This is the speed of… [our livestreaming platform],"" AKA told his subscribers. ""Impressive right?""
During our 18-month investigation we identified about a dozen agents like AKA.
The exchanges they had with subscribers made it clear they were working for others higher up the supply chain, who they referred to as ""camera owners"". These people, the agents' comments suggested, arranged the spy-cam installation and managed the livestreaming platforms.
During our direct messaging with AKA, he accidentally shared a screenshot of a message from someone he said was a ""camera owner"", with the profile name ""Brother Chun"".
AKA quickly deleted the message, and refused to discuss it, but we managed to contact ""Brother Chun"" directly. Despite our evidence that he supplied the livestreaming website to AKA, Brother Chun claimed he was just another sales agent, although he did seem to acknowledge the supply chain extended beyond people like himself.
What is clear is there are significant sums of money to be made. Based on channel membership and subscription fees, the BBC estimates AKA alone has earned at least 163,200 Yuan ($22,000, £16,300) since last April. The average annual income in China last year was 43,377 Yuan ($6,200, £4,600) according to China's Bureau of Statistics.
There are strict rules on selling and using spy-cams in China, but we found it relatively easy to buy one in the country's largest electronics market in Huaqiangbei.
Accurate figures on how many people have been brought before the courts for spy-cam porn are more difficult to find. China's authorities have shared far fewer legal case details in recent years, but the cases we found ranged the length of China - from Jilin province in the north, to Guangdong in the far south.
Blue Li, from a Hong Kong-based NGO called RainLily - which helps victims remove explicit secretly-filmed footage from the internet - says demand is rising for her group's services, but the task is proving more difficult.
Telegram never responds to RainLily's requests for removal, she says, forcing them to contact group administrators - the very people selling or sharing spy-cam pornography - who have little incentive to respond.
""We believe tech companies share the huge responsibility in addressing these problems. Because these companies are not neutral platforms; their policies shape how the content would be spread,"" Li says.
The BBC itself told Telegram, via its report function, that AKA and Brother Chun - and the groups they managed - were sharing spy-cam porn via its platforms, but it did not respond or take any action.
Contacted again 10 days later, with the BBC's full investigation findings, Telegram told us: ""Sharing non-consensual pornography is explicitly forbidden by Telegram's terms of service"" and ""it proactively moderates… and accepts reports [of inappropriate content] in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.""
We formally set out our findings to Brother Chun and AKA that they were profiting from exploiting unsuspecting hotel guests. They did not reply, but hours later the Telegram accounts they used to advertise the content appeared to have been deleted. However the website that AKA sold me access to is still livestreaming hotel guests.
Eric and Emily remain traumatised by their experience. They always wear hats in public in case they are recognised and try to avoid staying in hotels. Eric no longer uses these Telegram channels to watch porn, he says, but still checks them occasionally - terrified the clip could resurface.

Meet the women protecting India's snow leopards,2026-02-06T00:15:18.835Z," Ashay Yedge
BBC Marathi
","In one of India's coldest and most remote regions, a group of women have taken on an unlikely role: protecting one of Asia's most elusive predators, the snow leopard.
Snow leopards are found in just 12 countries across Central and South Asia. India is home to one of the world's largest populations, with a nationwide survey in 2023 - the first comprehensive count ever carried out in the country - estimating more than 700 animals, .
One of the places they roam is around Kibber village in Himachal Pradesh state's Spiti Valley, a stark, high-altitude cold desert along the Himalayan belt. Here, snow leopards are often called the ""ghosts of the mountains"", slipping silently across rocky slopes and rarely revealing themselves.
For generations, the animals were seen largely as a threat, for attacking livestock. But attitudes in Kibber and neighbouring villages are beginning to shift, as people increasingly recognise the snow leopard's role as a top predator in the food chain and its importance in maintaining the region's fragile mountain ecosystem.
Nearly a dozen local women are now working alongside the Himachal Pradesh forest department and conservationists to track and protect the species, playing a growing role in conservation efforts.
Locally, the snow leopard is known as Shen and the women call their group ""Shenmo"". Trained to install and monitor camera traps, they handle devices fitted with unique IDs and memory cards that automatically photograph snow leopards as they pass.
""Earlier, men used to go and install the cameras and we kept wondering why couldn't we do it too,"" says Lobzang Yangchen, a local coordinator working with a small group supported by the non-profit Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) in collaboration with the forest department.
Yangchen was among the women who helped collect data for Himachal Pradesh's snow leopard survey in 2024, which found that the state was home to 83 snow leopards - up from 51 in 2021.
The survey documented snow leopards and 43 other species using camera traps spread across an area of nearly 26,000sq km (10,000sq miles). Individual leopards were identified by the unique rosette patterns on their fur, a standard technique used for spotted big cats. The findings are now feeding into wider conservation and habitat-management plans.
""Their contribution was critical to identifying individual animals,"" says Goldy Chhabra, deputy conservator of forests with the Spiti Wildlife Division.
Collecting the data is demanding work. Most of it takes place in winter, when heavy snowfall pushes snow leopards and their prey to lower altitudes, making their routes easier to track.
On survey days, the women wake up early, finish household chores and gather at a base camp before travelling by vehicle as far as the terrain allows. From there, they trek several kilometres to reach camera sites, often at altitudes above 14,000ft (4,300m), where the thin air makes even simple movement exhausting.
The BBC accompanied the group on one such trek in December. After hours of walking in biting cold, the women suddenly stopped on a narrow trail.
Yangchen points to pugmarks in the dust: ""This shows the snow leopard has been here recently. These pugmarks are fresh.""
Along with pugmarks, the team looks for other signs, including scrapes and scent‑marking spots, before carefully fixing a camera to a rock along the trail.
One woman then carries out a ""walk test"", crawling along the path to check whether the camera's height and angle will capture a clear image.
The group then moves on to older sites, retrieving memory cards and replacing batteries installed weeks earlier.
By mid-afternoon, they return to camp to log and analyse the images using specialised software - tools many had never encountered before.
""I studied only until grade five,"" says Chhering Lanzom. ""At first, I was scared to use the computer. But slowly, we learned how to use the keyboard and mouse.""
The women joined the camera-trapping programme in 2023. Initially, conservation was not their motivation. But winters in the Spiti Valley are long and quiet, with little agricultural work to fall back on.
""At first, this work on snow leopards didn't interest us,"" Lobzang says. ""We joined because we were curious and we could earn a small income.""
The women earn between 500 ($5.46; £4) and 700 rupees a day.
But beyond the money, the work has helped transform how the community views the animal.
""Earlier, we thought the snow leopard was our enemy,"" says Dolma Zangmo, a local resident. ""Now we think their conservation is important.""
Alongside survey work, the women help villagers access government insurance schemes for their livestock and promote the use of predator‑proof corrals - stone or mesh enclosures that protect animals at night.
Their efforts come at a time of growing recognition for the region. Spiti Valley has recently been included in the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve, a Unesco-recognised network aimed at conserving fragile ecosystems while supporting local livelihoods.
As climate change reshapes the fragile trans-Himalayan landscape, conservationists say such community participation will be crucial to safeguarding species like the snow leopard.
""Once communities are involved, conservation becomes more sustainable,"" says Deepshikha Sharma, programme manager with NCF's High Altitudes initiative.
""These women are not just assisting, they are becoming practitioners of wildlife conservation and monitoring,"" she adds.
As for the women, their work makes them feel closer to their home, the village and the mountains that raised them, they say.
""We were born here, this is all we know,"" Lobzang says. ""Sometimes we feel afraid because these snow leopards are after all predatory animals, but this is where we belong.""

"For Thailand's popular progressives, winning the vote is only the first hurdle",2026-02-05T23:36:16.648Z," Jonathan Head
South East Asia correspondent
Bangkok
","Suttasitt ""Macky"" Pottasak is a typical candidate of Thailand's People's Party: young, idealistic and hardworking.
He gave up a career in TV drama production in Bangkok to run in the last election, winning a rural seat near his home city of Nakhon Ratchasima from an old, established political family. He has adopted the hat and flag of Luffy, the main character in the Japanese anime series One Piece, which has featured in recent youth protests in Asia. He makes light-hearted videos about his party's policies every day, which are getting millions of views on social media.
""Politics is something past generations made boring. I want to make it fun,"" he says. ""That's why I brought in Luffy and my video mini-series. We don't have money to buy votes. We are just ordinary citizens, but with a strong determination to solve the long-standing problems. I think the villagers can see that.""
Opinion polls suggest that much of the Thai public agrees with the People's Party. They are polling consistently ahead of their rivals as the election on Sunday draws near.
But in Thailand, winning an election is never enough.
The last one, less than three years ago, produced a surprise win for the progressive Move Forward party, which had campaigned on promises of root-and-branch political and economic reforms. These included making Thailand's powerful military, and its largest businesses, more accountable, and reducing the heavy punishments under the notorious lese majeste law.
But powerful conservative forces, in particular the unelected senate and the constitutional court, blocked Move Forward from forming a government, dissolved the party and banned its leaders from politics. The court ruled that its proposals for the lese majeste law amounted to an attempt to overthrow the entire political system.
Now, after three tumultuous years of short-lived coalition administrations, the sacking of two prime ministers by the constitutional court and a border war with Cambodia, the reformists are making another bid for power, this time under a new name, the People's Party.
Their youthful energy and idealism still draw large and excited crowds. At a rally in Nakhon Ratchasima the new party leader, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, a 38-year-old former software engineer, was mobbed like a rock star, people queueing for selfies with him and wrapping him in garlands of flowers.
Macky and two assistants tour his constituency on e-scooters, passing irrigation canals, rice fields and the simple wooden houses characteristic of north-eastern Thai villages, listening to the concerns of the residents. They tell a story of a society under acute economic stress, where the old engines of growth have stopped working.
The village head La-or Kohsantea says there are few decent jobs in the area, so young people have to leave to find work. ""No-one has helped us with the problem of poverty,"" she says. Thailand has one of the highest levels of household debt in Asia. GDP is growing at less than 2% a year, far lower than neighbouring countries.
Kritsana Lohsantea, 28, is asking Macky to help him get a modest social security payment when the electronics factory he works at closes down later this year.
Like many young Thais in rural areas he left school at 15 with few qualifications, but the low-skilled manufacturing jobs which helped Thailand grow rapidly 30 or 40 years ago are now moving to lower-cost locations like Vietnam.
Macky has also noticed how many elderly people there are in the area. Thailand's population has been falling for five years. Last year the number of births fell 10 %, the highest rate in the world.
With so many young people leaving the village, Macky is proposing local training and a better online system for organising care-givers, to look after house-bound old people who no longer have family members living with them.
The People's Party stands out for its ambition to transform Thailand.
It has prioritised amending the constitution, which was drafted under military rule and gives a lot of power to unelected agencies like the constitutional court to constrain elected governments. The party wants to streamline the country's extensive bureaucracy, modernise its education system, and curb the power of the military and the biggest businesses. It also supports amending the military-drafted constitution, a question which will be put in a referendum at the same time as the election.
Its two main rivals, Bhumjaithai, the party of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, and Pheu Thai, the party of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, have focused instead on more crowd-pleasing policies.
Anutin has highlighted his nationalist credentials, pointing to the hard line he took against Cambodia in the border war, and his support for the military.
""I promise you I will protect our soil with my life,"" he told the crowd at a rally in Bangkok. ""If you want a prime minister the enemy cannot intimidate, choose my party.""
He has also persuaded many MPs from other parties to defect to him, and recruited technocrats known for their competence, to build Bhumjaithai up into a leading conservative political force.
Pheu Thai, which built its past popularity on eye-catching populist policies has promised to create nine new millionaires – in Thai baht – every day through a national prize draw. Both parties are offering subsidies and cash handouts, but many economists argue this kind of instant help does little so solve the deep structural problems confronting Thailand.
""This is barking up the wrong tree,"" says Apichat Satitniramai, a professor of economics at Thammasat University. ""These stimulus packages are like painkillers, which are less effective the more we use them.""
In his view the People's Party is the only one thinking long-term, rather than just about what is needed to win the election.
From the moment the People's Party was founded in 2017, then called Future Forward, by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a charismatic and wealthy entrepreneur, it was viewed as a threat by powerful conservative figures.
Thailand was under military rule at the time. The then-army chief compared the party to the armed communist insurgency of the Cold War. Some feared Thanathorn's argument that everything in Thailand needed reforming, might eventually include the monarchy, which conservatives say must be untouchable.
After the party's surprisingly strong performance in the 2019 election, the constitutional court, which had already disqualified other parties and politicians seen as a threat to the status quo, barred Thanathorn from political office for 10 years. This was over his ownership of shares in a small publishing company, which was judged to violate rules against politicians controlling news media.
Future Forward was dissolved by the court the following year, a verdict which ignited large-scale student protests that lasted until the end of the year, and for the first time, called for reform of the monarchy.
By the time of the next election in 2023 the public hunger for change was even greater, delivering the successor party, Move Forward, its unexpected win, followed by the almost inevitable dissolution.
So, all eyes are on what happens after voting this weekend. If, as the polls suggest, the People's Party gets even more seats than last time, it will be well ahead of its closest rival, though the polls show none of the parties getting an overall majority of the 500 seats in parliament. This time the senate is no longer allowed to take part in choosing the next government.
Yet everyone in Thailand expects some kind of move to block the People's Party once again. A case has been filed against 44 of its leading figures - including 15 of their parliamentary candidates - with the National Anti-Corruption Commission, over their personal endorsement of the lese majeste proposals.
That could be used to bar them all from politics. Two of their candidates are also facing jail time under that law.
""They are afraid of us,"" Thanathorn told the BBC, as he prepared to join a People's Party campaign bus. ""They are afraid of change. They want tomorrow to be just like yesterday. They think dissolving our parties, banning our leaders from politics, would make us smaller.
""In fact, we are getting bigger.""
Even if his party is allowed to join a government, the constraints on what they can do in office remain in place. That is why they have made reforming the constitution such a high priority, to dilute or end the extraordinary powers that deeply conservative institutions like the constitutional court have to unseat elected governments.
In that they are joined by rival party Pheu Thai, which saw two of its prime ministers removed from office by the court during their two years in power. But there are many hurdles to getting a new charter. The process could take years, or it could easily be blocked.
""If Thailand was a functional democracy, none of this would have happened,"" says Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University.
""We have regular elections, sometimes punctuated by military coups. But elections only determine the representatives in the lower house of parliament. They do not determine who governs. That is determined by elite networks, and unelected institutions which have played a veto role against the will of the voters.""

Japanese city cancels cherry blossom festival over badly behaved tourists,2026-02-05T13:07:45.295Z," Malu Cursino
","Japanese authorities in a town near Mount Fuji have cancelled this year's cherry blossom festival, saying a surge in tourist numbers is unmanageable for locals.
The influx of tourists to the town of Fujiyoshida has led to chronic traffic congestion and litter, while some residents say they've experienced tourists trespassing or defecating in private gardens.
The area is a popular destination during spring because Japan's world-renowned cherry trees are in full bloom, and can be admired with Mount Fuji in the background.
But Fujiyoshida's picturesque scenery threatens ""the quiet lives of citizens,"" the city's mayor explained, adding: ""We have a strong sense of crisis.""
""To protect the dignity and living environment of our citizens, we have decided to bring the curtain down on the 10-year-old festival,"" Fujiyoshida mayor Shigeru Horiuchi said when making the announcement on Tuesday.
In April 2016, authorities announced they would be opening the gates of Arakurayama Sengen Park to host tourists during the sakura (cherry blossom) season.
The park offers a panoramic view of the city from its pagoda, with several picture-worthy and ""Instagrammable"" spots.
Fujiyoshida authorities began hosting the annual event at Arakurayama Sengen Park with the hope to enhance the area's appeal and increase the numbers of visitors by creating ""a lively atmosphere in the area"".
However, authorities say the number of visitors in recent years has ""increased dramatically, exceeding the city's capacity and resulting in overtourism, which is having a serious impact on the living environment of local residents"".
Now, as many as 10,000 visitors flock to the town daily during the peak blossom season, Fujiyoshida authorities add in a statement.
This increase is ""due to factors such as the weak yen and explosive popularity fueled by social media"".
The town's authorities report that tourists were ""opening private home doors without permission to use the restroom,"" trespassing, littering and ""defecating in private yards and raising a fuss when residents pointed this out"".
Although the festival will not go ahead, the city is preparing for an increased number of visitors during April and May.
It is not the first time Japanese authorities have had to take measures to address photo-keen tourists.
In 2024, officials blocked one of Japan's most iconic photo spots in Fujikawaguchiko with a big black barrier in a bid to deter badly behaved tourists.
Residents of Fujikawaguchiko had accused foreign tourists of littering and parking illegally as they searched for the perfect picture.
Japan is not alone in its efforts to deter overcrowding caused by tourists.
On Monday, Italian authorities introduced a €2 fee to access the viewing area of Rome's iconic Trevi Fountain, which had previously been free to visit. Authorities say the fee will go towards helping to manage the number of tourists, and raise funds for the monument's upkeep.
In Venice, day trippers hoping to visit the Italian city on certain days between April and July will have to pay €5 if they book in advance, or €10 if they book last-minute.

Political row erupts in India over ex-army chief's unpublished memoir,2026-02-05T03:23:38.784Z," Nikita Yadav
Delhi
","India's opposition leader Rahul Gandhi caused uproar in parliament when he tried to quote passages from a former army chief's unpublished memoir, in which the country's top political leaders are accused of failing to give clear directions during the 2020 military standoff with China.
The allegation is made in General MM Naravane's unpublished book Four Stars of Destiny, which has been awaiting government clearance since 2024.
Twenty Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops were killed in the 2020 border brawl.
The claims have sparked a political row, bringing parliament to a standstill. Gandhi was repeatedly interrupted as he tried to read excerpts from the book in a debate on Monday.
He later said the memoir claimed that as Chinese tanks advanced at Indian positions, Naravane was told ""to do what he deemed appropriate"".
India and China clashed along their disputed Himalayan border in the summer of 2020 in the Galwan river valley in Ladakh, marking their first fatal confrontation since 1975.
Tensions eased in 2024 after years of military and diplomatic negotiations, with both sides agreeing to disengage in affected border areas.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP party accused Gandhi of insulting Indian soldiers and breaking parliamentary rules by trying to read from an unpublished book. Naravane is yet to comment on the furore.
His memoir has been making headlines in India since the weekend after The Caravan magazine published an essay containing passages that it said were excerpts from the unreleased manuscript.
The BBC has not seen the manuscript and cannot independently verify the excerpts. It has contacted Naravane and his publisher, Penguin Random House, for comment.
On Monday, Gandhi tried to read passages from a photocopy of the article during a discussion in the lower house of parliament.
""This is about when four Chinese tanks were entering Indian territory,"" he said, before he was stopped from speaking further.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said he told leaders from the Congress party that Gandhi could continue his speech. ""However, what the former army chief did not say, what is not true, and what is not permitted under the rules should not be forced upon the house,"" he added.
This wasn't the first time the Congress leader had criticised the government over China.
He has repeatedly accused the Modi government of ""giving away"" Indian territory to China during the 2020 standoff. The government has strongly rejected the allegations, insisting no land was lost.
In parliament on Monday, Gandhi's comments about Naravane's memoir were interrupted by members of the BJP, including Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah, who accused him of violating parliamentary rules by quoting from an unpublished book and misleading the house.
The defence minister said ""Rahul Gandhi should present before the house the book he is quoting from, because the book he is referring to has not been published"".
Gandhi insisted that his source was ""authentic"" and that he was entitled to quote from it. The noisy exchanges between the governing and opposition benches led to proceedings being adjourned for the day on Monday.
But disruptions continued on Tuesday, when Gandhi attempted to raise the issue again in the house. He was stopped again, sparking fresh protests from opposition leaders. Eight Congress MPs were later suspended for disorderly conduct.
On Wednesday, Gandhi held up a copy of the unpublished book to reporters outside parliament, saying Singh's statement that the book did not exist was untrue.
He quoted from the book to say that ""the standing order was not to fire upon Chinese troops if they entered Indian territory without asking the top leadership"".
When the former army chief repeatedly called Rajnath Singh, he relayed a message from Modi effectively leaving the decision to Naravane, he said.
""I felt really alone. I was abandoned by the entire establishment,"" Gandhi quoted Naravane as saying. He added that this showed ""that PM Modi had abdicated responsibility during the Ladakh crisis"".
Naravane served as India's army chief from 2019 to 2022.
His memoir, which reportedly covers his personal life and career, was expected to be published in 2024 but has been delayed amid reports that it contains sensitive operational details of the military standoff.
The reasons for the delay have not been officially disclosed by the publisher. But in April last year, Narvane told a Hindi YouTube channel that discussions were under way between Penguin Random House and the defence ministry to secure the required clearances.
""My job was to write the book and give it to the publisher, now it is their job to take it forward,"" he said.
Under existing rules, retired intelligence and security officials are barred from publishing material that could affect India's ""sovereignty and integrity"" and need clearance from their former organisations before doing so.
Speaking to India Today channel earlier this week, retired army general KJS Dhillon said that any serving or retired officer wishing to publish a book containing operational details must submit the manuscript to army headquarters for approval.
After that, he said, there could be three possible outcomes: approval if no sensitive information is found; consultations with the author if concerns are raised; or rejection if the material is deemed to risk national security or operational plans.
Naravane is not the first retired army officer to write about India's military confrontations with its neighbours.
In 2006, former army chief Gen VP Malik published an account of India's 1999 war with Pakistan. Dhillon has also written about his tenure as the top military commander in Indian-administered Kashmir, as well as a separate book on India's 2025 military tensions with Pakistan.

Gen Z toppled an autocrat - but old guard tipped to win Bangladesh vote,2026-02-05T00:35:15.933Z," Azadeh Moshiri
South Asia Correspondent
in Dhaka
","Rahat Hossain was almost killed trying to save his friend in a youth uprising that became one of the bloodiest episodes in Bangladesh's history.
Footage of him trying to pull Emam Hasan Taim Bhuiyan, who'd been shot by police, to safety went viral during a revolution that toppled the country's leader.
During a crackdown on protests on 20 July 2024, Hossain, 24, and Bhuiyan, 19, took shelter at a Dhaka tea stall but police dragged them out, beat them and ordered them to run.
Bhuiyan was shot. Seeing him sprawled on the ground, Hossain began dragging him away, but police kept shooting. Hossain felt a bullet strike his own leg.
""I had to leave him behind,"" Hossain says. Bhuiyan was later declared dead in hospital.
Violence like this became the catalyst that turned student-led demonstrations into a mass protest nationwide, with its epicentre in the capital, Dhaka. Within a fortnight, the government had been swept from power, with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fleeing the country.
Up to 1,400 people died during the protests, the vast majority killed in the security crackdown ordered by Hasina, according to the United Nations.
Hasina's downfall seemed to promise a new age. The uprising was considered the first and most successful of a series of Gen Z protests around the world.
Some student leaders in Bangladesh went on to hold key posts in an interim government, trying to shape the kind of country they had taken to the streets to fight for. They were expected to play a role in the country's future administration, after decades of rule by Hasina's Awami League and the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
But as general elections loom next week, the students' newly formed political party is badly fractured and women in the movement largely sidelined. With the Awami League banned, other long-established parties are filling the vacuum.
Hossain joined the 2024 student-led demonstrations - which brought together young men and women, secular and religious - initially to protest against new quotas in civil service jobs, but kept going as they morphed into ""a single shared objective"" to end ""autocratic rule"".
However, the interim government has failed to produce the ""beautiful Bangladesh based on peace, equality, justice and fairness"" he had hoped for, he told the BBC.
He isn't alone in feeling the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) is too inexperienced. Instead, he's impressed by another, much older party: Jamaat-e-Islami.
It's an Islamist party which has served as a minor coalition partner, but gained momentum of its own in the run-up to the 12 February election, from which the Awami League is banned.
Established in 1941, Jamaat has always been dogged by its stance during Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed, and more than 10 million fled their homes. Some of Jamaat's politicians were accused of collaborating with then West Pakistan.
But that history does not seem to bother Hossain, who believes Jamaat has modernised.
""Jamaat supported the comrades of the July uprising and the students in various ways,"" he explains.
Jamaat's leader Shafiqur Rahman told the BBC the party is pledging to end corruption and restore the judiciary's independence - claims that will be hard to deliver in a country with historically high levels of corruption, but which have resonated with many.
Professor Tawfique Haque of North South University in Dhaka says most younger voters, born long after 1971, can separate Jamaat from its history and don't see it as a red line.
""It's a generational issue,"" he says, arguing they don't want to be ""bogged down with this debate"".
Instead, younger voters have seen the party as a fellow victim of Hasina's rule, according to Haque, banned from politics and many of its politicians in jail.
Hossain is not the only one turning to Jamaat: candidates backed by the party's student wing won a landslide during student elections at Bangladesh's top universities last September, in a vote seen as a bellwether of the national mood.
Notably, it was the first time since independence that an Islamist party had won control of the student union at Bangladesh's prestigious Dhaka University.
It was also the first major sign of trouble for the student leaders, in a country where about four in 10 voters are under 37.
The lack of faith in the NCP is a major blow to the student leaders.
""We were hoping to do a lot better,"" admits Asif Mahmud, 27, a former adviser to the interim government, and now chairman of the NCP's Election Committee.
But, he argues, the odds were stacked against them: ""Only two parties have led Bangladesh for the last 50 years… we are trying to prove ourselves.""
So the NCP made a choice. In December, they announced a multi-party alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami.
Like Jamaat, the NCP has promised to root out corruption. Its manifesto has other pledges aimed at younger voters: justice for families of those killed in the uprising, lowering the voting age to 16, and job creation through tax and economic reform.
Mahmud argues the NCP needed help from Jamaat's grassroots operation, even if they disagree on certain issues. ""We have always said we are not an Islamist party,"" he said, ""This is not an ideological alliance.""
But of the 30 candidates Jamaat is allowing the NCP to field, only two are women. Jamaat is fielding more than 200 candidates, all of them men.
That's a compromise senior female members of the NCP like Tasnim Jara have called a ""moral red line"", and why she and several others have resigned from the party.
""They wanted to sideline us,"" says Shima Akhter, a 25-year-old student who helped lead the protests.
Despite women playing a leading role in the uprising, Shima argues the interim government under Muhammad Yunus is still mostly dominated by men.
""Where are the women?""
After the uprising, Shima and other women activists were targeted in social media posts.
""Some meme videos were so violent and so frustrating,"" she recalls. ""We were slut shamed, trolled.""
Videos began circulating of them, belittling their intelligence, claiming their marriage prospects were destroyed, and some even attacked Shima for the colour of her skin.
Both parties deny sidelining women, instead claiming the numbers of women standing is a result of Bangladesh's ""social structure"". Jamaat's Shafiqur Rahman added that he hoped that would change.
Shima dismisses that as ""just a patriarchal excuse"".
She is leaning towards the BNP, which is fielding 10 women out of more than 250 candidates. ""Better than bad,"" she says.
The NCP's lack of support, together with the ban on the Awami League, is also benefiting the BNP, which has rebranded itself as a liberal democratic force.
After seeing thousands of supporters and senior members jailed under Awami rule, the BNP is now the largest party contending - and is further squeezing the student party.
Like the Awami League – whose leader Hasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, considered the country's founder - the BNP is tied to a political dynasty.
Its new leader Tarique Rahman is the son of the late Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's first female prime minister. Zia herself came to power after her husband, a former president, was assassinated in a military coup.
""Whether you come from a dynasty or not is irrelevant,"" former BNP commerce minister, now candidate, Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury told the BBC.
Ironically, this dynastic cycle enduring is only possible thanks to the student-led uprising, following which Rahman was able to return after 17 years in self-imposed exile. Hasina's exit allowed both him and his mother to be acquitted of corruption charges they maintained were politically motivated.
He has criticised Jamaat for using religious sentiment to win votes, and is promising economic and democratic reforms, as well as a ""rainbow nation"", where a new ""National Reconciliation Commission"" would help the country move past its divisions.
Hasina governed Bangladesh for 15 years, overseeing economic progress, but increasingly attempting to silence opposition, with politically-motivated arrests, disappearances and extra-judicial killings. She was sentenced to death for the crackdown in 2024 by Bangladesh's war crimes tribunal last year.
From exile, she has denounced the ban on her party. Many other senior Awami leaders are also sheltering in India with her. Some are under arrest back home.
The BBC spoke to a district leader for the party in hiding, and he said: ""By excluding the Awami League, a free and fair election is not possible.""
Should Sheikh Hasina order it, the party and its supporters would ""resist"" the elections, he warned. ""If she decides that people should not go to polling centres, then we will not go. If she says the election must be obstructed, then we will obstruct the election.""
He called accusations by independent human rights organisations of politically motivated arrests and extrajudicial killings during their time in power ""false"" and ""fabricated"".
After the vote next week, students will learn whether their revolution, and the bloodshed, were worth it.
Sitting by Dhaka's Jatrabari flyover where he lost his friend, Hossain is still waiting to see the trial against all police officers conclude.
Bhuiyan's own father is a police officer. When he identified his son's body, he called a senior officer in the force and asked: ""Sir, how many bullets does it take to kill a boy?""
Hossain says he's still haunted by the day his friend was shot.
He watched the video eight days later, when the country's internet had been restored. ""My entire screaming voice can be heard… I cried endlessly.""
A year later, he celebrated the first anniversary of Hasina's ousting on 5 August, alongside his other ""comrades of the uprising"".
But Hossain admits their ""new Bangladesh"" is not here yet. He believes that can't happen until an elected government reforms the country.
""One cannot expect mangoes from a tamarind tree,"" he says.

A global craze for Korean culture is making its humblest snacks unaffordable,2026-02-04T23:01:13.600Z," Yuna Ku
SeoulandSuhnwook Lee
Seoul
","Black, crispy, often flat and square - dried seaweed, known locally as gim - is a humble staple on everyday dining tables across South Korea. But as its global popularity grows, its rising prices are worrying gim-lovers nationwide.
Lee Hyang-ran has been selling gim for the past 47 years.
""In the past, people from Western countries thought Koreans were eating something weird that looks like a piece of black paper,"" the vendor, who is in her 60s, says from a small market stall in central Seoul.
""I never thought I'd be selling gim to them. But now, they all come here and buy it.""
South Korea is known to be the world's largest producer and exporter of gim, supplying markets across Asia, North America and Europe. Some even refer to the product as Korea's ""black semiconductor"", a reference to South Korea's large share of the global semiconductor industry.
Exports have risen steadily in recent years - and in 2025, South Korea's dried seaweed exports hit a record $1.13bn, according to the Korea Maritime Institute (KMI).
And as demand rises, so do prices.
Known locally as an affordable snack or ingredient, gim typically cost around 100 won ($0.06; £0.05) per sheet in 2024 - with the snack usually sold in bundles of 10 sheets or more, or around $0.60 per pack.
But last month, the price of one sheet of gim rose to above 150 won - a record high in the country.
""Premium products now cost as much as 350 won per sheet,"" said Lee.
Kim Jaela, who's in her 30s, typically buys gim in bulk - about 500 small sheets at a time, enough to last her several months.
But she says this may need to change, considering how expensive gim has become.
She does most of her grocery shopping online, and was checking prices on her phone during the interview.
""Oh my, it really did get more expensive by a few dollars! Luckily, I can survive a few more weeks with two packs of gim, but if I see the same or higher price later, I probably won't restock,"" she said.
The worldwide appetite for gim reflects a growing global demand in Korean goods, driven by cultural influences like K-pop and K-dramas.
As global audiences engage more deeply with such entertainment, they're also increasing looking to Korean cuisine, something businesses worldwide have picked up on.
In 2023, US supermarket chain Trader Joe's Gimbap - a Korean rice roll wrapped in seaweed - went viral and was cleared off the shelves nationwide shortly after its launch.
""I first learned about gim because it's a typical Korean food often seen in K-dramas,"" Miki, a 22-year-old visitor from Japan told the BBC.
""We do have similar thing called nori in Japan, but the taste is totally different. Gim is lighter and crispier, and is mostly grilled with sesame oil and salt, whereas nori is typically seasoned with soy sauce.""
Viola, a 60-year-old visitor from Brooklyn, New York, says she enjoys gim as a snack. ""I just pop it in my mouth like a potato chip,"" she said, adding that it feels like a ""healthier alternative"".
""From Asian to Western countries, more people are becoming familiar with gim, increasing global demand,"" said Lee Eunhee, a professor of consumer studies at Inha University. ""To meet overseas demand, domestic prices are being pushed up.""
Kim Namin, 29, runs a seasoned gim processing factory with a 30-year family history in Wando, an island in South Korea's southern waters known for abalone and seaweed production.
His factory purchases raw seaweed, grills it with oil and salt, and cuts it into the familiar rectangular sheets sold in stores.
Over the past five years, most of their products have been exported globally.
""There aren't enough gim factories compared to the rising demand,"" he said, saying that his family is now considering expanding operations.
He adds that gim is a highly price-sensitive staple in South Korea, long associated with affordability. Even marginal increases in its cost are keenly felt by consumers and tend to provoke strong public resistance - another reason why he's focusing more on overseas markets.
Government officials and experts say the price increase is being driven by multiple factors, including overall inflation, rising labour costs, and a decline in overseas production.
However, many agree that increased growing global demand remains a major driver.
In an effort to appease domestic consumers, companies - alongside the government - are taking steps to curb rising costs.
South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has pledged to closely monitor the situation to stabilise its price. and Korean food companies like Pulmone have plans to establish a land-based seaweed R&D centre, so they can be harvested throughout the year.
Back in Seoul, the market buzzes with tourists, and business is booming for Lee.
""Gim has been selling like hot cakes... the ones for making gimbap are especially popular,"" she says.
""I'm glad Korean gim is getting popular.""

The yachting industry searches for alternatives to teak,2026-02-04T13:42:07.307Z," Zoe Corbyn
Technology Reporter
San Francisco
","Tech titan Jeff Bezos's $500m (£366m) superyacht, Koru, delivered in 2023, uses teak in its interior and for its decking.
The dense and heavy tropical hardwood is prized for its remarkable properties such as rot and salt resistance, as well as its beauty and as a symbol of status and prestige.
The highest quality teak comes from old-growth trees, which are harvested from natural forests almost exclusively in Myanmar.
But sold by the country's military-linked sector, with little regard for sustainability, the timber is illegal to import into the UK, EU and US.
Trade sanctions were imposed on the sector in 2021 following the coup there, though imports were already heavily restricted under longstanding laws.
Netherlands-based shipyard Oceanco, which built the Koru for Bezos, was fined in late 2024 by the authorities there for using Myanmar teak in the yacht's interior.
Whether the Koru's deck is also illegal Myanmar teak – or comes from legal plantations elsewhere – is under investigation in Germany, where the first importer of the deck's wood appears to have been based.
Another luxury yacht maker, UK-based Sunseeker, was also fined in late 2024 for the use of Myanmar teak. Both Sunseeker and Oceanco have described their breaches as unintentional, with Sunseeker citing a lapse in due diligence.
It is a well-known problem that Myanmar teak continues to find its way into supply chains, passed off for example as plantation teak from other tropical countries.
Alternatives to the wood in the yacht industry are gaining traction.
They range from thermally-modified woods, to fully synthetic materials, to engineered teak laminates – and while options have been around for years, recent innovations, say the companies and some users, are making them better.
While prosecutions doubtless have an impact, driving the trend to alternatives is the exhaustion of pre-sanctions stockpiles of old-growth timber.
Meanwhile, plantation teak from younger trees is widely seen by high-end shipyards as inferior, rarely coming in the long, wide, dark-brown boards associated with quality.
Other natural woods that could serve as teak substitutes often struggle to meet the industry's exacting standards or are limited in supply.
Cork is sometimes used. The fact that it is harvested from bark that can regrow rather than by felling trees makes it a sustainable, low-carbon choice proponents say, though its appearance doesn't appeal to everyone.
""Alternatives to natural teak are very welcome,"" says Walter Kollert, a Portugal-based forestry consultant and member of the steering committee of TEAKNET, a non-profit international teak information network.
""We are in danger of losing old-growth teak forests which are part of a valuable ecosystem,"" he says.
While the furniture and housing industries also use old-growth teak, they have generally found it easier to substitute plantation teak than the yachting industry, he adds.
Last October major luxury yacht maker Sunreef Yachts, based in Poland and Dubai, announced it was transitioning away from teak decking altogether.
""Teak is no longer an option anywhere in our range …[and] I believe we are the only ones to do this,"" says Nicolas Lapp, the company's co-founder and chief technical officer.
The decision, he says, was driven both by the difficulty of sourcing high quality plantation teak and the company's push for greater sustainability.
When you buy plantation teaks, you have a lot of wood that's just not usable, says Lapp.
After testing alternatives to teak, the company now offers two thermally-modified woods – in which a different natural wood is enhanced through heat to resemble teak – though it is not divulging publicly yet which those products are.
Meanwhile, some small boat models use a recyclable synthetic deck.
The thermally modified woods not only match teak's visual appeal but are easier to clean, and offer better thermal performance – staying cooler in the sun and insulating the cabins below, reducing the need for air conditioning, notes Lapp.
One newer, thermally-modified wood product on the market is Tesumo, launched by a company of the same name in late 2021.
The operation is small, but business is booming, says Arne Petersen, its managing director, adding it is working to increase output.
There have been some examples in the past of thermally-modified wood which haven't been successful which can cloud perceptions of newer materials, but Tesumo is a viable alternative, Petersen argues.
The product, made in Germany, emerged from a research project involving the University of Göttingen and Lürssen shipyard – one of the world's most prestigious yacht builders – after it struggled to find a good natural alternative to old-growth teak.
It starts with a fast-growing undisclosed African hardwood which is heat-treated and then further processed, including with resin impregnation.
High-profile installations so far include one of the helipads on the Lürssen-built superyacht Dragonfly, reportedly owned by Google co-founder Sergey Bryn, and the complete deck of Boardwalk, another Lürssen-built superyacht linked to US businessman Tilman Fertitta, owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team.
Synthetic alternatives, including plastics, are also evolving. Among the earliest was Flexiteek, a UK-made PVC teak substitute introduced in 2000 and which is widely regarded as the market leader in its category.
In late 2024, the company launched its third-generation product.
It is easier to clean than real teak, retains its colour as teak greys over time, and has improved thermal performance compared to earlier versions says Steve Moore, the company's marketing manager.
Richard Strauss the CEO of Teakdecking Systems has experience of the challenges of sourcing teak.
Teakdecking Systems manufactured the decks for the Koru at its factory in Spain. Strauss says the teak used on the deck was purchased through a wood trader within the EU.
All the company's teak is ""purchased with validation of the chain of custody paperwork by a third party firm,"" he says.
The company fits decks using either plantation teak mostly sourced from India, or a small handful of alternatives it has had good success with. That includes a laminated wood product, Green Teak, which comes from Thailand.
Laminated teak is an engineered product in which plantation-grown teak, that would normally be rejected for high-end decking, is thinly sliced and glued together to form a strong, stable material.
""You are kind of tricking the eye…[and in the process] using far more of the log,"" says Strauss.
Meanwhile old habits die hard. Strauss notes that plantation teak is still the most popular among his customers.
Lapp of Sunreef says what's really needed is a wider culture shift away from teak altogether.
Customers typically start with wanting teak until they learn the problem and that alternatives can offer benefits.
""Then we show them… and they realise they can't tell the difference,"" says Lapp.
However, small UK family yacht building business Jeremy Rogers is sticking with teak for now – sourced from older government-managed plantations in Java that it is confident are authentic and harvested sustainably.
The firm is keen to adopt a genuinely sustainable substitute that performs well, but its past experiments with alternatives have mostly fallen short, says Jessie Rogers.
""The problem for the alternatives is there is nothing quite like real teak,"" she says.
Correction 4 February: This article was amended to provide further details about Teakdecking Systems' role in making the teak deck for the Koru which were not included in an earlier version.

India's regulator investigates after jets brush wingtips at Mumbai airport,2026-02-04T07:51:35.866Z," Abhishek Dey
","India's civil aviation regulator has launched an investigation after the wingtips of two passenger aircraft briefly came into contact on a runway at Mumbai airport, prompting an evacuation of passengers.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said an Air India aircraft was awaiting departure when an IndiGo plane, taxiing on a parallel route after landing, scraped the tip of its wing.
""The right wingtips of both aircraft touched each other,"" the regulator said.
Both airlines confirmed that all passengers and crew were safe. The two Airbus A320 aircraft involved have been grounded for inspection.
The incident took place around 19:30 local time (14:00 GMT) on Tuesday.
The Air India flight was scheduled to depart for Coimbatore in southern India, while the IndiGo aircraft had just arrived from Hyderabad city, the airlines said.
Neither the airlines nor the DGCA have disclosed the number of passengers or crew on board.
However, an executive at one of the airlines told the BBC on the condition of anonymity that Airbus A320 aircraft operating domestic routes in India typically carry between 150 and 186 passengers, with six to eight crew members.
An Air India spokesperson said the aircraft sustained damage to its wingtip and that alternative arrangements were made for affected passengers.
IndiGo also confirmed that all its passengers were safe and had disembarked after parking, adding that an inquiry was under way.
The incident comes amid heightened scrutiny of aviation safety in India following a series of technical and ground-handling issues.
On Sunday, an Air India flight was grounded following its landing in Bengaluru city after a pilot reported that the fuel control switch had malfunctioned - though the regulator later said no defect was found and the aircraft had completed its flight safely.
In January, the DGCA had launched an investigation after an Air India Airbus A350's engine sucked in a cargo container while taxiing at Delhi airport.
Authorities have said the incidents are being examined individually in line with standard safety procedures.

Draco Malfoy becomes unlikely Lunar New Year mascot in China,2026-02-04T05:08:37.489Z," Koh Ewe
","An unlikely Lunar New Year mascot has popped up in China this year - Draco Malfoy.
Tom Felton is best known for his role in the Harry Potter series, but now, the actor is also making an appearance in some Chinese houses, with e-commerce sites selling festive decor prominently featuring his face.
His sudden popularity is thanks to his Chinese translation of his name Malfoy, Ma-er-fu. It contains the words for horse and fortune, ringing especially auspicious for the upcoming Year of the Horse.
Harry Potter is hugely popular in China, with hundreds of millions of books sold. A re-release of the series' first film in 2020 grossed more than 90 million yuan ($13.6m; £9.4m) in three days.
Ahead of Lunar New Year this month, Chinese households typically decorate their doors with couplets - a set of auspicious writings heralding health and prosperity in the new year.
Others decorate their houses with fuzi - red square papers printed with the Chinese word for prosperity.
The fuzi are commonly hung upside down to symbolise luck arriving in the household, as the Chinese word for upside down has the same pronunciation as the word for arrival.
On Chinese social media, pictures show some users sticking couplets or upside down pictures of Malfoy's signature smirk.
Merchants on e-commerce site Taobao are also seizing on the trend, coming up with stickers and magnets featuring the Harry Potter character.
Others began sharing photos of the character, saying: ""Share this image for good fortune"".
""[It's an] oriental new year with magical elements,"" one user on social media site Weibo commented.
""Felix Felicis!"" said one comment, a reference to a potion in the series that makes the drinker lucky for a period of time.
The Malfoy themed Lunar New Year decor has even caught the eye of actor Felton, who reshared an Instagram story about his character becoming a ""symbol of Chinese New Year in China"".
His acknowledgement sparked even more excitement on Chinese social media, with many fans praising him with the hashtag ""Malfoy himself is 100% hilarious"".
The wizard franchise enjoys a fervent and huge fanbase in China - and Warner Bros Discovery has announced plans to open the largest Making Of Harry Potter studio tour in Shanghai in 2027.

Rights groups say China detained two journalists over corruption report,2026-02-04T03:42:17.571Z," Koh Ewe
","Rights groups and activists are sounding the alarm about the detention of two Chinese investigative journalists after they reportedly exposed corruption by a senior official in Sichuan province.
Independent journalists Liu Hu and Wu Yingjiao were taken by police on Sunday after they published their investigation, rights groups say.
Critics have long flagged concern about media repression in China, where authorities have arrested and prosecuted journalists, accusing them of causing trouble.
Chengdu police said on Monday that two men, identified by their surnames Liu and Wu and aged 50 and 34, were under investigation for ""making false accusations"" and ""illegal business operations"".
In response a question about the arrests, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters on Wednesday that relevant authorities had already released information on the case.
""China is a country ruled by law, and Chinese judicial organs handle cases according to law; everyone is equal in face of the law,"" the spokesperson said.
Liu, a prominent investigative reporter in China, was previously arrested in 2013 on suspicion of defamation after accusing a high-ranking official of corruption.
After his release in 2014, he continued his investigations and published his reports on social media.
Wu is frequently listed as Liu's collaborator on a public WeChat account where Liu and other journalists post news articles.
According to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, which is a coalition of Chinese and international activists and groups, Liu had planned to take a train from his home city of Chongqing to the capital Beijing on Sunday when he went missing.
Wu was taken by police in Hebei province on the same day, the group said.
According to rights groups, the pair's recent report had exposed a county official's alleged corruption.
The title of the report - which cannot be found on WeChat any more - had referred to businesses driven to bankruptcy due to the official's actions.
Before Liu's arrest this week, he had posted to WeChat several messages he had received from a Chengdu disciplinary inspection official urging him to contact authorities rather than publish reports in the media, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said.
""This arrest highlights just how restrictive and hostile China has become toward independent reporting,"" RSF advocacy manager Aleksandra Bielakowska said in a statement.
""We call on the international community to intensify pressure on the Chinese regime, rather than pursue a normalisation of relations that only enables further repression and allows the authorities to continue targeting reliable reporters.""
There are more than 120 journalists detained in China, according to RSF, which calls the country ""the world's biggest jailer of journalists"".

'Never imagined this': Indian village grapples with interfaith couple's killing,2026-02-04T00:32:53.581Z," Abhishek Dey
","The murder of an interfaith couple and the arrest of the woman's brothers by the police for the alleged crime has shocked a small village in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state where residents have lived in harmony for years.
The bodies of 19-year-old Kajal, a Hindu, and 27-year-old Mohammad Arman, a Muslim, were found buried near a riverbank on the outskirts of Umri village on 21 January.
Police said they were beaten to death with a spade two days earlier, allegedly by Kajal's three brothers, who have been arrested. They are in custody and have not commented on the killings.
The murders have left an uneasy quiet hanging over Umri, 182km (113 miles) from India's capital Delhi. The village is home to about 400 families - from both Hindu and Muslim communities - and several resident told the BBC that they have shared a warm relationship without any history of religious disputes.
Deputy inspector general of state police Muniraj G told the BBC that police believe it to be a case of ""honour killing"" - murder by relatives or community members to punish women for falling in love or marrying outside of their caste or religion.
India's National Crime Records Bureau began recording honour killings in 2014, when it listed 18 cases nationwide. Its latest annual report recorded 38 such cases in 2023.
Activists, however, say the numbers are significantly higher - in hundreds every year - as many cases are recorded simply as homicide.
Umri is in Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad district, which is known for its metal craft industries. The region is largely rural, where strong social hierarchies continue to influence everyday life. Kajal's brothers worked as masons in Moradabad town.
Kajal and Arman's relationship ""was the first case [of an interfaith relationship]"" in their village, says resident Mahipal Saini.
Residents of Umri who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said Kajal and Arman were neighbours who lived hardly 200m from each other. They described them as introverts who did not have many friends.
Kajal taught at a private school in Umri, while Arman had returned to the village about five months ago after spending four years in Saudi Arabia where he worked at a food outlet. His relatives said he came back as he didn't earn much there and had been working with a local stone-crushing contractor since his return.
It's not clear how they met and how long they had been a couple, but police say that ""the two were close"".
They say the murders allegedly took place in Kajal's house on the intervening night of 18 and 19 January, when her brothers caught Arman visiting her. The brothers - Rajaram, Satish and Rinku Saini - are in jail and have not said anything in their defence so far.
Their father, Ganpat Saini, told the BBC that he and his wife were not at home at the time of the murders. He said they were sleeping in a shed on the outskirts of the village where they usually spend nights to guard their livestock. He added that he was grieving his daughter.
Arman's elder brother Farman Ali said that his brother left home after dinner on 18 January, saying he would be back with some medicines for their parents. When he hadn't returned by the next morning and his phone was switched off, his family started panicking and went to the police. This led to a search operation in the village.
Police allege that Kajal's brothers attempted to mislead them by lodging a missing complaint about her on 20 January, accusing Arman of abducting her.
They say they questioned both the families and found discrepancies in the statements of Kajal's brothers.
Further investigation led them to the spot where the bodies were buried, police said.
Ganpat Saini says that when he and his wife returned home on the morning of 19 January, they could not find Kajal at home. He says he learnt about the murder only after the bodies were found.
He, however, did not answer when asked whether he or anyone in his family knew that Kajal and Arman were in a relationship.
Arman's family say they were unaware of his relationship with Kajal.
""He never told us anything,"" brother Farman Ali says. ""After we couldn't find him for a whole day, some of his friends told us that he had been seeing Kajal for about two months.""
Villagers say they usually resolve disputes with help from elected village council leaders. ""If the family [of Kajal] had acted more reasonably, the elders in the village could have helped resolve it,"" says villager Mahipal Saini.
Police say they have deployed personnel to ensure there is no religious violence. And villagers say their lives are slowly returning to routine.
The killings, some say, have forced an uneasy reflection.
""We never imagined something like this could happen here,"" says Arif Ali, another Umri resident. ""It's not that men and women in the village have suddenly started feeling unsafe. But there is a silence that hangs over us.""
The Umri murders join the long list of suspected ""honour killing"" cases reported from across India over decades.
More than 93% marriages in India are ""arranged"" by families within their own caste and faith and couples who deviate from the tradition are routinely forced to seek protection from police or courts.
Indian law regards ""honour killings"" as murder and courts have repeatedly affirmed that an adult's choice of partner by consent is constitutionally protected. In 2018, the country's top court mandated state governments to set up safe houses in every district to protect inter-faith and inter-caste couples from harassment.
Yet cases of violence continue to be reported from across states.
Research shows most Indians oppose inter-faith marriages, and controversial laws against religious conversion implemented in several states often keep such couples on edge.
Filmmaker Nakul Singh Sawhney, who made a documentary on the subject in 2012, says the official data on honour killing is far from adequate.
""Most cases don't make it to the official data unless the motive is clearly mentioned at the first stage of the police reports. And in many cases the honour killing angle emerges much later during investigation,"" says Sawhney.
Human rights activist Kavita Srivastava says the failure to recognise the scale of the so-called honour crimes contributes to official indifference. ""When the problem is not seen, it is not acted upon,"" she says.
As women increasingly assert their right to choose their partners, Srivastava adds, they often encounter resistance from what she describes as ""a deeply regressive social system"".
Court orders, she says, alone cannot prevent ""honour crimes"" unless broader social attitudes are confronted.

The Chinese planemaker taking on Boeing and Airbus,2026-02-03T23:04:49.128Z," Suranjana Tewari
Asia Business Correspondent
","At the Singapore Airshow, the exhibition halls are lined with scale models, mock cockpits, and interactive displays showing the latest commercial jets and aviation technology.
One booth is drawing particular attention: Comac, China's state-owned planemaker, which has made significant strides since its C919 passenger jet flew to Singapore in its first trip outside of Chinese territory two years ago.
The plane is designed to compete with the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX and is increasingly targeting markets beyond China.
In its own words ""Comac is setting sights on the Southeast Asian aviation market"".
For the company, the airshow is a chance to position itself as a potential rival to Airbus and Boeing in Asia-Pacific, the world's fastest-growing aviation market, at a time when airlines are grappling with delivery delays and stretched supply chains.
""I think in time, Comac will be a global competitor... but it's going to take them time,"" Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) told the BBC.
""I think 10 years, 15 years from now, we'll be talking about Boeing, Airbus and Comac... But without question, they will be a considerable player in the future.""
There is certainly a need for another planemaker in Asia Pacific, analysts say.
Airlines in the region are feeling the strain from delivery delays at Boeing and Airbus, compounded by a shortage of engines and broader supply chain bottlenecks.
Uncertainty over tariffs and trade tensions has further complicated challenges for the manufacturing sector, affecting procurement and growth strategy in the region.
IATA data shows that global carriers are waiting longer than ever for new aircraft, pushing the average fleet age up and increasing operating costs because older planes are less fuel efficient.
Walsh said that Asia Pacific airlines could see double digit growth in 2026 if planes were available. ""It's incredibly frustrating for airlines. The wait between making an order and taking delivery is about seven years,"" he said.
This is why Comac is emerging as another option for many Asia Pacific airlines.
The company says it has delivered more than 200 C909 and C919 jets, with around a quarter of those planes being operated by airlines in Laos, Indonesia and Vietnam. Brunei's GallopAir has placed a large order for the firm's aircraft, and Cambodia is also planning to buy around 20 planes.
""We need more suppliers in the supply chain,"" said Subhas Menon, director general of the Association for Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA). ""The problem with this industry is that the supply chain is an oligopoly and sometimes even a duopoly.""
""We have been waiting for this for a long time. Comac is a welcome introduction. We need more suppliers in the Asia Pacific especially.""
The company is in a good position with strong government support, and lower prices can make its aircraft appealing to budget airlines in emerging markets.
""In the future we welcome all newcomers. We are keen to see more competition. Comac has got its certification process to go through and at some point in the 2030s, we see that it will be an offering that would be attractive to ourselves and other carriers,"" Mike Szucs, chief executive of low-cost Philippines carrier Cebu Pacific told the BBC.
As well as expanding in Asia Pacific, Comac is also pursuing European certification, with regulators conducting test flights on its C919. This would allow it to sell to European carriers.
However, the road ahead remains long.
European certification could take until 2028 or even 2031, regulators say. Meanwhile, harmonising a mix of Chinese and Western parts, flight controls, and software also presents technical challenges for international orders.
Maintenance and repair infrastructure is another hurdle, as is pilot training - areas where manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus have had infrastructure and systems set up for decades.
And in Asia Pacific, Comac has some competition beyond Boeing and Airbus.
Brazil's Embraer has carved out a foothold in the region with Singapore budget carrier Scoot, Virgin Australia and Japan's All Nippon Airlines (ANA) placing orders for Embraer jets.
Meanwhile, Boeing and Airbus still have a strong presence at the Singapore Airshow and the region as a whole. Both manufacturers are signalling to local carriers that aircraft delivery delays, which have frustrated airlines for years, are beginning to improve.
""We are pleased to say that we might be seeing light at the end of tunnel,"" Mike Szucs of Cebu Pacific said.
There are questions about Comac's order numbers, too. It has previously said it has more than 1,000 C919 passenger plane orders to Chinese airlines, but only a dozen have been delivered so far.
And verifying these order numbers is difficult as Comac is a state-owned Chinese company not a publicly listed one like Boeing or Airbus.
Unless Comac can address some or all of these issues, Boeing and Airbus are likely to continue controlling the skies above Asia Pacific.

No defect found in switch of jet grounded by Air India - regulator,2026-02-03T13:02:11.649Z," Cherylann Mollan

Delhi
","India's aviation regulator said it found no defect in the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner jet grounded by Air India based on a pilot's report.
The issue was reported on Sunday after the plane, which took off from London, landed in Indian's Bengaluru city.
The regulator said that while starting the engine during take-off, the crew noticed that twice the fuel control switch - which regulates the flow of fuel into the plane's engines - did not ""remain positively latched in the run position when light vertical pressure was applied"".
It remained stable the third time and the crew closely monitored the aircraft during the flight, which ""was completed without incident"".
Air India had said in a statement on Monday that it informed India's aviation regulator about the issue and that it was getting the pilot's concerns checked on a ""priority basis"". A Boeing spokesperson had told the BBC in response to a question that the company was supporting Air India's ""review of this matter"".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Tuesday that when the switches were operated according to Boeing's recommended procedure, they were found to be ""satisfactory"", staying at run instead of moving to cut-off (which can stop fuel supply to the engines).
It added, however, that incorrectly handling the switch caused it to ""move easily from run to cut-off"".
These checks were performed in the presence of DGCA officials on the affected aircraft and another aircraft, the statement said. The DGCA has also asked Air India to circulate Boeing's recommended procedure to operate the switch to its crew members.
The grounding of the plane gained a lot of attention as it came amid an ongoing investigation into last June's plane crash involving an Air India aircraft of the same model which killed 260 people.
The crash of the London-bound Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner occurred less than a minute after the plane took off from Ahmedabad airport in western India.
India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is investigating the crash and a final report is expected to be released in a few months.
A preliminary report last July said that the plane's engines shut down after its fuel switches moved from the 'run' to the 'cut-off' position shortly after take-off, but did not establish how this had happened.
Air India crash plane had record of safety defects, campaigners claim
Why cockpit audio deepens the mystery of Air India crash
After the report was released, the US aviation regulator said that fuel control switches in Boeing airplanes were safe.
India's aviation regulator had also ordered an investigation of cockpit fuel switches in Boeing 787 and Boeing 737 aircraft operating in the country after the crash. Air India had said then that its inspections did not find any issue with the locking mechanism of the switch, which it reiterated on Monday.
""Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA [Directorate General of Civil Aviation], and had found no issues,"" the airline said in the statement.
On Tuesday, Reuters news agency reported that Air India had begun re-checking the fuel switches on its Boeing Dreamliner aircraft following the incident flagged by the pilot.
Aviation consultant and former air accident investigator Tim Atkinson told the BBC that he trusted Boeing's design of the fuel control switches.
""These switches are designed with one purpose in mind, and that is that they cannot be moved unintentionally. There is no doubt in my mind that the design is good. I would be astonished to find it had some kind of latent defect,"" he said.

Beijing criticises Dalai Lama Grammy win as 'manipulation',2026-02-02T12:44:33.030Z," Doug Faulkner
","China has reacted angrily to an unlikely winner at the Grammys - the Dalai Lama - saying it opposes art awards being used for ""anti-China political manipulation"".
The Buddhist spiritual leader was recognised in the audiobook category for Meditations: The Reflections of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.
The Dalai Lama said he accepted the award with ""gratitude and humility"".
The 90-year-old has lived in exile from his Tibetan homeland since 1959 and is condemned as a rebel and separatist by Beijing.
China's foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a news conference: ""We firmly oppose relevant parties using art awards as a tool for anti-China political manipulation, and this position is consistent and clear.""
The spiritual leader, who lives in Dharamshala in India, left China in fear of his life after Chinese troops crushed an uprising. He has campaigned for more autonomy for Tibet, but Beijing considers it an integral part of China.
In a message on social media the Dalai Lama, who is also a Nobel peace laureate, said: ""I receive this recognition with gratitude and humility.
""I don't see it as something personal, but as a recognition of our shared universal responsibility.""
The award was collected on his behalf by musician Rufus Wainwright, who was among the artists to feature on the audiobook.
Last year the Dalai Lama confirmed plans to name a successor, which has caused further friction with China.
According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the Dalai Lama is reincarnated after death - a process deeply rooted in spiritual customs, not political authority.
He has previously said his reincarnation will take place in the ""free world"", meaning outside of atheist and communist China but Beijing swiftly rejected his authority to determine a successor.
Chinese officials insist that any succession must follow Chinese laws, religious rituals and historical conventions - and ultimately be approved by the government in Beijing.
The announcement has reignited fears among Tibetans in exile that China will attempt to name a successor to tighten control over Tibet, the region it occupied in 1950 and has ruled ever since.

China executes four more Myanmar mafia members,2026-02-02T04:00:51.454Z," Koh Ewe
","China has executed four members of the Bai family mafia, one of the notorious dynasties that ran scam centres in Myanmar, state media report.
They were among 21 of the family's members and associates who were convicted of fraud, homicide, injury and other crimes by a court in Guangdong province.
Last November the court sentenced five of them to death including the clan's patriarch Bai Suocheng, who died of illness after his conviction, state media reported.
Last week, China executed 11 members of the Ming family mafia as part of its crackdown on scam operations in South East Asia that have entrapped thousands of Chinese victims.
For years, the Bais, Mings and several other families dominated Myanmar's border town of Laukkaing, where they ran casinos, red-light districts and cyberscam operations.
Among the clans, the Bais were ""number one"", Bai Suocheng's son previously told state media after he was detained.
The Bais, who controlled their own militia, established 41 compounds to house cyberscam activities and casinos, authorities said. Within the walls of those compounds was a culture of violence, where beatings and torture were routine.
The Bai family's criminal activities led to the deaths of six Chinese citizens, the suicide of one person and multiple injuries, the court said.

The Bais rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s after the town's then warlord was ousted in a military operation led by Min Aung Hlaing - who now leads Myanmar's military government.
The military leader had been looking for co-operative allies, and Bai Suocheng - then a deputy of the warlord - fitted the bill.
But the families' empires crashed in 2023, when Beijing became frustrated by the Myanmar military's inaction on the scam operations and tacitly backed an offensive by ethnic insurgents in the area, which marked a turning point in Myanmar's civil war.
That led to the capture of the scam mafias and their members were handed to Beijing.
In China, they became subjects of state documentaries which emphasised Chinese authorities' resolve to eradicate the scam networks.
With these recent executions Beijing appears to be sending a message of deterrence to would-be scammers.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia, according to estimates by the United Nations.
Among them are thousands of Chinese people, and their victims who they swindle billions of dollars from are mainly Chinese as well.

India's snakebite crisis is killing tens of thousands every year,2026-02-02T01:38:10.203Z," Cherylann Mollan
Mumbai
","Devendra, who was a farmer in India, still remembers the moment a snake sank its fangs into his leg while he was picking mulberry leaves.
""I went to the hospital four days after I was bitten, when the pain became unbearable. But the delay cost me my leg,"" he says in a short film released by Global Snakebite Taskforce (GST), an initiative working to reduce deaths and injuries by snakebites.
But Devendra is still among the lucky few to have survived. According to the federal government, around 50,000 Indians are killed by snakebites each year - roughly half of all deaths worldwide. Some estimates suggest the toll could be even higher: between 2000 and 2019, India may have seen as many as 1.2 million deaths, an average of 58,000 per year, a 2020 study said.
Now, a new report by GST has found that 99% of healthcare workers in India face challenges administering antivenom - the life-saving antibodies that neutralise toxins in venom. Researchers surveyed 904 medical professionals across India, Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria, the countries most affected by snakebites, and found similar barriers: poor infrastructure, limited access to antivenom and insufficient training.
Nearly half of the professionals reported that delays in treatment had led to serious complications in their patients, including amputations, surgeries or lifelong mobility problems.
In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally listed snakebite envenoming or poisoning as a ""highest priority neglected tropical disease"" because of the high number of deaths caused by it. An estimated 5.4 million people worldwide are bitten by snakes each year and more than 100,000 die from annually, according to the WHO.
It also states that snakebites disproportionately affect poor rural communities in low and middle-income countries.
In India, a high concentration of snakebite deaths and injuries are reported in the central and eastern regions, says Dr Yogesh Jain, a GST member and practitioner in the central Chhattisgarh state. He adds that people working in farms, including those from poor tribal communities, remain most vulnerable.
In 2024, India launched the National Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Snakebite Envenoming (NAPSE) with the aim to halve snakebite deaths by 2030. The plan focuses on better surveillance, improved antivenom availability and research, enhanced medical capacity and public awareness campaigns.
Experts agree it is a step in the right direction, but implementation has been inconsistent.
""In India, snakebites are seen as a poor person's problem,"" Jain says. ""That's why there isn't enough outrage or action over these completely avoidable deaths. When it comes to treating snakebites, every second counts.""
He explains that snake venom enters the bloodstream within minutes, attacking nerves, cells or the circulatory system, depending on the species. Delays in antivenom administration can result in respiratory failure, paralysis, irreversible tissue damage or organ failure.
Yet, delays to hospital care are common in rural India, where bad roads, far-flung hospitals and a dearth of ambulance services prevent timely treatment.
Last September, a pregnant woman in Gujarat state reportedly died on the way to a hospital after her family had to carry her in a cloth sling for 5km (3 miles) because no vehicle could reach their hamlet.
Jain says that some states are trying to improve access by stocking antivenom in primary and community health centres. But administering it correctly remains a major challenge.
Many health workers are not trained professionals and fear giving antivenom because patients can sometimes develop adverse reactions.
""The antivenom is mixed with saline and injected intravenously over an hour, but many centres aren't equipped to manage the side-effects,"" Jain says.
Another problem, he adds, is that many people in rural India still rely on faith healers or local medicinal practices and go to hospitals only when their symptoms worsen, which can be lethal.
Gerry Martin, co-founder of The Liana Trust, which works to reduce human-snake conflict in Karnataka state, says another major hurdle is the availability of high-quality antivenom.
Currently, India has antivenom that only protects against the ""big four"" snakes - the spectacled cobra, common krait, Russell's viper and the saw-scaled viper - which are believed to be responsible for a majority of the bites. The antivenom is produced by injecting venom from these snakes into horses, whose antibodies are then used as treatment for humans, Martin explains.
But there are dozens of other poisonous snake species for which India does not have targeted antivenom. These include the green pit viper commonly found in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, the Malabar pit viper and hump-nosed pit viper found in southern states and many other species in the north-eastern states.
A study by Aiims (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, last year highlighted the problem. It found that when antivenom used to treat bites by saw-scaled vipers was administered to 105 snake bite patients (where the species remained unknown), two-thirds did not respond well to treatment.
The study concluded that there was an urgent need for ""region-specific antivenom in western India"".
For the past five years, The Liana Trust has been studying venoms from species beyond the big four to develop antidotes to them. But progress has been slow, Martin says, because the process is labour-intensive and time-consuming.
He called on states to emulate the 2024 order from the government of the southern state of Karnataka which made snakebites ""a notifiable disease"" - making it compulsory for health professionals to report it to the authorities - to combat under-reporting.
Jain agrees. ""Snakebite deaths start where political will ends,"" he says.
""Governments should ensure that poor people don't get poor health systems. They deserve better.""

Deadly gun and bomb attacks hit Pakistan's Balochistan province,2026-02-01T10:08:55.441Z," Jaroslav Lukiv
","A series of gun and bomb attacks across Pakistan's south-western Balochistan province have killed 31 civilians and 17 security service personnel, the region's Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti says.
Security forces responding to the violence killed at least 145 attackers during a 40-hour gun battle, he said. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group had earlier said it was behind the attacks, claiming dozens of soldiers were killed.
It marks an escalation of violence in the impoverished but resource-rich province, where Pakistan's government has been battling an ethnic insurgency for decades.
Pakistan accused India of supporting the BLA. Delhi has repeatedly denied such accusations.
Grenade and gun attacks in the provincial capital Quetta and cities and towns across the province targeted hospitals, schools, banks and markets, Pakistan's junior interior minister Talal Chaudhry said.
""In each case, the attackers came in dressed as civilians and indiscriminately targeted ordinary people working in shops,"" he said, adding that the attackers had used civilians as human shields.
Armed attackers also opened fire at security installations, attempted to carry out suicide bombings and briefly blocked roads in urban areas.
Some key administrative buildings in Quetta and nearby roads were reported to have been sealed off during the day. Mobile phone services were jammed, and regional train services were suspended.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later praised the military, pledging to ""continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication"".
The BLA said it had launched a coordinated operation dubbed Herof, or ""black storm"" against security forces, and claimed to have killed 84 members of the security forces and kidnapped a further 18. The claim has not been independently verified and the Pakistani military has not commented.
The BLA accuses Pakistan's federal government of exploiting the rich mineral resources of its largest province without the local population benefiting.
Local activists also blame Pakistani security forces for enforced disappearances, which Islamabad denies.
Balochistan covers nearly 44% of the country's total land, sharing a volatile border with Iran and Afghanistan and covering part of the Arabian Sea coastline. It is home to about 5% of the country's more than 240 million people.
The province is also the richest in terms of natural resources, including gas and minerals.
The region derives its name from the Baloch tribe, which is the largest ethnic group there. Resistance against the Pakistani government and an insurgency advocating for an independent state for the Baloch people began in 1948, after Pakistan gained independence from the British Empire.

Rare earths and data centres: India pushes local industry as global tensions rise,2026-02-01T09:15:44.141Z," Nikhil Inamdar
Mumbai
","India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has presented her annual budget for 2026-27, announcing higher infrastructure spending and measures to support domestic manufacturing amid rising global uncertainties.
India is expected to close this financial year with 7.4% gross domestic product (GDP) growth according to the country's Economic Survey, but economic expansion will slow slightly next year as US President Donald Trump's 50% tariffs on Indian exporters start taking a greater toll.
The budget has laid a strong emphasis on fiscal restraint, targeting a lower deficit for the upcoming financial year. The fiscal deficit is the gap between the government's total expenditure and its total revenue.
Here are five key takeaways from the budget announcements:
Infrastructure such as road, port and railway projects has been a mainstay focus of the Narendra Modi government for the past decade, and this budget continues to expand allocations to these sectors.
The capital spending target for the upcoming financial year beginning 1 April has gone up some 9% to 12.2tn rupees ($133.1bn; £105bn) from 11.1tn rupees.
Outlays for defence have also jumped by over 20% in the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions globally.
The government has proposed to scale up manufacturing in seven strategic sectors including semiconductors, data centres, textiles and rare earths, amid slowing private investments and a flight of foreign capital from India.
Sitharaman announced that dedicated corridors will be set up for rare earth minerals in four states, including Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh in the south and Odisha in the east. The announcement follows India's approval of a 73bn-rupee rare earths scheme unveiled in November.
The budget also launched a second semiconductor mission with an outlay of $436m to produce equipment and materials and design full-stack intellectual property.
India is also proposing a tax holiday up to 2047 for foreign cloud companies making data-centre investments in the country and providing cloud services to customers globally. India has been attracting billions of dollars of data centre investments with the likes of Google last year announcing a $15bn investment in a facility in southern India.
This provides ""long-term fiscal certainty for a highly capital-intensive sector, significantly improving investment viability and accelerating capacity creation"", said Ritika Loganey Gupta of Ernst & Young India.
The budget has also announced new mega-textiles parks to enhance India's exports competitiveness in the labour-intensive garments industry - expected to benefit from greater global market access following last week's India-EU free trade agreement.
Amid slowing exports because of US tariffs, India has proposed raising limits on duty-free inputs for industries such as seafood, which are major export sectors. Customs duty exemptions have also been allowed for inputs used to manufacture lithium-ion batteries.
But no direct tax cuts have been announced on personal incomes. This was expected as Modi's government had raised income tax exemption limits last year, making earnings of up to 1.2m rupees - excluding special rate income like capital gains - entirely tax-free. There was also a rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST), leaving little fiscal room for fresh cuts.
Starting April 2026, the government has shifted from targeting a rigid yearly fiscal deficit - the gap between revenue and expenditure - to focusing on the overall debt-to-GDP ratio, which is a country's total government debt to the size of the economy.
The government now aims to bring down this ratio from 56% to 50% (+/-1%) by 2030-31 - this will give Delhi more flexibility to spend on higher capital expenditure and adapt its spending needs more effectively, according to economists.
The debt-to-GDP ratio for the upcoming financial year is estimated to ease to 55.6%, and the fiscal deficit estimated to come down from 4.4% to 4.3% of GDP.
Despite strong signalling on fiscal discipline, the financial markets, which were open in special trading on Sunday because of the budget, fell sharply as the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options trading was raised.
""Coming on top of last year's hike, this is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers and arbitrageurs. This could cool derivative activity and lead to a reduction in volumes,"" said Shripal Shah, managing director and CEO of Kotak Securities.

Pokémon cancels event at controversial Japan shrine following backlash,2026-01-31T12:08:05.840Z," Aleks Phillips
","A Pokémon card game event at a shrine honouring Japan's war dead has been cancelled following a backlash in China.
The Pokémon Company apologised for advertising the event, organised by a certified third party, through its official website, and said it ""should not have been held in the first place"".
The event was due to be held on Saturday at the Yasukuni Shrine, near the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, which commemorates those who died in several wars including convicted war criminals.
The blunder comes at a moment of worsening relations between China and Japan over the stance of the latter's new prime minister on Taiwan.
The Yasukuni Shrine honours Japanese soldiers who died in a number of wars, including both Sino-Japanese wars and the Pacific theatre of World War Two.
But the enshrinement of the names of more than 1,000 convicted war criminals among the roughly 2.5 million people it honours has long made it a controversial site for nations that were subject to harsh treatment under Japanese occupation.
""Brands that disregard history and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people will ultimately be abandoned,"" the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official news site, commented when the event came to light earlier this week.
""The relevant enterprises must accordingly take social responsibility and not make light of the heavy weight of history in the name of entertainment.""
Meanwhile, the state-run Global Times praised ""China's young net­izens"" for criticising the event, adding: ""Any enter­tain­ment or leis­ure activ­it­ies held at such a site con­sti­tute an open affront to his­tor­ical truth, and sta­ging events aimed at children there is even more egre­gious.""
The Pokémon Company said in a statement on Friday that the event had been ""mistakenly posted"" on its official card game website ""due to a lack of due diligence"".
""After the incident was discovered, the event was promptly cancelled,"" it said. ""We sincerely apologise for the various reactions and opinions that have been generated as a result of this publication.""
The firm said it would ""thoroughly review and strengthen"" its approval process to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.
The incident comes after a row with China sparked by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's suggestion in November that Tokyo could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan.
Beijing claims the self-governing island as part of its territory, and has not ruled out taking it by force.
The row saw the governments of both nations urge their citizens not to travel to the other, while the release of two popular Japanese films in China were also postponed.
Pokémon, which began as a video game in 1996, has since become an internationally renowned media franchise spanning films, TV series and trading card games.

An ingredient for this curry is missing - and in eight minutes it's at the door,2026-01-31T00:01:04.190Z," Nikita Yadav
Delhi
","Tanisha Singh is getting ready for work early one morning and cooking a simple curry for her lunchbox when she realises she's out of tomatoes.
Onions are already frying in the pan. Going out to buy vegetables is not an option, as local vegetable vendors won't be open.
So Tanisha picks up her phone. On a quick-delivery app, tomatoes are available.
Eight minutes later, the doorbell rings. The tomatoes have arrived.
What might feel remarkable in some parts of the world has become commonplace in Delhi and other big Indian cities. Groceries, books, soft drinks and even the occasional iPhone can now be delivered to people's doorsteps in minutes.
It's a convenience many don't strictly need, yet have quickly grown used to.
Unlike traditional retailers, platforms such as Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto don't deliver from large supermarkets or distant warehouses. Instead, they operate out of small storage units embedded deep inside residential neighbourhoods.
Known as ""dark stores"", these facilities are typically located just a few kilometres from customers, allowing delivery riders to reach homes in minutes.
Think of them as a mini version of Costco - packed with essentials, but designed purely for speed. And because customers never walk into these spaces, everything inside is arranged for fast picking rather than browsing.
To see how this works, the BBC visited one such dark store in north-west Delhi.
Inside, goods are stacked neatly on racks - with vegetables in one section, freezer units in another corner, and shelves stuffed with crisps, fizzy drinks and even pet food.
The aisles are so narrow only the workers can weave through them, moving fast and rarely bumping into each other.
The moment an order pops up on the screen, workers jump into action - picking, scanning, and packing items into the trademark brown paper bags with such speed it almost feels robotic.
""Done in under a minute,"" store manager Sagar says proudly.
Delivery riders walk up to the counter, almost in tune with the packers. Packing and pickup happen almost simultaneously - every step planned to reduce the time taken, even by seconds.
Delivery driver Muhammad Faiyaz Alam is 26. He collects a brown bag and agrees to let us join him for the ride.
The destination is 2.2km (1.4 miles) away, about six minutes, according to the digital map.
There are no traffic lights on the route and he drives swiftly through narrow streets.
But the delivery doesn't end when we reach the location pin. In many dense Delhi neighbourhoods, lanes split unexpectedly, buildings look similar and proper addresses are often missing - things digital maps rarely catch.
People usually rely on landmarks instead - like ""near the blue gate"" or ""behind the chemist"" and so on.
Here, the drop‑off is ""near a public bank ATM"", which is not immediately visible.
So Alam calls the customer, follows their directions and eventually spots the right door.
From order to doorstep, the entire process takes 16 minutes. Alam earns 31 rupees (£0.25; $0.30).
He doesn't waste time after delivering the order and quickly heads back to the dark store, where another order is already waiting. The cycle repeats for hours, interrupted only by short food breaks.
The startlingly quick pace is closely tied to how riders are paid.
Alam says he tries to complete around 40 deliveries a day. On a good day, he takes home between 900 and 1,000 rupees, after deducting money spent on fuel and food. But his earnings fluctuate constantly, depending on order volume, distance, and the incentives offered by the app.
He is one of millions working in India's rapidly expanding gig economy, which is expected to employ 23.5 million people by 2030.
Low-paid convenience work is nothing new in India, but what has changed in recent years is the scale. Digital platforms have turned informal deliveries into a vast, app-driven workforce governed by algorithms.
Like most gig workers, Alam is classified as a ""partner"", not an employee.
He gets no fixed salary, no paid leave, and no social security. Although the government has promised labour reforms that could offer basic protections to gig workers, they are yet to be implemented.
Each day, Alam, like many other riders, logs in to the app and books his work slots, also called ""gig slots"".
The idea is simple - the more deliveries riders complete during those windows, the more ""streak"" incentives they unlock, boosting their pay and rewarding longer hours.
In December, Alam says he earned an additional 16,000 rupees through incentives alone. He completed more than 1,000 orders and worked 406 hours that month.
But this setup can unravel quickly for drivers.
Earlier this month, Alam's phone was stolen mid-shift. He had already worked five consecutive days for more than 12 hours and was just two days away from earning another 5,000-rupee incentive. Without his phone, he could not log in and his streak reset instantly.
""I was sad for a few days,"" Alam says. ""But what can I do? At least I got the standard pay.""
This incentive structure is not unique to India, but it is intensified by labour availability and weak worker protections, says Vandana Vasudevan, a researcher and author of OTP Please! Online Buyers, Sellers and Gig Workers.
""These workers are classified as independent contractors, not salaried employees,"" she says. ""They have no social security or benefits, yet algorithms still control their work through ratings, penalties and pay.""
This pressure shows on the roads.
Alam admits he often speeds, squeezes through traffic and sometimes jumps signals to stay on target. Late deliveries can trigger customer complaints or warnings from managers.
Last month, delivery workers in several Indian cities went on strike over falling incomes, unpredictable incentives and unsafe conditions.
It sparked a massive social media debate and the labour ministry ordered platforms to drop aggressive marketing language promising ""10-minute deliveries"".
Experts say the move may not dramatically alter daily conditions for riders, but it does remove the expectation that every order should arrive within a fixed time.
To understand why that pressure exists at all, it helps to look at how quick commerce has grown in Indian cities.
The sector exploded after the pandemic, when lockdowns kept people indoors and crowded markets felt unsafe.
In many Western countries, grocery delivery services such as Getir surged during that period - but once the restrictions eased and people returned to supermarkets - many scaled back or were forced to shut down.
India, however, followed a different trajectory.
""In other countries platforms avoid committing to a fixed 10-minute promise and instead use terms like 'very fast' - thus lowering customer expectations. They also charge a premium for faster delivery, but in India there are no such constraints,"" Vasudevan adds.
Here, you can even order a single avocado - and while it may cost a bit more than buying it from the neighbourhood shop, many urban consumers are willing to pay that premium simply to save time.
That willingness has driven its growth in metropolitan cities, says Ankur Bisen, a partner at retail advisory firm Technopak.
""Quick commerce has tapped into a huge pool of time-poor urban residents who spend long hours commuting and would rather order in essentials than step out again,"" he says.
Despite the buzz, quick commerce remains a small fraction of India's total retail economy and profitability remains elusive.
""They're still losing money,"" Bisen says, adding that these players are yet to come up with a sustainable business model.
Intense competition between Blinkit, Swiggy, Instamart, Zepto and now even Amazon keeps pushing companies to chase customers with ever-shorter delivery promises and heavy discounts in a price-sensitive market.
For users like Singh, quick commerce has shifted from an occasional convenience to a daily habit.
""It's not that I can't live without quick delivery,"" she says. ""But I've grown so used to it that we forget it is a rare privilege and that there is human labour behind it.""
There are signs that awareness is beginning to shift.
A recent survey by community platform LocalCircles found that 74% of respondents supported the government's decision to drop the ""10-minute delivery"" tagline. Nearly 40% said they were willing to wait longer for their groceries, rather than receive them at ultra-fast speed.
Whether that willingness translates into meaningful change on the ground remains uncertain. For now, the speed of India's cities is still being measured in minutes - and carried on the backs of workers who have little choice but to keep moving.

Labour peer who had sanctions lifted by China says it's 'meagre return' for UK,2026-01-30T19:12:17.805Z," Jennifer McKiernan
Political reporter
","A Labour peer against whom sanctions have been lifted by China during Sir Keir Starmer's visit to Beijing says the move is a ""meagre return"" from the trip.
Baroness Helena Kennedy KC was among seven parliamentarians sanctioned by China in 2021 for accusing the country of human rights abuses against the Uyghur minority.
The prime minister announced the sanctions had been lifted after talks with President Xi Jinping.
But Baroness Kennedy said that raising the case of Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai was more important than lifting the sanctions. The media tycoon, a British citizen, was found guilty of colluding with foreign forces under a controversial national security law.
Speaking to the BBC's World Tonight programme, Baroness Kennedy said she was pleased the Labour government had secured concessions where Conservative leaders, including David Cameron and Boris Johnson, had not but said she had hoped for more.
""At least they've gone in there and got something out of this,"" she said, adding: ""I'm not going to have balloons on my door and throw confetti around to celebrate this -- I think it's a meagre return, and I'd like to see Jimmy Lai being released.""
The peer said she had not yet been briefed on what discussions had taken place about the case of Lai but she told the BBC she ""was hoping that we might hear some good news on that front"".
The prime minister has confirmed to the BBC that he did raise the Lai case and the treatment of Uyghurs ""as you would expect"" with President Xi.
The original group of seven to be sanctioned were all vocal critics of China as members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, although former Conservative MP Tim Loughton stood down at the last election.
Baroness Kennedy, a former colleague of Sir Keir Starmer when he was a lawyer, and crossbencher Lord Alton were sanctioned alongside four sitting Conservative MPs - Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Nusrat Ghani, Tom Tugendhat and Neil O'Brien.
They have criticised the ""selective lifting of sanctions"", saying they would ""take no comfort"" in China's decision while Lai remains imprisoned and Uyghurs continue to suffer.
Sir Keir's three-day trip to China - the first by a British prime minister since 2018 - is an attempt to thaw relations and he has argued that the lifting of some sanctions ""vindicated"" his diplomatic approach.
Sir Keir also told the BBC an agreement to halve import taxes on British whisky would come into force on Monday next week, but added that the start date for a deal on visa-free travel for British citizens to China had not yet been agreed.
The UK has confirmed it has not lifted sanctions on any Chinese individuals, but it is not known if restrictions have been lifted on other people sanctioned by China, including Loughton who stood down at the general election in 2024.
Sir Geoffrey Nice KC, chair of the Uyghur Tribunal, which is investigating atrocities against the minority group, was also sanctioned, as was Newcastle University academic Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on the Uyghurs.
Former security minister Tugendhat accused the prime minister of securing too little, despite sanctions on him lifted.
He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that the China deal was ""frankly extraordinary and unbelievably bad, not just for this particular round of diplomatic activity but for Britain's standing in the world"".
He also criticised the ""abasement before going, so allowing the mega embassy and not demanding the release of Jimmy Lai, who as we know is a British citizen in prison in Hong Kong for now more than 1,000 days for the crime of journalism"".
The deal was also criticised by Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse, who says she was ""arbitrarily denied entry"" to Hong Kong to visit her newborn grandson last year. She said a diplomatic reset that ignores ""the existence of secret bans"" is ""not a reset at all"".
Hobhouse, a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, has not officially been sanctioned. She was held at the airport, questioned and sent back to Britain - a decision she believes was taken to silence her.
""We need assurance from the prime minister that all parliamentarians can criticise the actions of the Chinese Communist Party without fear of retribution,"" she said.

"At least 170 killed in air strikes during Myanmar's widely criticised election, UN says",2026-01-30T13:12:25.615Z," Flora Drury
","At least 170 people were killed in military air strikes during Myanmar's weeks' long election period, the United Nations has said.
""Credible sources"" had counted the civilian deaths, the UN rights office said, as well as 408 military aerial attacks from December 2025 to late last week, when the third and final round of voting was held.
The election itself has already been widely denounced as a sham, by numerous countries and human rights groups.
The Union and Solidarity Party (USDP), backed by Myanmar's military, won an overwhelming victory, according to state media - an outcome which was expected following the tightly-controlled vote.
Voting was not possible in large parts of the country, which has been engulfed in civil war sparked by a military coup which saw the democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi ousted and imprisoned in 2021.
Her party, the National League for Democracy, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, was not allowed to contest the vote.
Many believe the military junta will use the vote to maintain its power through proxy political parties.
UN rights chief Volker Turk described the election as ""staged by the military"" in a statement released on Friday.
He pointed out that ""opposition candidates and some ethnic groups were excluded"" from standing in the election, which had its first round on 28 December.
Turk added that people had made decisions ""to vote or not to vote purely out of fear, flatly at odds with their internationally guaranteed civil and political rights"".
Meanwhile, ""the conflict and insecurity continued unabated in large parts of the country"".
James Rodehaver, head of UN Human Rights' Myanmar team, said the figures on civilian deaths in military strikes were drawn from the period between the start of campaigning, in December, to the final voting day in late January.
The figures, which came from open sources, are likely to be currently incomplete ""because of the way in which communications are cut off and... the fear of individuals in some of these locations to speak to us"", he added, according to news agency AFP.

Indonesian couple caned 140 times for sex and alcohol offences,2026-01-30T06:53:22.845Z," Hidayatullah
BBC Indonesian
Aceh
IndonesiaandKoh Ewe
","A couple in Indonesia has been caned 140 times for having sex outside marriage and drinking alcohol because it violates Sharia, or Islamic religious law.
The 21-year-old woman fainted after what authorities said was a record number of strokes to be meted out in a public caning session in the Aceh province.
Three female officers took turns striking her with a rattan cane, while she cried. After she collapsed, she was carried off the stage by female officers to an ambulance.
The couple were caned on Thursday along with four others, including an officer from the Islamic police force, who were all found guilty of violating Sharia.
Caning is a common punishment for breaking Islamic law in religiously conservative Aceh, although the practice has long drawn criticism from rights groups who say it's cruel.
Under Aceh's Islamic criminal code, sex outside marriage is punishable by 100 strokes of the cane, while consuming alcohol carries 40 strokes.
Canings are not regulated properly, says Azharul Husna, the Aceh coordinator for Indonesian rights group Kontras, adding that the rules around such punishments should be ""improved"" to support people after they're caned.
The officer from the Islamic police force was caned 23 times, as was his female partner, for being in close proximity in a private place.
He was caught alone with her in her house, Muhammad Rizal, the head of Aceh's Islamic police force told BBC Indonesian, adding that the officer would be dismissed.
Aceh is the only province in Muslim-majority Indonesia to enforce the Sharia, and punishes many of the offences with public canings.

Vietnam to sell tycoon's Hermès Birkin bags to offset fraud losses,2026-01-30T03:01:07.125Z," Koh Ewe
","Two Birkin bags and a luxury yacht are among the assets belonging to embattled tycoon Truong My Lan that Vietnamese authorities are now trying to sell as part of efforts to offset the billions she embezzled.
The disgraced tycoon is serving a life sentence for embezzling from a major Vietnamese bank and has been ordered to return $27bn (£19bn) in reparations.
Ho Chi Minh City's Civil Judgment Enforcement Agency said this week that it was seeking experts to appraise the value of two crocodile skin Hermès Birkin bags seized from Truong My Lan, local media reported.
Meanwhile her yacht is set to go on auction next month with a starting price of 49.3 billion Vietnamese dong ($1.9m; £1.4m).
Truong My Lan was sentenced to death in April 2024 after a court found that she had secretly controlled Saigon Commercial Bank, the country's fifth biggest lender, and taken out loans and cash over more than 10 years through a web of shell companies, amounting to a total of $44bn.
Prosecutors said $27bn of that sum had been misappropriated, and $12bn was judged to have been embezzled - amounting to one of the largest financial crimes the world had seen.
Truong My Lan denied the charges and tried unsuccessfully to appeal her death sentence - though that was commuted to life in prison last June, after Vietnam abolished the death penalty for a range of crimes.
More than 80 people - including her husband and niece - were tried with her and were all convicted.
Her trial, the most dramatic one in Vietnam's fervent crackdown on corruption, captured the attention of the country and beyond.
The mogul's assets are now at the centre of official efforts to compensate her victims and offset the billions lost to fraud. Authorities have seized more than 1,200 of her assets, including her company holdings and real estate, local media reported.
This week, Ho Chi Minh City Civil Judgment Enforcement Department said it had seized several of Truong My Lan's assets - including the two Hermès bags, clothes and a watch.
During her trial, Truong My Lan had tried to hold on to her two Hermès bags, telling the court that she had bought one of them in Italy and the other was a gift from a Malaysian businessman. She said she wanted to leave the bags as ""keepsakes"" for her children and grandchildren.
But her appeal was rejected by the court, which ruled that the bags were ill-gotten.
Hermès' exclusive Birkin bags can be worth up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Last October, one of Truong My Lan's properties in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City became the first of her assets to be successfully auctioned off, selling for more than 600 billion dong.
Earlier this month, Vietnamese authorities had tried to auction off her Reverie Saigon at 52.4 billion dong - but no one bought the yacht.
It will be up again for auction on 12 February with a reduced starting price, local media reported. Bidders would need to pay a deposit of 20% of the starting price to enter the auction.
Another two of Truong My Lan's boats will also be auctioned at 4.8 billion dong each.

Imran Khan not the only one silenced as Pakistan military stifles dissent,2026-01-29T23:11:02.858Z," Caroline Davies
Pakistan correspondent
","Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan hasn't seen any visitors in more than five weeks, according to his party.
His family say this is partly to stop his words reaching the outside world. They blame the country's military chief, Field Marshall Asim Munir, a charge the government rejects. It says the meetings stopped because Khan broke jail rules prohibiting discussion of politics.
While Khan may be silenced, he's far from the only one under pressure.
Journalists, analysts and human rights advocates say the space to disagree with the state is increasingly limited – and the risks greater.
Last weekend, human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband were convicted of sharing anti-state social media posts.
The couple will spend 10 years in jail.
Ahead of sentencing, Amnesty International had called on Pakistan to end ""coercive tactics used to silence dissent and intimidate those who defend human rights"".
Khan's family are very clear about the effort to wipe him from the public's mind.
""There are two names you can't have on television. You can't say anything nice about Imran Khan, and you can't say anything bad about Asim Munir,"" his sister Aleema Khanum told the BBC. She was speaking at a recent protest by supporters a few kilometres from his cell in Rawalpindi's Adiala jail.
It's been more than eight weeks since Khan saw a family member, more than five since he met a lawyer and then it was only for eight minutes, his party says.
""This is the only way we have right now to create enough pressure that we are allowed to meet him,"" Khanum said at the protest. ""It's his right to meet his lawyers, it's his right to meet his family, it's his communication with the outside world.""
That communication from Khan has often been highly critical of Pakistan's government and military chief. After meetings inside the jail, Khan's words have often been posted on his X account, attributed to him and giving directions to his party and supporters.
""They are unable to block his voice because people want to hear him, they read his messages, they are not giving up on him,"" Khanum says.
But for now, with meetings stopped, so have those messages.
Khan, imprisoned since August 2023, is convicted in several corruption cases which he says are politically motivated.
The government and military reject claims he is being held in isolation. Talal Chaudhry, an interior minister, has called him ""the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan"", with gym equipment and a cook.
After a post appeared quoting Khan on his X account, calling Munir a ""mentally unstable person"", the military spokesperson held a two-hour news conference broadcast across Pakistan's media, saying Khan had gone beyond politics and labelled him a national security threat.
""One could argue that the military is really leading the country on so many levels now that Pakistan's coming quite close to authoritarian rule,"" says Michael Kugelman, senior fellow on South Asia at the Atlantic Council.
""This is the worst the repression has been during any period of civilian rule.""
Pakistan's military, often referred to as ""the establishment"", have been an ever-present factor in the country politics, including periods of military dictatorship.
Initially, Khan and the military appeared close; many believe their backing helped bring Khan to power and the opposition at the time initially accused him of being in thrall to the military while he governed. Khan's party denied this.
By the time he was ousted in a vote of no confidence in 2022, Khan had not only fallen out with the military leadership, but blamed them for his removal from power.
In November 2025, a constitutional amendment granted Munir lifetime immunity from prosecution and oversight of all Pakistan's defence forces.
Many saw it as a further sign that the military's influence over Pakistan was at a high-water mark under a civilian government.
The current government deny the military are calling the shots.
""The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,"" Chaudhry says, adding the chief of defence forces ""is doing a marvellous job"".
Security sources said: ""The military has always maintained it operates within legal bounds.""
But Michael Kugelman and others see a connection between the military's involvement in politics and the amount of space to speak out.
""It's intrinsically linked to how strong or weak a democratic government is and what their relationship is with the military,"" says Munizae Jahangir, a journalist and co-chair for the Human Rights Council of Pakistan (HRCP).
""If the military is more dominant, there will be less space for protest, there will be less space for dissent, there will be less space for free expression.""
Of those already jailed, Mazari is among the most prominent. A lawyer who has worked on some of the most sensitive cases in Pakistan, she and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha were convicted of ""disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups"".
The government have defended their sentencing; in response Pakistan's information minister posted on X: ""As you sow, so you shall reap!""
""Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,"" Chaudhry said.
Other human rights advocates told the BBC they have faced limits on how they can operate.
HRCP say that their staff have been harassed on phone calls and stopped from holding round-table discussions at hotels unless they obtain permission in advance. The government says this is ""to ensure security"".
Journalists, too, say they have felt pressure. In 2023, the BBC reported that TV channels had been told that they must not show Khan's face, his voice or say his name. The topics that should not be covered, according to journalists the BBC spoke to, have expanded.
""They [Pakistan's authorities] have controlled the mainstream media to a large extent,"" said Azaz Syed, a reporter for Geo TV. He says that even stories tangentially linked to the military – including one he recently did on a defence housing authority – have led to phone calls from unknown numbers with warnings to go no further.
Jahangir says she has even been told by editors not to cover certain stories.
""The editors are not doing this for fun. They do fundamentally believe in freedom of expression. They are doing this in order to survive,"" she says.
Journalists from other outlets who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity said that a culture of self-censorship was now common in newsrooms.
""There were times in the past when there was complete censorship,"" one said. ""Now there is self-censorship, which in many ways is worse because we are deceiving the audience.""
The BBC approached the military for comment.
Security sources told us that ISPR, the military's communications arm, ""does not regulate media content, freedom of speech, or interfere in civilian journalism, nor does it exercise any authority over public discourse beyond its lawful communication role"".
Dawn newspaper - the oldest in Pakistan, founded in 1941 by the country's founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah - has taken a financial hit for its reporting. In December, Dawn Media Group said it had been subject to an unannounced ban on government adverts, firstly on its newspaper, then on its TV and radio outlets, a move the Council of Newspaper Editors said was ""financially crippling the organisation"".
""While some within the state may think that punishing outlets that refuse to toe the line may snuff out critical voices, in the modern age this is next to impossible,"" the editorial board said.
Information minister Atta Tarar denied that Dawn was denied government advertisement.
Several journalists said that the changes to Pakistan's Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act in early 2025 have made the environment more difficult.
Pakistan's authorities introduced the changes, saying they were needed to fight what the military has often termed ""digital terrorism""; spreading what they see to be ""anarchy and false information"" to undermine the state. The country's constitution protects the right to freedom of speech and expression subject to reasonable restrictions, security sources told the BBC.
""It's false to claim Pakistan suppresses free speech,"" says Chaudhry. He cites the dangers of social media being used for financial fraud and recruiting terrorists. ""We want to regulate social media, the whole world is regulating [it].""
But others say they can be used to limit journalists' ability to report.
""Changes made to the law have now made it an explicit crime to criticise the security establishment, the judiciary and definitions around national interest have been made even more vague. There are astonishingly steep fines and the penalties have been enhanced disproportionately,"" says Adnan Rehmat, a media analyst based in Islamabad.
He says there are the official rules, then there are further unspoken rules: ""It's really difficult to know what the boundaries are, they are forever shifting.""
Limitations on journalists are not new in Pakistan. Under Khan's government, journalists protested about restrictions placed on what they could publish and broadcast.
Syed sees the current situation as a continuation of the operation against the media. Jahangir also sees some level of historical continuity. ""I can't say this has been the worst time, but let's say that times haven't improved for us.""
While attempts to limit and intimidate critics have happened before, some think there is a new approach this time.
""It feels like something has shifted,"" says Azeema Cheema, an Islamabad-based research director specialising in conflict, fragility and violence. ""Because now you are using the courts. You are using institutions, not extra institutional measures.""
Those operating online outside Pakistan are in the authorities' sights too. In early January, seven Pakistani journalists and Youtubers, including two former army officers, were tried in absentia and given life sentences for digital terrorism. The prosecution accused them of ""waging war against state"" and ""incitement"" in relation to protests that took place on 9 May 2023 after Khan's first arrest.
In a post on X, one of the sentenced, Adil Raja, said ""speaking truth to power is now called Digital Terrorism in Pakistan"".
Syed and Cheema cite this case as a particularly stark example of harsh sentencing.
""There's been a growing realisation that the state is excessively willing and unapologetically willing to wield a blunt hammer,"" says Cheema.
Where that hammer may fall next is what many we spoke to are trying to calculate.

Why China moved so quickly to execute 11 members of a notorious mafia family,2026-01-29T23:00:25.617Z," Jonathan Head
South East Asia correspondent
","No-one should be surprised that China has swiftly executed the 11 members of an organised crime family from north-eastern Myanmar who were sentenced to death in September.
China executes more people than anywhere else in the world, according to human rights groups – the exact figure is a state secret. Officials are often executed for corruption. The accusations made against the Ming family were far more serious.
The Ming, Bau, Wei and Liu clans have dominated the remote border town of Laukkaing in Myanmar's impoverished Shan state, since 2009.
They rose to power after General Min Aung Hlaing, the current coup leader in Myanmar, led a military operation to drive out the MNDAA, the ethnic insurgent army which had dominated Laukkaing and the area around it since the 1980s.
The four families, as they became known, took over and began shifting from the old dependence on opium and methamphetamine production to a new economy based on casinos and, eventually, online fraud.
They remained close to the Myanmar military; in December 2021, after seizing power in his coup, Min Aung Hlaing feted Liu Zhengxiang, patriarch of the Liu clan, in the capital Nay Pyi Taw and awarded him an honorary title for ""extraordinary contributions to state development"".
His Fully Light conglomerate had lucrative businesses all over Myanmar. Other members of the four families were candidates for the military-backed party the USDP.
The scam compounds they ran in Laukkaing, though, were brutal, much more so than scam complexes in other parts of Asia. Torture was routine.
Tens of thousands of mainly Chinese workers were lured there with promises of well-paid jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned in the compounds. They were forced to run elaborate ""pig-butchering"" scams, where most of the victims were also Chinese. Complaints from the victims, and by the families of those trapped in the compounds multiplied on social media.
The most notorious compound in Laukkaing was called Crouching Tiger Villa, run by the Ming family. In October 2023, during what is believed to have been an escape attempt, the guards killed several Chinese nationals. The Chinese authorities felt compelled to take action.
With China's apparent blessing the MNDAA and its allies attacked and recaptured Laukkaing, as part of their offensive against the Myanmar army in the ongoing civil war. The MNDAA vowed to stamp out the scam business completely.
They detained the heads of the four families and handed more than 60 of their relatives and associates to the Chinese police. Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, or warlord, killed himself after being captured, authorities said.
During interrogations by the Chinese police one of the family members is reported to have admitted killing someone chosen at random just to demonstrate his strength.
These details have been publicised by China to justify its tough treatment of the families. Five of the Bau family are also awaiting execution, while the trials of the Wei and Liu families have not yet concluded.
The four families are ethnic Chinese, and had close ties to the authorities on the Chinese side of the border in Yunnan. Their abuses were too close to home for China, and the action against the scam business in Laukkaing has been the most decisive yet.
China has also prevailed on Thailand and Cambodia to extradite two Chinese business figures accused of running scam empires, She Zhijiang, who built an entire city in Myanmar's war-torn Karen State, and Chen Zhi, who amassed wealth and power with his Prince Group conglomerate in Cambodia. The Chinese government has also brought tens of thousands of its citizens who were working in scam compounds back to China to face trial.
The scam business, though, has simply adapted and evolved. It is still thought to be by far the biggest business in Cambodia, despite pressure from China and the US on the government there to shut it down.
And it has kept moving to new areas in Myanmar, even as the more prominent scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the Thai-Myanmar border, have been forced to close down.

Big challenges lurk behind India's world-beating growth,2026-01-29T22:26:38.979Z," Nikhil Inamdar
Mumbai
","As India's Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, gets ready to present the annual budget this Sunday, the country's economy, on the face of it, appears to be doing well.
India is on track to end the financial year with growth of 7.3%, cross $4tn (£2.97tn) in gross domestic product (GDP) and overtake Japan as Asia's second-largest economy.
Retail inflation is below 2% and expected to remain under the central bank's target in the coming months. Agriculture output, which supports about half the population, has been strong, cereal production is robust and government granaries are well stocked - boosting rural incomes.
Last year's income tax cuts and the rationalisation of the goods and services tax (GST) - a levy on consumption - have also lifted consumer demand and stimulated spending. India's central bank, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has described this combination of high growth and low inflation as a ""Goldilocks"" phase - a term coined by US economist David Shulman to describe an economy expanding at just the right pace, with good jobs growth.
But the strong headline numbers conceal some of the deeper challenges.
The government says unemployment is falling, yet demand for unstable gig work remains high. India's five largest IT companies - which for decades created tens of thousands of jobs every quarter - added a net total of just 17 employees in the first nine months of 2025. These are tell-tale signs of labour market weakness.
The hiring freeze in the software sector, which birthed India's middle class from the 1990s, highlights the growing disruption caused by AI in the country's vast back-office economy.
The slowdown in white-collar hiring accompanies the continuing crisis at India's labour-intensive exports units.
India has entered 2026 with the looming shadow of Trump's 50% tariffs – a deadlock that's lasted far longer than expected. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has displayed great expediency for trade diversification by inking a string of free trade deals or FTAs - most recently with the European Union this week – the drag on exports has begun to show.
""Exports to the US weakened sequentially since the implementation of the 50% US tariff, while to the rest of the world it has picked up only marginally,"" according to HSBC Research.
FTAs will help in the longer run, but whether India can compete with countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh in selling to non-US geographies would depend on many other things like quality, price and scale, say analysts.
While tariffs have dominated trade debates, economists continue to worry about another long-term trend India has struggled to reverse despite rapid growth: weak private investment.
JP Morgan's Jehangir Aziz recently told How India's Economy Works podcast that corporate investment had ""flatlined since 2012"" and remained at around 12% of GDP. ""The question that the government isn't asking is: how come for 13 straight years, corporate India has not invested?"" he said.
According to Aziz, fresh investments have stalled because factories continue to have excess capacity since demand isn't strong enough, which is preventing new capacity from coming up.
This, combined with other trends such as foreign investors pulling money out of India, is a sign that high reported GDP growth masks underlying weaknesses, says Ruchir Sharma, chair of Rockefeller International.
""India has long attracted only modest capital from abroad, thanks in large measure to the lingering 'Licence Raj', which can make it prohibitively expensive to acquire land or hire and fire workers,"" Sharma wrote in a recent piece for the Financial Times.
""Asian economies that have sustained rapid growth - such as China and Vietnam more recently - saw net foreign direct investment surge above 4% of GDP during their boom phases. That figure never surpassed 1.5% in India, and it is now just 0.1%.""
To be fair, the government recently updated its labour codes which, it says, will ease up the climate of doing business. Whether that's enough to draw foreign capital back, however, remains an open question.
Against this backdrop, the finance minister is likely to emphasise on two key pillars in the budget: more reforms and fiscal restraint, according to HSBC Research.
""Potential focus areas could include expanding the production-linked incentive scheme [incentives designed to boost domestic manufacturing] and support for MSMEs [medium and small sized enterprises] and exporters,"" according to Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi, analysts at Japan's Nomura.
There could also be larger capital outlays for defence and a lowering of customs duty slabs as India tries to push exports.
The Modi government has spent more than $100bn annually on building new infrastructure like roads, railways and telecom equipment in the last four years. That trend is likely to continue – with capital expenditure expected to remain stable at 3% of GDP, according to ICICI Bank Global Markets.
But given last year's budget focused on easing pressures on the middle class - with income tax and GST cuts amounting to about 0.9% of GDP - the government's tax shortfalls are expected to widen.
As a result the thrust will be on ensuring that the deficit is brought down, or at least maintained.
""While fiscal expansion is unlikely, we forecast the finance minister would refrain from further consolidation,"" Nuvama Securities said in a note.
""A big stimulus is unlikely as the exchequer remains committed to reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio by 1% annually until FY31 [financial year 2030-31], implying a continued focus on deleveraging.""

China executes 11 members of Myanmar scam mafia,2026-01-29T06:30:35.350Z," Koh EweandJonathan Head
South East Asia correspondent in Bangkok
","China has executed 11 members of a notorious mafia family that ran scam centres in Myanmar along its north-eastern border, state media report.
The Ming family members were sentenced in September for various crimes including homicide, illegal detention, fraud and operating gambling dens by a court in China's Zhejiang province.
The Mings were one of many clans that ran the town of Laukkaing, transforming an impoverished backwater town into a flashy hub of casinos and red-light districts.
Their scam empire came crashing down in 2023, when they were detained and handed over to China by ethnic militias that had taken control of Laukkaing during an escalation in their conflict with Myanmar's army.
With these executions Beijing is sending a message of deterrence to would-be scammers. But the business has now moved to Myanmar's border with Thailand, and to Cambodia and Laos, where China has much less influence.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia, according to estimates by the UN. Among them are thousands of Chinese people, and their victims who they swindle billions of dollars from are mainly Chinese too.
Frustrated by the Myanmar military's refusal to stop the scam business, from which it was almost certainly profiting, Beijing tacitly backed an offensive by an ethnic insurgent alliance in Shan State in late 2023. The alliance captured significant territory from the military and overran Laukkaing, a key border town.

The eleven members of the Ming family are the first of the Myanmar scam bosses to be executed by China.
But they will not be the last. Five members of the Bai family were also sentenced to death in November, and the trials of two other groups of defendants from the Wei and the Liu families have not yet concluded.
The Ming family's trial was held behind closed doors, although more than 160 people were allowed to attend their sentencing hearing last year, including families of victims.
The Ming mafia's scam operations and gambling dens brought in more than 10bn yuan ($1.4bn; £1bn) between 2015 and 2023, according to China's highest court, which rejected their appeals in November. Their crimes resulted in the deaths of 14 Chinese citizens and injuries to many others, the court said.
More than 20 others from the Ming family were given jail sentences in September ranging from five years to life. Ming Xuechang, the clan's patriarch, killed himself in 2023 while trying to avoid detention, Myanmar's military had said back then.
The confessions of those who were arrested were aired in state media documentaries, to emphasise Chinese authorities' resolve to eradicate scam networks.
The Mings were among a handful of Godfather-esque families who rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s. This was after the town's then warlord was ousted in a military operation led by Min Aung Hlaing, who became the leader of Myanmar's military government after the 2021 coup.
The head of the family, Ming Xuechang, ran one of the most infamous of Laukkaing's scam centres, Crouching Tiger Villa.
At first gambling and prostitution were the main sources of income for these families, but they eventually started online fraud, staffed mostly by people who were kidnapped and forced to run these scams.
Within the walls of the sprawling, well-guarded compounds was a culture of violence. Beatings and torture were routine, according to testimonies collected from freed workers.

Man who exposed human rights abuses in China granted US asylum,2026-01-29T03:27:50.216Z," Gavin Butler
","A Chinese national who exposed human rights abuses in Xinjiang has been granted asylum in the United States, after an immigration judge found he had a ""well founded fear"" of persecution if he returned to China.
In 2020, Guan Heng secretly filmed detention facilitates in the north-western Chinese region, where human rights groups say more than one million ethnic Uyghurs have been detained against their will.
Guan, 38, applied for asylum after arriving in the US illegally in 2021, but was detained in August as part of a mass deportation campaign by the Trump administration.
Plans to deport him to Uganda were dropped in December after his situation raised public concerns.
When asked during Wednesday's hearing if his plan in filming the detention facilities and releasing the video a few days before his arrival in the US was to give himself grounds for an asylum claim, Guan said it was not.
""I sympathised with the Uyghurs who were persecuted,"" he replied, via video link from the US correctional facility where he was being held.
Guan published most of the footage on YouTube after leaving China, having first travelled to Hong Kong and then Ecuador, the Bahamas, and eventually Florida.
The videos show him travelling to parts of Xinjiang and filming what he describes as ""concentration camps"".
Several countries, including the US, UK, Canada and the Netherlands, have accused China of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur Muslim population in Xinjiang.
A UN human rights committee in 2018 said it had credible reports that China was holding up to a million people in ""counter-extremism centres"" in the region, which is largely cut off to international media and observers.
China denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and describes the centres as ""re-education camps"" to prevent terrorism and root out Islamist extremism.
Meanwhile, Uyghurs in exile continue to recount stories of terrified or disappeared relatives.
A series of police files obtained by the BBC in 2022 revealed details of China's use of these camps and described the routine use of armed officers and the existence of a shoot-to-kill policy for those trying to escape.
People who have managed to escape the camps have reported physical, mental and sexual torture. Women have spoken of mass rape and sexual abuse.
Guan's lawyer, Chen Chuangchuang, said his client's case was a ""textbook example of why asylum should exist"".
The US has a ""moral and legal responsibility"" to grant Guan asylum, he added.
The judge on Wednesday said Guan was right to fear retaliation from the Chinese state if sent back, noting that his family had already been questioned, and said he had established his legal eligibility for asylum.
The Department of Homeland Security reserves the right to appeal and has 30 days to do so.

Indians pay tribute after Arijit Singh retires at 38 as Bollywood singer,2026-01-29T01:54:47.665Z," Zoya Mateen
BBC News
","Heartbroken fans of renowned Indian singer Arijit Singh have been paying tribute to him after he announced he would no longer take on new playback assignments, marking the end of a defining chapter in contemporary Bollywood music.
Some described his voice as ""the sound of our heartbreaks and celebrations"", while others called it ""a presence in every corner of our lives"".
In Indian cinema, playback singing refers to studio recordings of songs that actors lip‑sync on screen - a bedrock of Bollywood storytelling.
Singh's voice became inseparable from that tradition, providing vocals for romantic ballads and chart‑topping soundtracks in recent years.
The 38-year-old, who has collaborated with global pop icons like Ed Sheeran, made his announcement on Instagram on Tuesday.
""I am calling it off. It was a wonderful journey,"" he said.
Fans then flooded social media with posts reflecting on how his songs, which consistently topped the charts, had become part of India's cultural soundtrack.
Singh did not explain why he was quitting playback singing, but reports say he will finish existing commitments and projects and continue making music independently, exploring creative projects beyond commercial cinema.
The decision is unusually bold for a singer at the peak of his career.
Singh recently performed to a sold-out crowd at Wembley Arena in London, a milestone few Indian playback singers achieve. His voice - bruised, buttery and intimate - has been an inescapable undercurrent of Bollywood, narrating heartbreaks, longings and reconciliations for millions for more than a decade.
Yet, even at the height of fame, he chooses to remain on the margins of celebrity culture, visibly ambivalent about his own success.
He rarely gives interviews, avoids publicity stunts and appears in public dressed like someone you might miss entirely: soft-spoken, his face concealed in a hoodie. ""I hate being a celebrity,"" he told Forbes India in an early interview, describing himself as someone who stumbled into fame by accident.
Singh was born in 1987 in Jiagang, a small town in West Bengal state, into a household where music was not an aspiration but a daily practice, permeating every aspect of life.
His mother and grandmother were trained classical singers and his aunt also taught music. Classical training came early - he learnt tabla alongside vocal training - but so did exposure to popular music.
Singh's first teacher, Birendra Prasad Hazari, recalled him as a toddler at the local music school, eyes fixed on the harmonium before he could even pronounce the notes. Hazari told the Indian newspaper The Telegraph he had ""never come across a singer as talented"", noting the boy's rapid progression from early raga lessons to the voice the world would later know.
Singh's first brush with national attention came in 2005 when he appeared on the reality singing show, Fame Gurukul (Fame Academy). He did not win and his presence barely registered. But the setback, in some ways, proved formative.
Singh returned to Kolkata city in West Bengal, where he worked as a music programmer and assistant, learning studio work. For several years, he existed on the margins of the industry he would later dominate.
When recognition finally arrived, it did so with unusual force. In 2013, Singh sang Tum Hi Ho for the film, Aashiqui 2. The song released at a time when Bollywood's romantic music leaned toward scale and spectacle. Singh's voice - inward and raw - had the opposite effect, reintroducing vulnerability to Bollywood audiences as an acceptable emotion.
The song became so popular it outgrew the film to become a national obsession. It was everywhere, flooding radio, weddings and reality shows, the slowbuild, aching notes articulating romantic devotion that felt cinematic yet intensely personal. For months, it felt difficult to move through cities and towns without encountering it.
What followed was a period of extraordinary success. Overnight, Singh became Bollywood's most relateable voice, recording across many languages - Hindi, Bengali, Tamil and Telugu - and sometimes singing multiple songs in a single film. He collaborated repeatedly with leading composers including Pritam, AR Rahman, Vishal–Shekhar and Amit Trivedi.
Singh appeared uncomfortable with the fame that followed and shunned media attention, often skipping award ceremonies.
On stage too he remained informal. At concerts, he chats with the audience, takes requests, sometimes stopping mid-song to adjust the arrangement, or to scold his fans for spending too much time recording, instead of being present.
In his personal life, Singh works with a small team and has chosen to base himself primarily in his hometown - where he's routinely seen slipping out on a scooter to pick up groceries or catching up with old friends - over the glamour of big cities. International visitors, including Dutch DJ Martin Garrix and Sheeran, have reportedly visited his Jiaganj residence.
In recent years, his output has also become more selective, with him choosing to focus more on independent projects.
There was also criticism: some listeners and critics have argued that many of his songs started to sound alike, with his trademark husky, introspective delivery creating a sense of sameness across different films and genres.
In a 2017 interview, Singh admitted he was trying to cut down on projects because he found it ""uncomfortable"" to hear his songs playing everywhere.
""Of course people will be exhausted if you continue to sing 100 songs a year,"" he said.
Fans are now wondering what comes next.
Some interpret this week's announcement as the natural evolution of an artist who finds fame stifling. Others see it as a statement on the pressures of commercial music, or simply the next step in his journey of self-exploration.
Whatever the reason, his voice will keep defining music in India.

China suspends Irish beef imports two weeks after resuming,2026-01-28T19:12:51.816Z," Louise Cullen
Agriculture and environment correspondent
BBC News NI
","China has suspended imports of beef from the Republic of Ireland just two weeks after the market reopened.
The new ban is due to Bluetongue Virus (BTV), cases of which have now been detected in four herds in County Wexford.
Beef exports from the Republic of Ireland to China were previously suspended in 2024 after an atypical case of Bovine Spongiform Encelopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease, was found in a cow.
Under a protocol agreed with China, beef exports have to be suspended when any BSE case is discovered.
Bluetongue poses no risk to human health.
Transmitted by biting midges, due to the cold weather any infection is unlikely to spread widely.
Despite this, the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) said active surveillance and tracing are continuing.
It is understood that DAFM informed the Chinese authorities of the outbreak of BTV, under the rules of their export agreement.
In Northern Ireland, a suspected case of the virus is under investigation in Portavogie in County down, within the existing Temporary Control Zone (TCZ) that has been in place since November 2025.
There are additional requirements for moving these high-risk animals within and out of the TCZ.
A limited financial support scheme is in place for affected farmers.
A vaccine was approved in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland last year.
Bluetongue virus (BTV-3) affects cattle, goats, sheep, deer and camelids such as llamas and alpacas.
It can cause ulcers or sores around the animal's mouth and face, difficulties swallowing and breathing, fever and lameness, foetal deformities and stillbirths.
The latest outbreak began in the Netherlands in 2023, where tens of thousands of sheep died, and midges blown over from the continent began infecting livestock in the south-east of England too.
But the impact of BTV-3 seems to vary considerably across different regions, with some animals showing little sign of infection and managing to recover.

The politician whose death leaves a vacuum in India's richest state,2026-01-28T13:38:31.278Z," Zoya Mateen
Mumbai
","The sudden death of an influential leader has left a political vacuum in India's richest state.
Ajit Pawar, the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, died on Wednesday in a plane crash along with four others.
Maharashtra's political landscape is notoriously complex - a web of shifting alliances, regional loyalties and rivalries. And for decades, Ajit Pawar navigated it with a mixture of pragmatism and shrewdness, swiftly rising through the ranks.
Yet, beneath the public triumphs, his journey was also deeply personal: a struggle to emerge out of the formidable shadow of his uncle Sharad Pawar - the founder of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and a dominant figure in Indian politics.
Born in 1959, Ajit Pawar entered politics in the 1980s under his uncle's mentorship, particularly focusing on the Pawar family stronghold of Baramati, a rural area in western Maharashtra where sugar cooperatives, banks and local institutions helped secure both economic influence and political loyalty.
From an early age, Ajit Pawar was seen as the uncle's visible heir. But he was determined to forge his own path.
To many, Sharad Pawar represented old-school authority: patient and strategic, he was known for his coalition-building skills and political instincts. Ajit Pawar, on the other hand, focused on regional power, governance and control over local political networks.
His style was also markedly different. Where Sharad Pawar spoke in measured tones, Ajit Pawar was blunt and practical, his mercurial personality earning him both loyal supporters and vocal critics.
But as his authority grew, so did his frustration. Ajit Pawar had risen quickly through the ranks of NCP, yet he was often seen as a lieutenant rather than a leader. Decisions were still made by the elder Pawar.
The tensions simmered for years before erupting in public. In 2019, Ajit Pawar shocked Maharashtra by briefly breaking ranks with his uncle and aligning with the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form the government and claim the deputy chief minister's post.
His effort to strike out by himself collapsed within days, undone by Sharad Pawar who intervened to reclaim control of the party and help his allies form the government
But for the first time, the family rift was out in the open. Ajit Pawar returned to the party, but the breach never fully healed.
Things finally came to head four years later in 2023, when Ajit Pawar broke away from his uncle's NCP party, joined a new governing coalition led by the BJP and claimed the post of the deputy chief minister once again. This time, he also managed to split his uncle's party and claim the name and electoral symbol of NCP as his own.
From then, family gatherings dwindled, public appearances were mostly separate, and the Pawar name, once seen as a single axis of power, fractured into two rival camps.
For Ajit Pawar's supporters, the defection was long overdue and a courageous step, reflecting his ability to adapt in India's political system, where even bitter ideological opponents might join hands to come to power. To critics, he symbolised opportunistic politics.
The rupture has since become one of the most remarked-upon political dramas in Maharashtra, one that transformed its fault lines.
In recent days, after civic elections in Pune and Mumbai, conversations had begun about the possibility of a reconciliation between the two factions of the NCP, led by uncle and nephew. Some speculated that Ajit Pawar might even emerge as the leader of a united party.
His sudden death has brought those possibilities to an abrupt halt. Questions now swirl about whether the lawmakers who had left with him will accept the authority of his cousin, Supriya Sule - Sharad Pawar's daughter - or his wife or son, and whether the fragile alliances he nurtured can endure.
Ajit Pawar leaves behind him a divided political legacy - and a reminder of how personal ambitions and familial ties can shape politics in the most surprising ways.

Grief and shock after Indian politician Ajit Pawar killed in plane crash,2026-01-28T12:16:42.032Z," Cherylann Mollan
Mumbai
","India's prime minister has led tributes to Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister of Maharashtra state, who has been killed in a plane crash in the west of the country.
Pawar and four others died after the chartered plane they were travelling in crashed at the airport in Baramati - Pawar's constituency - on Wednesday morning.
India's civil aviation minister said visibility was poor at the airport at the time of the crash. The aviation regulator has launched an investigation.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Pawar's death ""shocking and saddening"" and praised his service to the people of Maharashtra. His funeral will be held on Thursday morning.
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis described his death as ""an immeasurable loss"" and announced three days of mourning in the state.
Pawar was one of Maharashtra's most influential leaders, governing in coalition with India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The 66-year-old was affectionately called 'dada', a term for elder brother in the Marathi language, by party workers and the public.
Sanjay Raut, from the state's opposition Shiv Sena (UBT) party, said Pawar's death was a ""dark day"".
""Without Dada, the political landscape of Maharashtra is incomplete. He had an open-hearted personality and every party worker admired him,"" he said.
Federal Home Minister Amit Shah, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and others have also paid tribute.
Ajit Pawar was a towering figure in Maharashtra's politics.
For decades, he was a key member of the Nationalist Congress Party founded by his uncle, veteran politician Sharad Pawar.
In his early years in politics, he focused on the grassroots and built networks with workers' unions and local co-operative banks.
He was elected to the Maharashtra legislative assembly from Baramati for the first time in 1991 and would be re-elected from the same constituency several times, reflecting his strong connection with voters.
Pawar also served as the state's deputy chief minister many times and headed key ministries within different governments, including agriculture and finance.
But his last couple of years in politics were marked by turbulence and rebellion as he sought to move away from the shadow of his uncle and pursue his own political ambitions.
Obituary: The politician whose death leaves a vacuum in India's richest state
In 2019, he made a dramatic move by breaking away from the NCP to join the state's ruling BJP government as the deputy chief minister. But lacking support from the NCP's cadre, the alliance collapsed and Pawar returned to his party within days.
He was made deputy chief minister again when the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena joined hands to form the government and played a key role in the coalition for the next three years.
But tensions within the NCP continued to rise and in 2023, Pawar once again split from the party, this time with a large group of legislators, causing the NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena alliance to collapse. India's Election Commission would later recognise his faction as the official NCP.
Pawar then helped form the state's new tri-party coalition government led by the BJP.
He continued to serve as deputy chief minister but shared the post with another politician.
In recent months, there were reports about a possible reconciliation between uncle and nephew, but neither of them officially confirmed this.

Pawar was reportedly travelling to Baramati to address public meetings related to upcoming local elections when his plane crashed.
India's aviation regulator has said that the aircraft he was travelling on was a Bombardier Learjet 45, which is a small business jet commonly used for charter flights and VIP travel in India.
Pawar was accompanied by two staff members and two crew members who also died in the crash.
""The aircraft was cleared for landing in Baramati on Wednesday morning after multiple attempts but, having finally received landing clearance, it did not give any ""read-back"" or response to the Air Traffic Control and moments later burst into flames on the edge of the runway"", the federal aviation ministry said in a statement.

Pawar's death will leave a vacuum in his party and also in Maharashtra's political landscape.
He enjoyed huge support from his party members and was also loved by the public.
Pawar was regarded as a shrewd administrator and skilled orator, and his witty remarks and fiery speeches made headlines and landed him in controversies many times.
Over his decades-long career, he was accused of corruption, but he always denied the allegations against him.
In the past decade or so, he had chartered a new trajectory for the NCP by embarking on surprising political alliances and managing to stay in power despite it taking a toll on his family.
It's unclear who, or if anyone at all, will be able to fill Pawar's shoes in the NCP.
Pawar's death will also have ramifications for the ruling alliance in Maharashtra as his party is left without its strongest leader.
While the BJP-led ruling coalition has the numbers to run the government even without all of Ajit Pawar's lawmakers, any defection could lead to even more turbulence in Maharashtra's political landscape.

Bondi Beach shooting accused faces court for the first time,2026-02-16T07:53:10.447Z," Gavin Butler
","Accused Bondi Beach gunman Naveed Akram faced court for the first time on Monday, two months after he and his father allegedly carried out Australia's worst mass shooting in almost 30 years.
The 24-year-old appeared in a Sydney court for about five minutes via video link from prison. He faces 59 charges relating to the Bondi Beach shooting, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist attack.
Naveed and his father, Sajid, allegedly attacked a Hanukkah event at the famous beach on 14 December, killing 15 people and injuring more than 40.
Sajid, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene, while Naveed was critically injured and later transferred from hospital to prison.
Monday was the first time Akram had been seen on screen and spoken since his arrest – saying just one word when Deputy Chief Magistrate Sharon Freund asked if he heard a discussion about an extension of suppression orders: ""Yeah"".
The court orders cover the identities of those who survived the shooting, but allow the survivors to self-identify if they wish.
Outside court, Akram's lawyer, Ben Archbold, said it was too early to say what plea his client would enter, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
He said Akram was doing ""as well as can be expected"" while in custody in Goulburn supermax prison.
""Everyone knows it's supermax … very onerous conditions,"" Archbold told journalists.
When asked if Akram had given a police interview, he said ""All we've done is start the process. We're waiting for the brief to be served. There's nothing more I can say.""
Court documents released in late December alleged that the two shooters ""meticulously"" planned the attack on Bondi Beach for months and visited the location for reconnaissance two days prior.
One video - taken on one of their mobile phones in October - was described as showing the men sitting in front of an image of an Islamic State group (IS) flag.
They could be heard making statements about their motivations for the attack and condemning ""the acts of 'Zionists'"", police said.
Police said separate footage from October showed the father and son ""conducting firearms training in a countryside location"", believed to be in New South Wales.
They were seen ""firing shotguns and moving in a tactical manner"", officials added.
Authorities earlier confirmed that two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl were among the victims of the Bondi Beach attack.
Akram is next due in court in April.

","Sydney police have appealed for the return of an 85-year-old whom they believe was kidnapped by mistake.
Chris Baghsarian, who lived alone, was taken from his house in the suburb of North Ryde by at least three attackers early on Friday morning, and bundled into a dark-coloured SUV.
""They were intending to take somebody, but have taken the wrong person,"" Det Acting Supt Andrew Marks told reporters on Monday, adding that no ransom note had been received.
""The family are in distress. All they want is their father to be returned, their grandfather to be returned,"" he said, appealing for people to report any unusual activity seen around properties known to be empty.
The appeal came as the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) reported that videos and images of a severely injured Baghsarian in an unknown location were circulating in Sydney's underworld.
""It's not ideal that those images are out there,"" Marks said, noting that Baghsarian needed daily medication and that ""every hour is very important"".
""I have seen the videos,"" he add. ""They are distressing to see an 85-year-old man in that condition.""
He said that in a ""normal"" kidnapping case, ""we would be aware of a ransom"".
""But because the family are not involved in this type of crime, and they're not involved in that world, they haven't received a ransom.""
Cases of mistaken identity have become increasingly common in Sydney's underworld, the SMH reported, as large organised crime networks increasingly subcontract crimes.
Last year a 23-year-old plumber was shot dead in his driveway in Condell Park in what police believe was also a case of mistaken identity.
He was ""a million per cent confident they have the wrong person,"" Marks said but would not elaborate on who police thought the intended target was.
""The fact that these offenders – these kidnappers – have got it so wrong is concerning.""
CCTV footage published by local media showed an SUV driving up outside Baghsarian's home on Friday. Two hooded figures then approach the house before reappearing with someone who is struggling in their arms and then loaded into the SUV.
A burnt out vehicle matching the description of the getaway car was found in the nearby suburb of South Turramurra shortly afterwards.
Police said Baghsarian was wearing grey pajamas and a red and blue flannelette shirt when he was kidnapped.
New South Wales Premier Chris Minns has also pleaded for Baghsarian's safe return.
""Let police know where he's currently located or alternatively drop Mr Baghsarian off at a shopping centre or an emergency department or even a nursing home,"" he appealed to the kidnappers. ""We urge them to do that as soon as possible.""

Sussan Ley and the glass cliff: Does Australian politics still have a problem with women?,2026-02-13T03:11:21.744Z," Tiffanie Turnbull
Sydney
","When Sussan Ley made history as the first woman to take the reins of Australia's Liberal Party, she insisted this was a pivotal moment for the party – or what was left of it anyway.
She had broken through the glass ceiling: an invisible, patriarchal barrier which keeps women from positions of power.
But to many, Ley's glass ceiling looked an awful lot like a ""glass cliff"", and it felt like it was only a matter of time before she lost her grip and slipped off it.
The glass cliff describes a phenomenon where women and other minorities are promoted to leadership roles during times of crisis, setting them up for a high risk of failure. In essence, it says that when women are finally allowed to ascend to the top, it's frequently so they can take the fall.
Elected as leader after the most resounding election defeat in the history of the modern Liberal Party and amid internal party chaos, Ley didn't even survive a year.
On Friday she was pushed out by Angus Taylor, who argued she didn't have what it takes to turn the opposition's fortunes around. He won a leadership ballot 34 to 17, with Senator Jane Hume elected as his deputy.
Ley's backers claim she was never given the chance to succeed, with some saying gender played a role. Her opponents say her demise has nothing to do with that and everything to do with performance.
The messy saga has reignited conversations in Australia about its progress towards making its politics look more like its population.
Whoever took over as Liberal leader after the Labor landslide in May last year was always going to have a tough job.
They had to unify the polarised factions of the party and manage an increasingly toxic relationship with their coalition partner of eight decades, the National Party - a small but vocal and often mutinous cohort of rural MPs.
They had to overhaul a policy platform which was comprehensively rejected by voters. And they had to do this while balancing the demands of the more conservative sects of the Coalition with the more progressive desires of voters in the urban areas where they were ravaged at the polls.
Then they also had to repair the Liberals' reputation with women, who have deserted them en-masse after a string of allegations of misogyny levelled during the Coaliton's previous term of government, which ended in 2022.
""There was just crisis on every front… it's classic glass cliff,"" says Michelle Ryan, Director of the Global Institute for Women's Leadership and one of the researchers who coined the term.
From her very first press conference as leader, Ley was aware of what this looked like.
She and her supporters insisted she had been selected exactly for this moment, because she was the right person to lead the Coalition through it.
She is a moderate who can appeal to city slickers, yes, but one from a bush electorate who can speak National. She's been in parliament for 20 years and was a cabinet minister for five. With an unusual but impressive resume that includes time as a pilot and a sheep musterer, Ley says she has spent her entire life breaking down barriers, challenging assumptions and making room for herself in places women weren't always welcome.
Some critics say the idea of a glass cliff itself is offensive, that it diminishes women's achievements and assumes they can't successfully lead out of a crisis, when in fact many in the community feel women fare better in them.
""As far as political analysis goes, it is just wrong,"" Ley wrote in an op-ed for the Women's Agenda shortly after she took over.
""There is no doubt that all too often women are left to clean up the mess… But when the most successful political party in our nation's history picks a leader, it doesn't do so based on chromosomes.
""I earned my shot.""
Few are saying she didn't. But the Liberal Party famously passed over Julie Bishop in 2018, an electorally popular and long-serving minister who had been the party deputy for 11 years.
Political observers say there was a sense Ley was only keeping the seat warm for Taylor, whose first leadership bid failed by a slim margin after a controversial choice in running mate.
The glass cliff phenomenon doesn't paint the true picture of Ley's tenure though, says Niki Savva, a veteran political commentator and former Liberal Party advisor.
""Sometimes I get really impatient with the argument that all this is happening to Ley because she's a woman. She hasn't been given a fair go because she's a woman,"" she tells the BBC.
""Maybe a tiny bit, but that is not the real reason… Sussan Ley is the architect of her own fortunes.""
She promised not to make unilateral calls as leader, which seemingly opened the door to relentless pressure - public and private - from her peers. She promised to listen to the electorate on climate, but facing opposition from the conservative members of the Coalition, rolled back her party's promise to reach net-zero by 2050.
And though she played a leading role in pushing the government to hold a royal commission into antisemitism in the wake of the Bondi attack - which she says she's proud of - critics accused her of politicising the tragedy. She also oversaw two short-lived but ugly break-ups between the Liberals and Nationals.
""Political leaders are judged on their performance, not on their gender,"" Liberal Senator, and prominent Taylor backer, James Paterson said on Thursday.
""Newspoll shows she's at negative 39 personal approving approval rating. That is the worst performance of an opposition leader in 23 years.""
The driver behind her abysmal approval rating, Savva says, is her lack of conviction on issues she said she cared about.
""If she had gone out there and staked out her territory, gone out and fought for it, then maybe her position would not be as dire as it is today.""
Ryan, though, argues both things can be true.
""It really isn't about whether Ley is qualified for the job or not… It's not even about her performance in this job,"" Ryan says.
""It's about when is it that the party will put a woman ahead.""
Julia Gillard, the nation's first female prime minister, is the only woman aside from Ley to lead one of its two major parties.
She said at the end of her misogyny-plagued tenure in 2013: ""Being the first female prime minister does not explain everything about my prime ministership, nor does it explain nothing about my prime ministership.""
It's true that representation in parliament has grown dramatically since Gillard's era – largely driven by her party, Labor, who more than 30 years ago set ambitious quotas, both for selecting female candidates in winnable seats, and promoting them into leadership.
While the Coalition party rooms remain about a third female, the Labor caucus is now majority women – 57% – a historic achievement. And there is gender equality in cabinet too.
But women are still rare at the very top.
Anthony Albanese's leadership team is the first from Labor without at least a female deputy since 2001, aside from a three-month blip in 2013. Albanese was part of that woman-less leadership team too.
And though Penny Wong is senate leader and foreign minister, women still tend to have more junior cabinet roles or positions in non-cabinet ministries.
""Being able to say we've had a female prime minister, that's great, we've just got to get beyond one,"" Ryan says. ""You have to do it again, and then you have to do it again.""
But over the three decades Labor has used to increase its gender diversity through quotas, doyens of both the Liberal and National parties, even Ley herself, have been arguing they don't need them – to the frustration of many of the women in their ranks.
Gender shouldn't matter in politics, they say, something which critics say fails to acknowledge the reality that it long has, and still does.
""Instead of, as a woman, getting out there and arguing for quotas, standing up for them, Ley came out with this line, which I just thought was BS, about being a zealot for getting more women into parliament, but agnostic on quotas,"" Savva says.
""Well, what the hell did that mean? And what did she do about it subsequently? Big fat zero.""
Analysts say this reluctance from the Liberals to champion strong female candidates has helped fuel the rise of independents. More than 70% of crossbench MPs in this parliament are women, many of them so-called ""Teal"" candidates who have won in traditionally blue, Liberal seats.
Ley, who after the leadership spill announced she would resign from parliament, said there was ""no doubt"" it had been ""a challenging time to lead the party"".
""It is important that the new leader gets clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders,"" she said, a parting jab at her successor.
This episode is unlikely to help resolve the Liberal Party's quandaries.
Election post-mortems, as well as consistent feedback from polling and interest groups, point towards the desire for a more diverse Liberal Party that reflects modern Australia, and a more cooperative, stable one.
At best, recent events show disorganisation and disunity, commentators say. At worst, they're another show of a stubborn Liberal Party reluctant to learn from its mistakes.
"
This tiny Australian town is up for sale - but the locals don't want to leave,2026-01-30T19:02:00.853Z," Claire Keenan
Sydney
","Tucked away in the rugged Victorian bushland lies the tiny outpost of Licola, population: five.
Consisting of a couple of weatherboard buildings, a general store, a caravan park and a petrol station grouped around a modest main street, Licola is one of Australia's smallest towns.
And if you have a spare couple of million dollars, you can buy it. The entire village - a three-hour drive from the city of Melbourne - is now up for grabs, much to the shock and ire of tight-knit locals.
Privately owned by a local community club, Licola has long been a guaranteed pit stop for fuel, food and rest for travellers on their way to the Alpine National Park. It also has a 50-year legacy of hosting outreach programmes for young people.
But the local branch of the Lions Club says it can't afford to run the town anymore, and late last year quietly listed it for sale online.
The sale has raised alarm bells for Licola's few passionate residents, locals in surrounding areas and even other Lions Clubs state members, who say they weren't fairly consulted and now hold grave fears for the future of the town.
Nestled beside the banks of the mighty Macalister River in Victoria's high country, Licola was originally a timber mill, built in the 1950s with a few buildings for those working there.
After it closed in 1968, the Lions Club acquired the whole site and turned it into a camp where disadvantaged young people and children, and groups with special needs, could stay during school holidays.
Just around the corner from the camp, they also snapped up land which now hosts Licola's General Store and Caravan Park.
Today, Leanne O'Donnell - who runs the General Store - and her family are the only full-time residents of the town. She lives there with one of her children, along with her best friend and her two kids.
""It's just an amazing place,"" O'Donnell tells the BBC. ""When I first moved here, people would come into my store and say, 'You're not going to make a million dollars in Licola.' And I'd say, 'Who said I'm here to make a million dollars?'.""
O'Donnell purchased the business in 2022 but doesn't own the buildings, signing a lease she says she was led to believe would be extended to a 15-year term.
From day one, O'Donnell wanted Licola to be ""a home away from home"" for people. Nearly every person who visits, works or passes through Licola has O'Donnell's number – even truck drivers and the Country Fire Authority.
""I'm the main point of contact for them, regardless of whether it's three in the afternoon or two in the morning,"" she said.
O'Donnell is extremely passionate about the town and serving its surrounding community - but she now faces eviction.
""I absolutely love this town... if it gets into the hands of a developer and turns into something that it's not, it [will] just break my heart.""
O'Donnell first learned Licola was headed for the market in January 2025, from the Lions Village Licola board, which is appointed to manage the town on behalf of the charity.
""They told me that their business had been running at a loss for the last five or six years and I asked them, 'so how can I help you?',"" O'Donnell says.
""They turned around and said, unless you get a couple of million dollars, there's nothing much you can do.""
But O'Donnell persisted, offering to run fundraisers for the village and telling the board that the broader community will want to help.
The board wouldn't budge, O'Donnell says. Eventually she said: ""So you're going to buy my business?""
""And they said, no, we're just going to take your business because we own the land and we own the buildings,"" she says. ""And you just need to pack up and leave. I couldn't get it in my head and understand it at the time.""
After seeking legal advice, O'Donnell quickly realised that because she was signed to a lease, the board could do just that.
""In the real world, I could take my business and put it in another building... that's not a problem at all anywhere else except for Licola.""
Here, there is nowhere else to go.
By December, O'Donnell found a real estate listing online for the sale of the town, with an asking price of between A$6m (£3m, $4.3m) and $10m.
The sale has been met with intense backlash online from locals in the surrounding areas. Many are upset over the way O'Donnell has been treated and are concerned the beloved town could die out or be commercialised.
One user's comment on the Licola Caravan Park & General Store official Facebook page says: ""People rely on the store in town, and closing in the middle of peak season is stupidity at its best.""
Another person says selling the town ""impacts MANY Victorians that come to Licola and have camped [there] for years"".
""There are some great past leaders of Lions and leaders of the Licola village and camp whom I know are turning in their graves,"" another comment says.
Other Victorian Lions members wrote to the Lions Village Licola Board, accusing it of acting without due process and consultation with the broader Lions Club members it is supposed to represent.
An online petition to save the store, ""renew the lease and let Leanne stay"", has more than 8,000 signatures.
As outrage grew, the Lions Village Licola board said its staff were receiving threats and it was considering withdrawing them from the town.
In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson said the sale was prompted by a review into the town's operations, which was provided to all Lions in Victoria.
After the review, the board decided it was no longer sustainable for the Lions Club to own the village, listing rising costs and insurance prices, aging accommodation, and a decline in camp attendance as the main reasons.
""The decision to sell was not made lightly,"" the statement said.
Chairman Denis Carruthers has said the board has a responsibility to protect the mission of the Lions Village - supporting disadvantaged youth - not just the physical space.
""The Lions District Governors have been briefed and are supportive,"" he told the BBC.
The board also said in their statement that O'Donnell's lease ""was not renewed in order to consolidate revenue during a period of financial stress"". O'Donnell has been told she has to vacate the premises by 31 January this year.
All proceeds of the sale of the Licola properties and future business profits will be reinvested into a new foundation, which will continue to pay for children to attend camps run professionally across Victoria, it said.
Whether future camps will continue to run in Licola is unknown at this stage, Carruthers added, with a planned camp for January cancelled due to low numbers.
It remains unclear who the new owners will be – or what they will want to do with the town.
But, he said, there is ""considerable interest in the property"".

Four attacks in 48 hours: How east Australia's beaches became a 'perfect storm' for sharks,2026-01-24T05:11:18.719Z," Gavin Butler
","It's ""extraordinary"", says Chris Pepin-Neff, an expert in policy responses to shark attacks: four shark bites within 48 hours, and three of them within a 15km (9-mile) stretch of Australia's east coast.
On 18 January, a 12-year-old boy was taken to hospital with critical injuries and later died after being attacked while swimming in Sydney Harbour. The next day, an 11-year-old's surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition.
Then, on 20 January, a fourth surfer ""sustained a wound to his chest"" after a shark bit his board some 300km up the coast.
""This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I've ever seen in my 20 years of research,"" says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney.
The succession of incidents caused alarm and dozens of beaches have been closed because of fears of more attacks. Calls for shark culls have gathered momentum.
Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish.
Many factors may have contributed to the recent series of incidents, they say – and the sharks are not the problem.
Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both.
The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127mm of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years.
Jodie Rummer, Professor of Marine Biology at James Cook University, says such weather could have created attractive conditions for sharks.
""Storms and river outflows create flood plumes that carry nutrients and fish into coastal waters, which can attract prey species and, in turn, predators like sharks,"" she tells the BBC.
""Coastal species, like bull sharks and some whaler sharks are particularly known to move toward these plumes because they are following food and favourable conditions, not people.""
Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University whose research specialises in recreational sport and leisure in areas such as oceans, estuaries and rivers, said conditions would have been ""perfect"" for bull sharks.
""Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,"" she told the BBC. ""They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them.""
Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks.
""There's clearly an attractant in the water,"" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a ""perfect storm"" of low salinity freshwater could have created a ""biodiversity explosion"".
""The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem.""
Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards.
That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.
These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.
As Rummer explains: ""We have more people in the water than ever before, which naturally increases the chance of encounters.""
""The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,"" Pepin-Neff explains.
They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites ""doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things"".
Olive echoes this point, noting that ""given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common"".
If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.
Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.
When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an ""attack"", the danger seems greater than it is.
""There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',"" they explain. ""And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.""
In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.
""Three shark attacks in three days in Sydney. This didn't happen because of the weather or the time of day, it happened because there are too many sharks,"" former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott posted to Facebook following the recent series of attacks. ""It's way past time to reintroduce the shark fishery.""
The Australian state of Queensland already uses lethal measures as part of its statewide shark control program. A recent report from KPMG found that between 2024 and 1962, when the program began, there was an average of 2.3 shark ""incidents"" and 0.35 deaths per year in the state. Before 1962, there was an average of three bites and one death per year.
While the report noted the evidence was correlative, and did not necessarily prove lethal measures caused a reduction in attacks, the Queensland Government has used it to justify the expansion of its shark control program.
Among experts, however, the efficacy and overall benefits of shark culls are broadly rejected.
A peer-reviewed analysis of 67 shark-bite mitigation studies – due to be published in next month's Marine Policy journal – found little evidence that lethally removing sharks reduces shark bites or lowers attack risk.
This echoes what numerous other marine and ecological experts have been saying for years: that reducing shark attacks is not as simple as reducing shark populations.
An oft-cited study into shark control programs in Hawaiian waters, where thousands of sharks were removed over nearly two decades, showed that such programs ""do not appear to have had measurable effects on the rate of shark attacks"".
As Rob Harcourt, emeritus professor of marine ecology at Macquarie University, recently told the university's news platform: ""Culling the shark population won't do anything"".
""I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,"" says Olive.
Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that ""It just doesn't work"".
""It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.""
In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.
""It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.""
Rummer, Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.
More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.
""In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,"" says Pepin-Neff. ""Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.""
This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.
""This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,"" they say. ""The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.
""We're in the way, not on the menu.""
Update 18 February: This article has been updated to include comments from a marine biologist. We have also added further context on shark culling practices and expanded on the roles of Chris Pepin‑Neff and Rebecca Olive.

A national tragedy 30 years ago united Australia. Why hasn't the Bondi shooting?,2026-01-22T23:23:32.206Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","Thursday had been earmarked for Australians to mourn the victims of last month's Bondi shootings.
Those who had lost loved ones in the antisemitic attacks wanted it to be a chance to remember the dead, and spread light and kindness in their honour.
Instead, it was a day dominated by a political row resulting in the collapse of the opposition coalition.
""I mean, you would have thought they could have put this off for 24 hours,"" veteran political commentator Malcolm Farr told the BBC.
""It's at the very least unfortunate timing and shows a certain amount of self-indulgence.""
The fight - which centred around reforms sparked by the tragedy - looks set to sink two leaders and trash their parties' electoral chances, and caps off what many Australians say has been a disappointing month of politics.
When two gunmen opened fire on an event marking the Jewish festival of Hanukkah at Bondi Beach, killing 15 people - including a 10-year-old child - the recriminations began almost immediately.
""The turnaround was amazing in the way they [politicians] politicised it,"" says Bondi local Kass Hill, 52. ""The fingerpointing isn't solving anything.""
While families were waiting to bury their loved ones, a conveyer belt of politicians - including the opposition leader - visited the scene to apportion blame. Populist leaders came to rail against immigration. Prominent businesspeople popped by to pose with flowers.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, accused by many Jewish Australians of ignoring their concerns ahead of the attack, spent the weeks after it dismissing calls from many in the community for a national inquiry into antisemitism.
He was repeatedly heckled in public, arriving at a memorial to a tidal wave of boos and cries of ""You're not welcome"". ""You might as well go to a jihadist nation where you can fit in,"" one person shouted. Looming over the crowd, a large screen read ""a night of unity"".
Criticised as being overly defensive and slow to listen, Albanese has in turn rebuked his parliamentary rivals for ""playing politics"" with tragedy.
The 14 December Bondi attack was Australia's worst mass shooting since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, when 35 people were killed, but the responses to the tragedies couldn't be more different.
Then Prime Minister John Howard visited the scene of the shooting in Tasmania to lay wreaths together with opposition leaders, who shortly afterwards united to help him pass firearms laws that made Australia a world leader on gun control.
""Australian society and politics is very different than it was 30 years ago and we're just a far more divided society,"" says John Warhurst, an emeritus professor of political science at the Australian National University.
There are a number of reasons why this attack has divided people in ways Port Arthur didn't - including the already fraught debate raging in Australia over Israel, Gaza and antisemitism, according to Mark Kenny, a political columnist and host of the Democracy Sausage podcast.
""Then this event lobs into that, [and] I think it led to it being immediately politicised,"" he told the BBC.
Since the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas and protests in Australia against Israel's war on Gaza which followed, Albanese has consistently been accused of failing to do enough to stamp out antisemitism. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry says antisemitic incidents have increased from an average of 342 before the 7 October attacks in 2023 to 1,654 last year.
Likewise, he's been accused of not doing enough to call out Israel's actions in Gaza, which UN experts have called genocide and Israel denies.
Hours after the Bondi shooting, the antisemitism commissioner appointed by Albanese linked it to the pro-Palestinian protests that have regularly taken place in Sydney and which Jewish leaders have lobbied against.
""It began on 9 October 2023 at the Sydney Opera House,"" Jillian Segal said in a statement. ""Now death has reached Bondi Beach.""
Investigators have not said there is any link between the alleged gunmen and the pro-Palestinian movement, instead alleging the pair were inspired by the jihadist group Islamic State, with the younger of the father-son duo on intelligence agencies' radars for a period in 2019.
As it was after Port Arthur, gun reform was the first thing on the legislative agenda after the Bondi attack.
""We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney's suburbs... There's no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns,"" Albanese said as he announced a suite of changes in the following days.
Unlike Port Arthur, when the measures were broadly popular, Albanese's focus on gun laws was immediately attacked by the Liberal opposition and parts of the Jewish community as a distraction from what they view as the real cause of the attack – antisemitism. Even Howard, the architect of the 1996 reforms, came out to suggest they were an ""attempted diversion"".
""That kind of 'either or ism' is a feature about politics these days probably everywhere in the West. Everything becomes supercharged and divisive,"" says Kenny.
""There's just this fundamental lack of trust that's almost like we're in the grip of a toxic cynicism that means that motives of political leaders… the first instinct is to question them, to regard them as disingenuous.""
The recent decision by a festival in Adelaide to disinvite a Palestinian-Australian author – leading ultimately to the collapse of the entire writers' week portion of the event – due to ""sensitivities"" after Bondi and her ""past statements"" is also a sign of how tense the current circumstances are, adds Kenny.
Demands for immediate action on antisemitism were loud in the days after the attack, and Albanese did soon announce a crackdown on hate speech, backed by the antisemitism commissioner.
But some critics said the measures would impinge on free speech, including the right to criticise Israel, and on protest, while others argued they did not go far enough in protecting other minorities.
""[It's] a can of worms,"" says Warhurst, noting that there has never been ""an easy agreement on finding where that balance lies"" between free speech and hate speech.
""Now is the worst time, I think, to be trying to resolve those sorts of issues because you are doing it fairly quickly and you're doing it in a heated environment.""
The hate speech laws had the backing of the Jewish community, but many felt it was not enough - with several of the victims' families pushing Albanese to call a royal commission, Australia's most powerful form of independent inquiry.
For weeks, Albanese argued the measures already announced were enough and that a royal commission would be the wrong tool to unpick what had happened. It could give a platform to antisemites, he said.
Royal commissions had not been launched into previous tragedies like Port Arthur, Albanese pointed out, comments which were widely dismissed. Promised reviews of intelligence agencies and law enforcement similarly did nothing to dissuade those calling for the inquiry.
Their pleas were mirrored by a coordinated campaign of letter writing that featured on the front pages of right-wing newspapers. ""I don't think it's controversial to say that the News Limited and other parts of the media were certainly stirring the pot,"" says Warhurst.
Albanese's arguments against a royal commission were ""really hard to make in these circumstances"", says Kenny, and it backfired on him when he was ultimately forced to reverse course on the issue.
Analysts have also suggested his reluctance may have been down to fears it could become complex, controversial and divisive. It could invite discussion of the war in Gaza, while potentially excluding examination of Islamophobia – which exploded after Bondi, with The Islamophobia Register Australia recording a 740% rise in incidents by early January - when many Labor MPs have large Muslim electorates.
There was likely also a ""reluctance to cave to the opposition"", Farr believes: opposition leader Sussan Ley had vociferously demanded the royal commission, asking what Albanese was ""hiding"", and revelled in his backflip.
It is fair to say that, before December's attack, Ley had been struggling to land a punch on the government and assert authority over her own party. In the weeks before the shooting, some pundits were even predicting her imminent ousting.
""The Bondi attacks offered her an opportunity to prosecute a very strong case against the government,"" says Kenny.
But any momentum she gained over the royal commission collapsed this week when she failed to rally her Coalition behind the very hate speech laws she had so loudly demanded Albanese quickly implement.
By Thursday - the national day of mourning for the Bondi attacks - things had fallen apart.
The National Party announced they were leaving the coalition, having refused to vote for the legislation despite a shadow cabinet agreement. They, despite earlier calls for haste, said they had not been given enough time to examine the proposals which they said could threaten free speech.
On his way out the door, Nationals leader David Littleproud suggested the only way his party would consider returning to the fold was if Ley was dumped, leaving her already shaky leadership hanging by a thread.
""I'm quite sure there are people... who are polishing their shoes and tightening the knot on their ties to step forward should that vacancy occur or be forced,"" says Farr.
However, Littleproud's bold ultimatum could be an overstep which costs him his own job, with mutterings that Liberals wouldn't accept him as a leader in any future coalition either.
But then, it seems all of Australia's politicians may be on shakier ground.
The posturing of the main parties over the past month has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Australians. In a poll released earlier this week, Albanese's net approval rating had plunged to minus 11 from his previous score of zero in November, while Ley's approval rating - never high - barely budged at minus 28.
The repeated calls for unity by politicians who simultaneously fail to heed their own statements will not have gone unnoticed, and Thursday's display of political infighting is unlikely to improve the fortunes of any party, says Farr.
""It will reinforce the view of so many Australians who already are cynical about what politicians, no matter their party, actually represent and will reinforce the belief that politicians, MPs, just stand for themselves rather than the national good.""

Why Sydney is preserving thousands of flowers after deadly Bondi attack,2026-01-21T19:54:14.214Z," Katy Watson
Australia correspondent
","From the outside, the vacant shop on the corner of a busy avenue in central Sydney looks abandoned. Plastic sheeting is taped across all the windows and there's a large padlock hanging on the door handle.
Step inside, though, and you're greeted by cuddly toys, candles, trinkets and messages of hope scribbled on large sheets.
All of them come from a makeshift memorial that was created after the 14 December attack at Bondi Beach that killed 15 people.
So when the Sydney Jewish Museum and the Australian Jewish Historical Society heard that the memorial would be removed by the local council, they sprang into action to ensure everything contained within it could live on.
Many of the items now live in neat squares made out of masking tape on the shop floor.
One says ""bees"" - within it are dozens of knitted and cuddly insects - a nod to 10-year-old Matilda Bee, the youngest victim of the attack.
Another has a heap of deflated foil balloons – again, mostly bees.
There's also a box of stones – Jewish mourners traditionally place a stone on a grave instead of flowers – as well as flags, books, Christmas decorations and even a Barbie cracker.
Some families who were unable to go to any of the vigils in Bondi have also paid a visit to the spaces housing the tributes.
""It was too overwhelming to be in Bondi, but in this space it was very quiet. And I think to see everything laid out and the amount, they found it really moving and meaningful,"" said Shannon Biederman, the senior curator at the Sydney Jewish Museum.
Families also came to the flower space and were given flower pressing to do, while artists and community members joined in too.
For Shannon, memorialising the items is a deeply personal task.
Her family were regular attendees of Chanukah by the Sea - the festival targeted by the alleged gunmen. They had bought tickets to go but at the last minute, they changed their mind.
They also knew the family of Rabbi Eli Schlanger, one of the 15 victims.
""I do work in a Holocaust museum, so the murder of Jews isn't something that I'm not used to, and I've learned to compartmentalise,"" she says.
""But it's different because I'm used to working with history and this is now, and we are a museum of memory, but we're still very much live in [this].
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the first to lay a bouquet in front of the Bondi Pavilion the morning after the attack. Over the course of a week, the tributes spread like a wave across the forecourt.
The massacre at Bondi was Australia's worst mass shooting in nearly three decades and left the country reeling. It also saw people pointing the blame at the government for letting something like this happen to a community that had been repeatedly warning authorities about a rise in antisemitism in recent years.
But the conversation is now trying to focus on bringing people together - a sentiment the community wants to see continued in a permanent memorial to the dead.
On Thursday, landmarks across the country will also be lit up and a minute's silence held in honour of the victims. Australians are also being asked to perform a mitzvah – an everyday act of kindness such as checking in on a neighbour or a donation - a Jewish tradition and a way to bring people together after last month's attack.
How the memorial will live on is still unclear – several artists have come forward, keen to work with some of the material but a committee will make the final decisions.
And while the toys and trinkets were catalogued - there was the greater challenge of dealing with the flowers that had been left behind.
Volunteers helped to preserve the three tonnes of bouquets and wreaths that were loaded into black bags and taken to a separate warehouse in North Sydney.
The process was confronting, says Nina Sanadze, a Jewish artist from Melbourne, whose idea it was to save all the flowers and oversaw the operation.
""When they brought them here, they looked like 100 bodies,"" Nina says. ""It was shocking again.""
Once at the warehouse, dozens of volunteers began the slow process of hanging them up on metal fences that had also been sourced in haste.
They also had to wear masks to protect themselves from the large amount of pollen circulating.
Shannon also feared that the sheer quantity of flowers and the gases they were emitting could create a compost fire, so volunteers had to monitor temperatures carefully and brought in fans.
""The smell and the moisture here in the warehouse was overwhelming,"" says Nina. ""It was like being inside a perfume shop.""
Meanwhile the flowers kept on coming.
""After the council made decision to clean up this big collection of flowers, people continued to bring them,"" explains Nina. ""We had volunteers to go at night and collect them otherwise they'd get thrown away.""
The stalks have been saved for compost – which Nina says she's considering turned into some kind of furniture.
Some of the rose buds had also started to rot, but she's dried them out and made a resin artwork scattered with the salvageable petals.
""There's a lot of decay and sadness as well as beauty,"" she says of her improvised creation. ""[It] takes it straight into the storytelling of what happened - it's not a thing of perfect beauty but it's a story, it's a heartbreak and love all together.""
Though a heavy task, for many of the volunteers, helping preserve the mountain of tributes left at the site is a form of therapy.
And while the concept for the memorial is still germinating, Nina has already pinned down the title.
""Petal by Petal,"" she says confidently. It speaks to the way volunteers have had to methodically go about preserving the material, and symbolises her own slow processing of the attack.
""I started with a lot of anger coming here,"" Nina admits. ""I feel like I'm leaving in better spirits.""
She hopes the resulting artworks and memorials can help the community do the same.
""It can soften hearts, it can communicate,"" she says. ""And one of the things with flowers is not only they speak of the fragility of humans, but also they have no language, everybody understands flowers.""

Watchdog to investigate Sydney police after anti-Herzog protest violence,2026-02-13T05:09:53.747Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","The New South Wales (NSW) Police watchdog will investigate allegations of misconduct against officers after violent clashes with people protesting against a visit by the Israeli president.
The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission said it had decided it was ""in the public interest"" to investigate Monday's police operation after receiving a ""significant number of complaints"".
Videos that emerged after the rally appeared to show police punching protesters and dragging away a group of praying Muslim men. A state MP was among those who said she was injured.
NSW's police commissioner has previously defended officers, saying they showed ""remarkable restraint"" after protesters ignored directions.
The commission said on Friday that it would review all available material, including video footage, as well as conducting hearings before delivering a public report to the state parliament.
Thousands of people attended the rally, protesting against Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who has been accused of inciting genocide against Palestinians in Gaza by a UN commission - which he denies.
Despite objections from pro-Palestinian groups, the government invited him to Australia after an antisemitic attack at Bondi Beach in December, saying it would help the Jewish community heal.
The Palestine Action Group (PAG), which organised Monday's protest, welcomed the investigation and called on NSW Police Commissioner Malcolm Lanyon and NSW Premier Chris Minns to resign.
""The police operation bore all the hallmarks of a police riot, targeting peaceful demonstrators,"" said Amal Naser. ""Genocide is a crime. Protest is not.""
The Australian National Imams Council said on Friday that the police conduct had not reflected ""the Australia we know"" and reiterated its demand for an apology.
The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network (APAN) said there must be ""transparency"" and ""consequences where wrongdoing occurred"", adding that the protest exposed ""a disturbing pattern of anti-Palestinian racism"".
""This is not only about one protest nor just about the Palestine justice movement - it is about the shrinking of democratic space and an attack on the fundamental freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly,"" said APAN's Katie Shammas.
Immediately after the Bondi attack, Minns introduced restrictions on protests and ahead of Herzog's visit announced additional ""major event"" powers effectively giving police authority to shut down areas of the city.
Monday's rally took place just half an hour after protesters lost a legal bid to overturn the major powers designation.
The rules allowed demonstrators to gather but forbade them from marching. Police say ""a number of melees"" broke out after crowds were ordered to move away from the area.
Twenty-seven people were arrested at the protest and nine later charged, while 10 officers were assaulted, police said.
NSW Police said in a statement that it will ""work co-operatively"" with the watchdog inquiry.
""The LECC is a strong and independent oversight body, and we respect this process,"" Police Minister Yasmin Catley said.
Minns has previously defended police actions, saying on Tuesday that police had been ""put in an impossible situation"", urging the public ""not to look at a 10-second clip without the full context"".
On Thursday, he refused to apologise to the Muslim community for police breaking up their prayer, saying he did not believe officers would have done so ""unless it was in the middle of a riot"". Lanyon has apologised ""for any offence that may have been taken"".

Australia's Liberal Party ousts first woman leader,2026-02-13T00:42:24.954Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","The first female leader of Australia's Liberal Party, Sussan Ley, has been ousted after just nine months in the job, losing a leadership ballot to her former shadow defence minister Angus Taylor.
Ley was elevated to the role after the party suffered a resounding defeat in last year's election, but since then has been plagued by poor poll numbers and infighting among the conservative Liberal-National Coalition.
Taylor had announced he would challenge her for leadership of the opposition on Wednesday, ending months of speculation.
In a social media post he said his election on Friday was ""an immense honour"" and that he looked forward to working with new deputy leader Jane Hume.
Taylor, from the party's conservative faction, won the secret ballot, 34 votes to 17.
Shortly after the results were announced, Ley said that she would resign as an MP and step away ""completely and comprehensively from public life"".
She told waiting reporters she harboured ""no hard feelings"" towards the new leader although, in an apparent jab at the infighting she has endured, she added that it was important he get ""clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders"".
Taylor, who narrowly lost the 2025 leadership contest to Ley, is a former management consultant who first entered parliament in 2013. He served as a minister under Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison.
Ley's position had never seemed secure. The Liberal-National coalition, a partnership dating back to the 1940s, twice split under her leadership, the first time immediately after the May election and the second time just weeks ago.
A series of recent polls have also shown the populist One Nation Party - which only got 6% of the national vote last year - overtaking the Coalition to take second place behind Labor. Ley's personal ratings have also been poor.
The coalition has largely failed to agree on what caused its crushing election defeat to Labor, which saw the Liberals all but wiped out in the major cities, with disagreements on energy and climate policy in a particular.
Reflecting on her time at the helm, Ley said it had been ""very tough"" at times but added: ""I was part of the early punk rock movement in Canberra, I will continue to find wisdom in one of punk's defining themes, a fearless and honest belief in yourself.""

Australia's first female Liberal leader faces leadership challenge,2026-02-11T23:34:13.178Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","Australian opposition leader Sussan Ley, the first woman to head the Liberal Party, is facing a leadership challenge from her shadow defence minister after he resigned from the front bench.
Angus Taylor confirmed he would run for the leadership on Thursday, saying the country was in ""trouble"" and that the Liberal Party ""has lost its way"".
Ley narrowly defeated Taylor in a leadership contest last year, after her party's worst ever election loss. But since then she has been plagued by poor poll numbers and infighting among the conservative Liberal-National coalition.
The partnership, which dates back to the 1940s, has twice split and reunited under her leadership, further undermining her tenure.
Taylor - from the conservative faction of the party as opposed to Ley's moderate wing - on Wednesday announced he had quit the party leadership team. Local media say he has long been plotting to oust Ley.
""We have failed to hold a bad Labor government to account,"" he told reporters, adding that the party needed to ""protect Australians' way of life"" and ""focus on restoring their standard of living"".
He said he did not believe Ley was ""in a position to be able to lead the party as it needs to be led from here"".
After his announcement on Thursday, several of his Liberal colleagues also submitted their front bench resignations, including shadow home affairs minister Jonno Duniam and shadow finance minister James Paterson.
According to local media, Taylor's supporters have requested a special party room meeting to consider a so-called spill motion, which would mean the party's leadership is up for contest. Such a meeting could come as soon as Thursday, but would be up to Ley's discretion.
Ley has yet to publicly comment on the leadership challenge but her supporters told local media she was considering the spill motion request.
A victory for Taylor would put an end to months of speculation around Ley's leadership, which has never seemed secure.
The coalition reunited after its most recent split just days ago, following a row over hate speech laws for which Ley had pushed after the Bondi Beach attack in December, but which her Nationals colleagues refused to support.
When announcing the initial split in January, Nationals leader David Littleproud pointedly said his party could not serve in a shadow cabinet under Ley.
A series of recent polls have shown the populist One Nation party - which only got 6% of the national vote last year - overtaking the Coalition to take second place behind Labor. Ley's personal ratings are also poor.
The coalition has failed to agree on what caused its crushing election defeat to Labor, which saw the Liberals all but wiped out in the major cities.
Immediately after the election the coalition briefly split amid argument over climate and energy policy including its commitment to a net-zero emissions by 2050 policy, which the Liberals later agreed to abandon under pressure from the Nationals and its own right-wing.
The Nationals are based in rural areas and lean more conservative than the Liberals. Political analysts say the recent surge in One Nation support has pushed them further to the right in a bid to win back votes at a time when the Liberals need to appeal to more centrist voters in the cities.

"Australian author's erotic novel is child sex abuse material, judge finds",2026-02-10T06:44:35.927Z," Tiffanie Turnbull
Sydney
","An Australian author has been found guilty of creating child sex abuse material in the form of an erotic age-gap romance novel.
A New South Wales (NSW) court heard the book explores a relationship between 18-year-old Lucy and her father's 45-year-old best friend Arthur - detailing the much-older man's desires which began when the protagonist was a child as well as passages where she roleplays as a toddler.
Lauren Mastrosa, a marketing executive for a Christian charity, was charged after the book sparked outrage online but in court she argued Lucy is clearly identified as an adult in the novel.
However, Magistrate Bree Chisholm on Tuesday found Mastrosa's story ""sexually objectifies children"".
Mastrosa, 34, issued an advance release of the novel - which the BBC has chosen not to name - to 21 readers in March last year before a complaint about its content was made to police.
Chisholm read the whole book, published under the pen name Tori Woods, and found a reasonable reader would find it ""undeniably offensive"".
Throughout the novel - the cover of which is pastel pink with the title spelled out in children's alphabet blocks - the protagonist uses child-like language, wears children's clothing, and engages in child-like behaviour.
Chisholm said any references to the character being 18 were insufficient to overcome the implication of her as a child.
""Importantly, those descriptions and language are used in the portions of the book to describe a character similar to a young child when the sexual activity is occurring,"" Chisholm said, according to the Australian Associated Press.
""The reader is left with a description that creates the visual image in one's mind of an adult male engaging in sexual activity with a young child.""
Found guilty of one count each of creating, possessing and distributing child abuse material, Mastrosa will return to court to be sentenced on 28 April.
When Mastrosa was charged, BaptistCare told the Daily Telegraph she had been stood down from her role pending an investigation.

Australia's opposition coalition reunites after row over hate-speech laws,2026-02-08T03:33:19.220Z," Chris Graham
","Australia's Liberal-National Coalition, the country's main opposition, reunited on Sunday, more than two weeks after the centre-right partners split in a row over hate speech laws.
""The coalition is back together and looking to the future, not to the past,"" Liberal Party leader Sussan Ley said, appearing alongside National Party leader David Littleproud in Canberra.
The coalition split on 22 January after the Nationals refused to back reforms introduced by the government after two gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach in December, citing free speech concerns.
""It's been disappointing, we've got to where we are but it was over a substantive issue,"" Littleproud said.
The coalition suffered a heavy election loss last year and the split last month was the second in less than 12 months.
Last year's separation in May - largely over climate and energy policy - was resolved within a week.
This time the divisions were sown by hate speech reforms introduced by the centre-left Labor government after the Bondi Beach attack.
While the Liberals sided with the government, their National colleagues abstained from the vote in the lower house and voted against the measure in the Senate, saying the measures had been rushed and posed a threat to free speech.
The legislation includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence.
Ley said the coalition had a responsibility to find a way back into government.
""I acknowledge this has been a difficult time. It has been a difficult time for millions of our coalition supporters and many other Australians who rely on our two great parties to provide scrutiny and leadership,"" she said.
The Liberal leader said both parties had struck an agreement that neither party could overturn decisions taken by the coalition's joint ""shadow cabinet"".
Dating back to the 1940s, the coalition had not split since 1987 before the brief separation last year.
The National Party mainly represents regional communities and often leans more conservative than the Liberals.
The coalition is facing pressure from populist Senator Pauline Hanson's anti-immigration One Nation party, which has surged in polling, while the Liberal Party lost a swathe of seats at last year's federal election.

The woman tasked with kicking Australian kids off social media,2026-02-07T19:22:08.483Z," Katy Watson
Australia correspondent
","The interview with Julie Inman Grant is yet to start - she is not even in the room - when the conversation turns to the barrage of death and rape threats her office deals with on a weekly basis.
The job of heading up Australia's eSafety Commission has put her squarely on the frontlines of internet battles - over fake news, censorship, trolling and children's safety.
The online world can be a ""cesspit"", a colleague admits, noting the vast majority of abuse lobbed their way is targeted at Inman Grant personally.
""Unfortunately, I've been living that reality for the past several years,"" the 57-year-old tells me herself a few minutes later, in her office overlooking Sydney Harbour.
After decades spent working in the private tech industry, Inman Grant now finds herself on the other side: holding some of the world's most successful companies accountable as head of Australia's independent online safety regulator.
It has arguably made her the country's most famous bureaucrat. But it's also made her a target.
She was doxxed by neo-Nazi groups, has sparred publicly with Elon Musk and has even drawn the ire of some in the US Congress.
All that while being tasked with implementing the country's pioneering social media ban on teenagers - or, in simpler words, kicking every Australian under the age of 16 off social media.
Inman Grant's job has always been a high-stakes one but, with the world watching how Australia's social media experiment turns out, now more so than ever.
Ten platforms come under the legislation, which came into force on 10 December, including Meta's Facebook and Instagram, as well as Snapchat and YouTube.
Parents across Australia have widely supported the policy. For many, having the government on their side helps when they are at loggerheads with pre-teens desperate to get on to social media.
But there are plenty of critics. Technology experts and child wellbeing advocates have voiced concern, saying children need to be educated, not banned from platforms.
Many question the ban's enforceability and say it unfairly excludes minority groups such as rural kids, disabled teenagers and those who identify as LGBTQI+ - all of whom are more likely to find their communities online.
Unsurprisingly, none of the companies are hugely supportive either. Across the board, they have said they share the government's concerns about online safety and will comply with the law, but don't think a ""ban"" is the way to go.
Inman Grant argues anything that could help protect children online is worth trying.
""If we can delay [kids'] entry into social media for three years, and we can supplement that with digital action plans so that we're building their critical reasoning skills and resilience, then that's something that I think is worth exploring,"" she says.
It's at this point she often likes to compare the digital world with the open water - a clever tactic, perhaps, to draw in Australians proud of their relationship with the ocean and their beautiful beaches.
""Just like with water safety, we have to continue teaching our kids to swim until they're strong swimmers,"" she says. ""We need to teach them about risks, like algorithmic rips. We need to teach them about predators in the water. It's sharks online, it's paedophiles and other scammers.""
But she's also used the water analogy to argue against a ban in the past.
""We do not fence the ocean or keep children entirely out of the water but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,"" she said in June 2024, while the government was still weighing up the ban.
""I actually had to come around to it,"" she admits now. After pushing to be given freedom in how it was rolled out, she was persuaded. And her role has been central in shaping which companies will be included and how they must comply.
She jokes her own home, which she shares with three children, including 13-year-old twins, has become a ""laboratory"". ""I had one [child] that wasn't really fussed about the idea, but another who thought the sky was falling [in] that her Instagram and her Snapchat might be taken away.""
She's not put off though. ""They're in the midst of figuring out who they are, building their identities,"" she says.
""I was able to screw up as a teenager and not have it filmed and amplified all over the place.""
Inman Grant's own formative years were spent in the orbit of the tech world. She grew up in the US city of Seattle, the home of Microsoft and Amazon.
It's perhaps little surprise then that she fell into this line of work, after briefly flirting with the idea of working for the CIA.
She took a job at Capitol Hill, advising a US congressman on telecommunications and technology. From there, she did a masters in international communication before taking a job with Microsoft.
It was a posting at Microsoft that brought her to Australia in the early 2000s, just as the social media scene was starting to flourish. Here, she met her husband and has now become an Australian citizen.
As part of her work with Microsoft, Inman Grant looked for security vulnerabilities and safety breaches. After 17 years, she moved to Twitter's Australian operation and then briefly to Adobe.
While these tech companies were booming as the use of smartphones and apps proliferated, she felt there was an elephant in the room. Safety, she believed, wasn't being prioritised. This was an era without government regulators.
""[So] I tried to change things from the inside out.""
After more than two decades, she decided to see whether change could happen from the outside instead.
When the job of eSafety Commissioner came up, she bashfully explains there was a small pool of candidates to choose from. The man who helped write the bill, Malcolm Turnbull, went on to become prime minister. He hired her and, she says, wanted a commissioner with a background in online safety, but also experience in the tech sector itself.
""[The government] didn't think you could be an effective regulator unless you knew the people and you knew the levers and you knew how they were thinking and you could anticipate their moves,"" she recalls.
""[You have] to understand that all of this is driven by revenue and growth and who has the power in the companies.""
The role is one that has since been championed by politicians of all stripes, in what many see as a testament to how Inman Grant has managed the office. And especially so in a period that has seen scrutiny on the internet safety watchdog grow dramatically, its budget quadruple, and its remit and staff expand exponentially.
'[It's] frankly an extraordinary tenure in what is a fast-moving, pretty unforgiving type of space for a regulator,"" Inman Grant's predecessor Alastair MacGibbon says of her work. ""The office has just become more relevant by the day.""
Former Communications Minister Paul Fletcher, who helped appoint Inman Grant and worked with her closely for several years, said she has tackled the personally demanding role with vigour and courage.
""People take it for granted in a modern Western nation, that if you're assaulted or robbed or something else bad happens to you in the physical town square that you can get redress,"" he told the BBC.
""The rule of law needs to apply in the digital town square as well as in the physical town square, and the eSafety Commissioner is really a very clear manifestation of that.""
While Australia sees itself as a world leader in the online safety space, some tech companies, headquartered in other parts of the world, have long accused the country of overreach.
""We've been regulating big tech for online safety for 10 years, and for the first seven years, we were the only ones,"" Inman Grant says.
As we speak, Inman Grant is resisting a request from the US Congress to testify about Australia's social media ban laws and has been referred to by the Republican House judiciary chair as a ""noted zealot for global takedowns"" who ""threatens [the] speech of American citizens"". Jim Jordan has even threatened her with contempt charges if she refuses to give evidence.
Inman Grant says she's not responsible for defending the policy, and can only really speak to its implementation: ""Nothing that we do here affects the ability of American companies to show any content that they like to Americans.""
She is also preparing to fight at least two High Court challenges against the ban - one from online forum Reddit and another from a pair of Australian teens - while also pursuing companies found in breach of the nation's array of online safety laws through the courts.
This, though, is far from her first rodeo.
In 2024, after a bishop was stabbed in Sydney during a service that was livestreamed, Inman Grant asked for the video to be taken down from X. The company's owner, Elon Musk, refused.
Instead, he called her a ""censorship commissar"" to his millions of followers and the abuse towards her reached a whole new level.
A report by Columbia University found Inman Grant was the target of tens of thousands of abusive posts, including death and rape threats. On 23 April 2024 alone, the report counted 73,694 mentions of Inman Grant or the eSafety Commissioner's office on X. Before then, the daily average was just 145.
While eventually the video was geo-blocked in Australia, it was still available around the world. The internet watchdog took X to court, but the case was ultimately dropped.
She tells the BBC it's a cautionary tale. Police in the UK say the very same video was watched by Axel Rudakubana shortly before he stabbed three girls to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport later that year.
""[This kind of content] normalises, it desensitises, and it sometimes radicalises,"" she says. ""At some point you have to take a stand.""
But even as she and her office grapple with pulling off Australia's social media ban, Inman Grant is gearing up for new battles, now zeroing in on artificial intelligence (AI).
The world was ""late to the game"" with social media regulation, and it cannot afford to do that with AI, she explains.
""That's going to be the next and a much more pressing threat, to be honest.""
But she may not be in the job long enough to see the fruits of that fight. She has been commissioner for nearly a decade now. Her second five-year term comes to an end next year.
""I think it will probably be time to hand over the reins to someone else. As I said, this takes a lot of resolve and a lot of resilience. It's been the privilege and the honour of a lifetime.""
Before tech companies breathe a sigh of relief though, she hints she won't be swayed from her career-long mission of making the tech world safer.
""Maybe that means helping other governments establish online safety regulation and helping companies really embed safety by design.""

'My life was transformed when I got rare sheep disease on holiday',2026-02-07T08:17:59.376Z," Iona Young
","When Sally Crowe returned from holiday with what felt like ""the worst hangover ever"" she had no idea it would transform her life forever.
The illness would leave her bedbound for almost two years and struggling with its after effects for more than a decade, but she says it has ultimately given her a new outlook on life.
Sally, who runs a 65-acre croft with sheep and cattle in Caithness, has become a popular figure after featuring on BBC TV show This Farming Life.
But the 48-year-old says her approach to farming had to change after she caught Q fever on a visit to Western Australia in 2012.
She had been visiting friends who were working in a sheep-shearing shed when she caught the rare and potentially life-threatening airborne disease contracted from farm animals.
When she returned to the UK feeling unwell her initial symptoms left medics stumped.
""I went back and forth to the doctors and they had no idea what it could be,"" Sally says.
""We looked at Lyme disease which is very similar to Q fever but nothing came back.""
She says it took 18 months to figure out what was causing her symptoms.
""Initially I was diagnosed with ME - a chronic fatigue - and told there was nothing they could do,"" she says.
""I had gone from being really active to doing nothing and spending 18 hours a day in bed.""
Even after being diagnosed, it was another four years until Sally found a treatment plan that had an impact.
""When we found out it was Q fever there weren't many treatment options in Scotland,"" she says.
""I had heard of it but it's very rare here.
""Only 5% of people who get the infection actually go on to develop chronic Q fever so it's just one of those really unlucky things.
""It's a hard infection to treat, the medication can't kill the infection, it will always be there. You can only get it under control.""
After carrying out research online, Sally found a specialist in South Africa and started treatment in 2016.
She was put on a year-long course of drugs consisting of one week of antibiotics followed by three weeks of an anti-malarial medication.
""It was really rough, going through week after week of treatment,"" she says.
""It was really awful at times and hard going.
""The first couple of months I didn't feel much difference but the third month hit me hard and really kicked in.""
Despite a challenging start to the treatment it soon became life-changing, as week- by-week pieces of her life were put back in place.
She welcomed her son William in 2019 through IVF and has since found a new appreciation for putting life before work.
""I realised I couldn't go on doing what I was doing,"" she says
""I was burning myself out, I wasn't making any money and I thought I would have to give up the croft.
""I spent a long time being seriously ill, when you don't have the energy to do the things you want and you've been stuck in bed for so long, you realise what is important.
""It completely changed my life. Now if I do physical work one day I can only do something that involves mental strength the next.""
Sally continues to run the croft - which has been in her family since 1972 - with 60 breeding ewes, about nine cows and dozens of hens.
But her main joy is spending time with her six-year-old son William.
""I feed the cows before my son finishes school and do the basics on the croft then spend time with William,"" she says.
""I don't work weekends usually - they are there to enjoy.
""I want to spend time with him and hang out. He is six now and still thinks I am really cool.
""So I probably only have another seven or so years of that, I want to make the most of it.""
According to the NHS website, Q fever is a bacterial infection you can catch from infected farm animals such as sheep, cattle and goats. It's usually harmless, but it can cause serious problems.
Some people get flu-like symptoms within two to three weeks of being infected, including a high temperature, aching muscles, tiredness and feeling sick.
It is most often spread to humans by close contact with infected farm animals, especially through their blood, urine, faeces and animal skin, fur and wool.
Although Q fever is rare, people who work closely with animals are more at risk, such as farmers, vets, stable hands and abattoir workers.
There is currently no licensed vaccine for Q fever available in the UK.
Chronic Q fever sometimes leads to serious heart problems, such as endocarditis.

Coin portrait of late Queen draws criticism in Australia,2026-02-06T11:53:57.491Z," Kathryn Armstrong
","Two commemorative coins, released by the Royal Australian Mint and bearing a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, have been criticised for their lack of resemblance to the late monarch.
The $5 (£2.56) and 50 cent silver coins, created to commemorate the centenary of the Queen's birth, were released in an online ballot that closed on Wednesday.
""That's got to be the most unpleasant portrait on a coin,"" said one of several people who reacted negatively online. The Royal Australian Mint defended the portrait, saying: ""Our coin images don't always capture the full beauty of a design once it's etched in metal.""
Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022 at the age of 96 and was the UK's longest serving monarch.
""There's a reason most portraits are from the side. Looks like she just ran into a wall,"" one person commented underneath a Facebook post from the mint.
""If I saw that face without the hairdo and pearls, would never guess who it was meant to be,"" another said.
Comparisons have been made with various TV characters, including Mrs Doubtfire - the beloved fictional housekeeper in the comedy film of the same name, played by the late Robin Williams.
Other people were more positive about the design, which was created by one of the mint's artists.
""Awesome. I'm glad they put something out to do with Queen Elizabeth II, she deserves to have Recognition In a Special Way,"" one user wrote on social media.
""Please pick me for one of these coins,"" said another. One woman living in the US commented that it ""looks like a beautiful coin"".
Despite the criticism, collectors reported that the ballot was fully subscribed.
Australian media, quoting a spokesperson for the Royal Australian Mint, said the silver proof coins had sold out, and there were limited stocks left in their contact centre and shop.
According to the mint's website, it created 30,000 of the 50c coins and 5,000 of the $5 - all of which are collector's items and will not enter general public circulation.
As well as the queen's portrait, the coins feature designs ""symbolically reflecting the many facets of Queen Elizabeth II's life and legacy"", the mint said.
These include motifs of a horse and corgi, references to art and theatre to mark ""her enduring support for culture"", as well as some of her favourite flowers - roses and lily of the valley. The golden wattle, Australia's national floral emblem, is also represented.
""The design incorporates Her Majesty's Royal Cypher, a stylised St Edward's Crown and the Auxiliary Territorial Service emblem, acknowledging her wartime service and lifelong sense of duty,"" the mint added.
Meanwhile, the backs of the coins feature a portrait of the Queen's son, King Charles, in profile.

Suspect identified in disappearance of four-year-old in Australian outback,2026-02-05T06:42:41.745Z," Lana Lam
Sydney
","Police say a suspect has been identified over the disappearance of a four-year-old boy who went missing in the South Australian outback.
Gus Lamont was last seen playing outside his home on a remote sheep station near Yunta, about 300km (186 miles) from Adelaide, on 27 September.
His grandmother left him alone for about half an hour before checking on him, only to find the boy missing, prompting one of the largest land and air searches in the state's history.
Police said a person who lives on the property has been identified as a suspect but confirmed the boy's parents were not under investigation.
In the days and weeks after the boy was reported missing, police conducted extensive searches, covering about 470 sq km - an area roughly twice the size of Edinburgh - around his home, the Oak Park station homestead.
In late October, police wound down efforts and appointed a 12-member taskforce to continue the investigation.
That taskforce sifted through previous statements given by family members which ""identified a number of inconsistencies and discrepancies"" of the timeline around the boy's disappearance.
""As a result of these inconsistencies, and investigations into them, a person who resides at Oak Park station has withdrawn their support for the police and is no longer cooperating with us,"" Detective Superintendent Darren Fielke said.
""I do want to stress, however, that Gus' parents are not suspects in his disappearance.""
Police conducted a search of the property in January and seized a number of items including a vehicle, motorcycle and some electronic devices.
Investigators said they had initially considered three possible scenarios - the boy walked off, he was abducted, or someone known to Gus was involved in his disappearance and suspected death.
Given the remote location of the property, police ruled out abduction and there was no evidence to suggest Gus had ""merely wandered off"".
""What I can say, however, is that we'll continue to thoroughly and meticulously investigate the disappearance of Gus until we get an outcome,"" Fielke said.
""We're all focused and determined to locate Gus and return him to his parents. Nothing is off the table as we work towards that outcome.""

Man charged with terrorism over attack targeting Aboriginal Australians at protest,2026-02-05T06:31:13.625Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","A man has been charged with terrorism after he allegedly threw an explosive device at a crowd protesting the celebration of Australia Day in Perth last month.
The 31-year-old man was detained after hurling a homemade bomb into a throng of around 2,500 people who had gathered in support of the Aboriginal community.
The device, which was filled with ball bearings and screws, failed to explode, but authorities said it could have turned into a ""mass casualty event"".
Australia Day - a national holiday on 26 January - marks the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet in Sydney Cove and the start of colonisation. For many Indigenous Australians and their supporters, it is known as Invasion Day.
Police had already charged the man - whose identity has been suppressed by the courts for his safety - with committing an unlawful act with intent to harm and one count of making or possessing explosives under suspicious circumstances.
West Australian Premier Roger Cook on Thursday told reporters it is alleged ""the attack on Aboriginal people and other peaceful protesters was motivated by hateful, racist ideology"".
""Thankfully [the device] did not detonate but for that we could have seen a mass casualty event with injuries and potential loss of life,"" Cook said.
The fresh charge - which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment - is the first time terrorism charges have been laid in the state, police say.
""I know this event has impacted people Australia-wide and it is deeply felt by our Indigenous communities,"" Cook said. ""I know that there is anger. We have every right to be angry.""
West Australian Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the bomb had a fuse which had been lit, adding: ""It should have gone off.""
He said police had no prior intelligence of the attack, and that the man was ""self-radicalised"" and acted alone. During their investigation, detectives had found evidence the man had accessed ""pro-white male, pro-white material online"", he alleged
Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Krissy Barrett told reporters federal police and Asio, Australia's domestic intelligence agency, had been called into the investigation 36 minutes after the device was thrown and worked around the clock to establish whether there was any ongoing threat.
The man, who is remanded in custody, is next due to appear in Perth Magistrates Court on 17 February.

Australia police charge man with abuse of 459 children,2026-02-05T04:50:33.382Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","A man who ""actively targeted"" children on social media and gaming platforms has been charged with hundreds of child-abuse related offences against 459 victims in Australia and 15 other countries, Queensland police have said.
The 27-year-old, who has been in custody since last February, has been charged with 596 offences after police found more 23,000 videos and images of the alleged abuse on his electronic devices.
The ""volume"" of images and videos meant the process of identification took ""time, skill and commitment,"" Detective Acting Chief Superintendent Denzil Clark of Queensland Police said.
A total of 360 of the victims have so far been identified and investigations were ongoing, he added.
More than 200 of the victims were in Australia, with the rest overseas, mainly in English-speaking countries, police said. Most of them were boys aged between seven and 15.
Police were still working with international partners to identify victims and ""ensure they are provided appropriate support,"" Clark said.
He warned of an ""increasing prevalence of children being groomed, coerced, or threatened into taking and sending sexual images of themselves, often through popular apps, games, and social media sites.""
""The trauma that this causes a child is significant,"" he added.
Speaking to reporters he declined to name the sites used by the man but said they were ""very popular"". All the offending was online, he said, and other suspects were also being investigated.
The man allegedly targeted children between 2018 and 2025, creating multiple online profiles and posing as both men and women, police said.
The man recorded his interactions and used ""grooming and coercion"" to have his victims send him sexually explicit material that he ""meticulously"" saved to ""named folders"".
The charges include 244 counts of producing child abuse material through a carriage service, 163 counts of using a carriage service to procure persons under 16 years of age and 87 counts of engage in sexual activity with a child using carriage service.
The man was due to appear in court on Thursday.

Doctor who treated Bondi Junction mass killer referred to health regulator,2026-02-05T03:12:05.680Z," Lana Lam
Sydney
","A psychiatrist who treated the man behind a fatal stabbing rampage at a crowded Sydney shopping centre will be referred to health investigators after a coroner's inquiry.
Joel Cauchi, first diagnosed with schizophrenia in his teens, was unmedicated and homeless when he stabbed 16 people inside Westfield Bondi Junction in 2024, killing six.
The New South Wales coroner said Dr Andrea Boros-Lavack had provided 40-year-old Cauchi ""exemplary"" care over a long period, but failed to heed warnings from family that he may be relapsing, years before the attack.
This mistake was one of many that led to the tragedy, the coroner said, also pointing to a series of actions by police and shopping centre security.
Six people - Dawn Singleton, 25; Yixuan Cheng, 27; Jade Young, 47; Ashlee Good, 38; Faraz Tahir, 30; and Pikria Darchia, 55 - died during the attack in April 2024.
Ten others, including Good's baby, were injured in the six minutes before Cauchi - who was suffering a psychotic episode - was shot dead by New South Wales (NSW) police inspector Amy Scott.
During a five-week coroner's inquest that finished last May, the coroner heard from dozens of witnesses including doctors, police, survivors and the families of victims in a bid to unearth the events leading up to the attack and prevent such a tragedy occurring again.
The coroner's 800-page plus findings were due to be released at the end of 2025 but they were delayed as a mark of respect for the victims of the Bondi Beach attack, in which 15 people were killed by two gunmen on 14 December.
On Thursday, Teresa O'Sullivan told the coroner's court that Boros-Lavack had provided ""personalised, consistent and compassionate treatment"" for Cauchi for many years after she first took him on as a private patient in 2012.
Between 2018 and mid-2019, the Queensland psychiatrist had worked closely with Cauchi to wean him off the medications he had been taking to treat his condition, a move that was not criticised by the coroner.
However, in late-2019 when Cauchi's mother raised concerns that her son was possibly relapsing, Boros-Lavack ""failed to take more active steps or to recognise the seriousness of the situation that was unfolding before her"".
She said it was a ""major failing"" for the doctor to ""not do more to proactively urge Cauchi to resume his medication"".
When Cauchi moved to another city and and came under the care of a different doctor, a discharge letter from Boros-Lavack also failed to provide enough information to prompt intervention, the coroner said. It didn't emphasise the need for Cauchi to see a psychiatrist or that an urgent review of his case should be a priority.
O'Sullivan's recommendation that Boros-Lavack be investigated by Queensland health authorities followed calls by some of the victim's families for such action.
She also found there was a missed opportunity for police intervention after an email raising concerns about Cauchi's mental health was not acted upon due to staff shortages .
The officer ""overlooked a single email amidst a significant workload"", O'Sullivan said.
The inquest heard a security guard who was the sole person in the CCTV control room at the Westfield when Cauchi attacked his first victim was ""not competent"" for that role. However, O'Sullivan said this was the fault of the shopping centre, which has since improved its processes.
Among her 23 recommendations, O'Sullivan also called on the NSW government to improve its mental health outreach services and provide short-term housing for people with mental health issues.
The coroner praised the police and emergency services response to the stabbings, describing them as ""commendably rapid and extensive"" but said there were issues with the ""inter-operability"" between various agencies that could be improved.
She also recommended a public awareness campaign with the message of ""escape, hide, tell"" when there is a situation with an armed offender.
O'Sullivan, though, did criticise some media coverage, which she said ""exacerbated the trauma already being suffered"" by victims and families affected, and said she would be making recommendations to the Australian Press Council on how reporters should cover incidents that involve mass casualties.
The coroner also recommended bravery awards for the police officer who shot Cauchi, two Frenchmen who tried to stop Cauchi during the attack, the husband of victim Jade Young, and Ashlee Good, who died while trying to shield her baby.
Outside the court, Noel McLaughlin - Young's husband - said the inquest mattered greatly.
""The evidence has shown that what first appeared to be a sudden and random act of violence was, in fact, the end point of a long story,"" he said.
Earlier, Cauchi's parents released a statement, saying they hoped the coroner's findings would prevent such a tragedy happening again.

"'I don't think I am a hero': Boy, 13, describes 'superhuman' swim to save family",2026-02-03T13:19:08.375Z," Flora Drury
","The 13-year-old Australian boy who swam for hours to get help for his family after they were swept out to sea has told the BBC ""I didn't think I was a hero - I just did what I did"".
Austin Appelbee didn't know if his mother Joanne, brother Beau and sister Grace were still alive when he finally reached the shore, four hours after he left them in the water clinging to two paddleboards.
Miles out to sea off Australia's west coast - the waves getting bigger, the light beginning to fade - his mother feared he too may not have made it.
Only hours later, after Joanne finally spotted the rescue boat, did she know he was safe. By that time she and the children had drifted 14km (8.5 miles) offshore.
What had started as a family day at the beach had ended in a 10-hour ordeal for Joanne and her family. Austin's swim to raise the alarm was later described as ""superhuman"" by rescuers.
""I had assumed Austin hadn't made it,"" Joanne, 47, told the BBC News channel.
In the end though, ""it was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries"".
The family had been due to head home to Perth last Friday and were having ""a bit of fun"" with two paddleboards and a kayak in the shallow water off the beach, Joanne explained, when the children ""went out a bit too far"".
""The wind picked up and it went from there,"" she recalled. ""We lost oars, and we drifted out further.... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly.""
Finding themselves drifting further and further out from Quindalup beach, in Western Australia, Joanne realised she needed to do something - but she couldn't leave Beau, 12, and Grace, eight, alone.
""Early on, we sent this young man back in to try and get help because it didn't look like we were that far from the shoreline,"" she said.
Austin took the kayak, but no one realised it had been badly damaged and was already taking on water.
""It started flipping, and then I lost an oar and I knew I was in trouble,"" he recalled. ""I started paddling with my arm.""
At one point, he managed to get the kayak to work - before it threw him for the last time.
Clinging to the capsized kayak, Austin - who swears he ""saw something in the water"" - realised he needed to do something.
""It was getting dangerous now - I had been out for a couple of hours.""
He had lost sight of his family, who had also lost sight of him. As Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, the waves got bigger and bigger, making it harder to stay on the boards, while visibility had also got worse. They were all wearing life jackets - but they had no food or water.
""I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,"" she said. ""As the day progressed, no vessels and nothing coming to save us.
""If he hasn't made it, what have I done, have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?""
Austin, meanwhile, had started to swim the last 4km (two nautical miles), abandoning his own lifejacket after a time because it was not helping him.
Throughout the next two hours, it was prayer, Christian songs and ""happy thoughts"" which kept the ""really scared"" 13-year-old going.
""I was thinking about mum, Beau and Grace. I was also thinking about my friends and my girlfriend - I have a really good bunch of friends,"" he said.
""When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now - is this a dream?""
Then he had another thought: his family ""could still be alive out there - I have to go save them"".
It was about 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) when he finally reached his mother's bag and rang for help.
The call sparked a huge search, police said in a statement on Monday.
Austin - who had passed out after making the call - was taken to hospital where he called his father, bawling his eyes out. He still didn't know if Joanne and his siblings were alive.
Then, minutes later, he got a call to say they had been found. Everyone - doctors and police officers - were jumping up and down with joy.
""It was a moment I will never forget,"" said Austin.
Out at sea, Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children. They were freezing cold, and it was now dark. She now feared the worst had happened to Austin.
""We couldn't see anything coming to save us,"" she said. ""It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.""
Joanne couldn't even relax when she saw the boat approaching: the children had fallen into the water and she was desperately trying to reach them.
""It was an absolute nightmare,"" she said.
Back on dry land, they were treated at hospital for minor injuries. The same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm - finally - he too had survived.
He's even been back at school - admittedly on crutches, as his legs were so sore.
Now, less than five days later, Austin is still trying to process what happened. He certainly doesn't see himself as a hero, despite what people keep telling him. It was, he acknowledged, a ""tough battle"".
His praise is reserved for the ""lovely ambulance crew"" and the ""really quick response"" from triple zero, the emergency services.
Others, however, have been effusive with their praise for Austin.
Naturaliste Volunteer Marine Rescue Group's commander Paul Bresland described the efforts of the teenager as ""superhuman"".
Meanwhile, Insp James Bradley said his actions ""cannot be praised highly enough - his determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings"".

","A 13-year-old boy has been praised for his determination after he swam through rough waters in fading light to save his mother and two siblings who had been swept out to sea off Australia's coast.
The family had been paddleboarding and kayaking at Geographe Bay in the south of Western Australia, on Friday when strong winds pushed their inflatables off course, police said.
The teenager began to paddle back to shore to raise the alarm but his kayak took on water - so he swam the remaining 4km (2 nautical miles).
""The bravery, strength and courage shown by this family were extraordinary, especially the young fella who swam 4km to raise the alarm,"" Naturaliste Volunteer Marine Rescue Group said.
The organisation's commander Paul Bresland described the efforts of the teenager as ""superhuman"".
""He swam in, he reckons, the first two hours with a life jacket on,"" he told ABC News. ""The brave fella thought he's not going to make it with a life jacket on, so he ditched it, and he swam the next two hours without a life jacket.""
The boy was able to raise the alarm by 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Friday evening, sparking a huge search for the missing relatives from Quindalup beach, near Busselton, WA Police said in a statement on Monday.
The boy's 47-year-old mother, her other son, 12, and daughter, eight, were located at around 20:30 by a rescue helicopter clinging to a paddleboard about 14km offshore.
""A volunteer marine rescue vessel was directed to their location and all three were successfully rescued and returned to shore,"" the force said.
Insp James Bradley said the incident was an important reminder of how rapidly ocean conditions can change.
""Thankfully, all three people were wearing life jackets, which contributed to their survival,"" he told local media.
""The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough - his determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.""
The family were assessed by paramedics before being taken to a nearby hospital, police said.
The family were later discharged and visited the marine rescue crew to say thank you, the ABC reported.

Australian PM says man who allegedly tried to bomb rally deserves 'full force of law',2026-01-28T06:40:58.807Z," Koh Ewe
","Police should ""throw the book"" at a man who allegedly lobbed a homemade bomb into a crowd at a rally in support of Indigenous Australians, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said.
The 31-year-old man was detained after hurling an item into a throng of around 2,500 people who had gathered in Perth to mark Australia Day, police said.
While many across Australia celebrated the country's national day on Monday, many Indigenous Australians and their advocates held ""Invasion Day"" rallies to commemorate the cultural destruction of Indigenous communities under European settlers.
Police said the device did not detonate and no injuries were reported.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Albanese said the the incident was ""quite shocking"", but added that he could not comment any further as ""the matter is now before the courts"".
""I look forward to him being prosecuted to the full force of the law,"" he added.
The man - whose identity is suppressed by a court order - is charged with making explosives and intending to do harm, but police are investigating whether he can also be charged with terrorism offences.
Authorities say the object thrown was ""a homemade improvised explosive device"" containing a mixture of potentially explosive chemicals, nails and metal ball bearings.
In a subsequent search of the man's home, police said they found a ""combination of chemicals and materials consistent with the manufacture of homemade explosives"".
Western Australia's Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the incident was being treated as a ""hostile act"" but added police are investigating whether there was political, religious or ideological motive to the alleged attack - a requirement for terror charges.
The alleged bomb incident comes during a time of heightened sensitivity for Australians, after 15 people were killed in a shooting last December at a Jewish festival on Sydney's Bondi Beach.
After the incident at the Perth rally, West Australian Premier Roger Cook said ""we can't let hate win"".
""Now, more than ever, it is important that we treat each other's views with respect,"" he said. ""It's our differences and diversity which has made Australia the country that we all love.""
The man has been remanded in custody and will appear in court again on 17 February.

","A man has been arrested after allegedly throwing a device that police believe may have contained explosives into a crowd in Australia, police have said.
The incident occurred shortly after 12:30 local time (04:30 GMT) on Monday in a pedestrianised square in Perth, where the state premier said thousands had gathered for a rally supporting the rights of Indigenous people. It also coincided with the national holiday, Australia Day.
The 31-year-old man was detained at the scene and remains in custody. Police said the device did not detonate and no injuries have been reported.
It comes less than two months after an attack on Sydney's Bondi Beach targeting a Jewish festival left 15 people dead.
Witnesses to Monday's incident in Forrest Place said they saw the man throw an object towards the front of a stage while speeches at an Invasion Day rally were taking place, public broadcaster ABC News reported.
Western Australia Police Commissioner Col Blanch told reporters the device had not exploded but contained ball bearings and screws wrapped around an unknown liquid inside a glass container.
He said forensic investigators were in the process of identifying the liquid, describing the device as ""very rudimentary"" and about the size of a medium coffee cup.
Blanch said police ""do not believe there is any ongoing threat to the community"".
Australia Day, on 26 January, marks the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet in Sydney Cove and the start of colonisation. For many Indigenous Australians and their supporters, it is known as Invasion Day.
The contentious public holiday often sees large protests take place in major cities across Australia.
Western Australia Premier Roger Cook described the incident in Perth as ""completely unacceptable""
""We can't let hate win,"" he said. ""Now, more than ever, it is important that we treat each other's views with respect. It's our differences and diversity which has made Australia the country that we all love.""
Australia's national terror threat level is currently considered ""probable"", the third-highest rating on a five-point scale.
Several Australia Day events were cancelled or scaled back this year due to extreme heat, with parts of the country experiencing temperatures in excess of 40C.

Australia Day - 26 January - is the anniversary of the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet, which began the era of colonisation.
But to many people, especially Indigenous Australians, the occasion is a reminder of their cultural destruction under European settlers - referring to the occasion as ""Invasion Day"".
Across the country on Monday, huge crowds gathered for rallies in support of Indigenous Australians.
Aside from Victoria and South Australia, heatwave warnings have also been issued in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.
Many of these warnings will remain in place until Wednesday.
""We haven't seen heatwave conditions like this in Victoria for almost 20 years,"" Tim Wiebusch, Victoria's emergency management commissioner, told ABC.
""It was 2009 ahead of the bushfires where we saw those prevailing conditions and so we are indicating to all Victorians that this is a very serious set of weather conditions.""
On Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology warned of ""extreme fire dangers"" across parts of South Australia and much of south-western Victoria ""due to very hot and dry weather combined with moderate to gusty winds"".
Firefighters in Victoria are working to combat several fires across the state, which have prompted evacuations and threatened properties.
The heat has also affected the Australian Open at Melbourne Park.
Tennis player Jannik Sinner was seen suffering from cramps on the court on Saturday, before play was temporarily suspended in the rising heat. Nearly 80,000 fans were warned to take care under the scorching sun.
Meanwhile, parts of Western Australia were pummelled by Tropical Cyclone Luana over the weekend. The storm damaged homes and a popular beach resort before weakening as it moved inland.
The meteorological bureau has advised people to find places to keep cool, like their homes, libraries, community centres or shopping centres. It also told people to close their windows and draw the curtains to keep heat out of their homes.

"Boy, 12, dies from injuries after Sydney shark attack",2026-01-24T05:10:24.687Z," Katy Watson

","A young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital.
Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark.
""We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away,"" his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement.
The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days.
""Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him,"" his family, who were originally from Argentina, added.
Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon.
However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery.
An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308).
There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney.
On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered ""life-changing"" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach.
One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite.
The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital.
The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a ""perfect storm"" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water.
They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.
Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.

"Social media firms have come to ban 'kicking and screaming', says Australia eSafety boss",2026-01-23T11:32:53.129Z," Katy Watson
Australia correspondentandTabby Wilson
","Social media platforms do not want Australia's landmark social media ban to be successful in case it incentivises other countries to follow suit, the nation's internet regulator has told the BBC.
""These companies have come to this regime, if you will, kicking and screaming - very very reluctantly,"" eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.
Australia began forcing social media firms to block users aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms in December, a policy being closely watched by other world governments.
The UK is considering similar legislation; this week, the House of Lords voted to support a ban for under-16s via an amendment to the government's schools bill.
Australia's ban was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.
Companies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online, but do not think a blanket ban is the answer, with some experts raising similar concerns.
In an update earlier this month, the Australian government said 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children had already been shut down, declaring the policy a huge success.
Inman Grant told the BBC children had proved to be an ""incredibly lucrative"" market for social media platforms, noting the addictive properties of platforms that were initially designed for adults.
""They're building a pipeline for the future, and they do not want this to be the first domino,"" she said, adding that they do not have a ""huge incentive"" to ""perfectly"" comply with the ban.
""We've always had to play a bit of a dance with the tech companies, clearly they don't like to be regulated.""
With the legislation coming into effect just over a month ago, Inman Grant said researchers were still carefully monitoring the resulting shifts in behaviour among young people.
One criticism had been that under-16s would simply migrate to other platforms following the ban, but Inman Grant said the data indicated otherwise. While there was an initial spike in downloads of other social media applications, she claimed there has been no sustained uptick in their usage.
Another concern had been that children would circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that is performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.
Under the law, firms face fines of up to A$49.5m ($33m, £24.5m) if they fail to take ""reasonable steps"" to keep children off their platforms, and Inman Grant said a second series of concerns notices is about to be sent to companies, naming the platform Snapchat as a key focus.
""We're starting to see some anomalies and weaknesses and I will probe those,"" she said.
""There are some kids that are getting through Snapchat, which is one that has been a primary focus for now,"" she said, adding that she needed to probe whether the platform had implemented its settings in the right way.
""[The policy] is certainly exceeding our expectations, but we are playing the long game here,"" she said, adding that regulators will always have to take a dynamic approach to the safety of young people online.
Inman Grant also told the BBC that Australia was working with ""like-minded"" countries such as the UK to take a stand against platforms where ""terrorist violent content is openly available to young children"".
She gave the example of Southport killer Axel Rudakubana who was found to have accessed graphic footage of the stabbing of Australian bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel on X, before leaving home to carry out the attack.
""When terrorist violent content is so openly available to young children it normalises, it desensitises and it sometimes radicalises - at some point you have to take a stand.""
Australia is not the first country to experiment with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, it is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.
Ten platforms are currently included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch.
It currently does not include dating websites, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord, or AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves and for having ""sensual"" conversations with minors.
Social media platforms have regularly pushed back on the legislation, with Meta arguing that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.
Though Reddit has complied with the ban, it has also launched a challenge in Australia's highest court, where it will argue that the policy has serious implications for privacy and political rights.
Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats.
""We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,"" she told parliament in November.

Fugitive Australian shooter on bail at time of alleged murders,2026-01-23T05:54:58.865Z," Toby Mann
Sydney
","A man wanted over the shooting deaths of three people in a small Australian town was on bail for domestic violence offences at the time, police have said.
Authorities are still searching for Julian Ingram, 37, who allegedly opened fire on four people in Lake Cargelligo, about 450km (280 miles) west of Sydney, on Thursday afternoon.
""Our last sightings were on a road out of Lake Cargelligo,"" NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Andrew Holland told reporters in an update on Friday.
Local media have reported that one of the people killed was the pregnant former partner of Ingram, 25-year-old Sophie Quinn.
Citing police sources, they say the other alleged victims included a friend of Quinn, found shot dead alongside her in a vehicle.
A relative of Quinn was killed in a second shooting that took place soon after the first incident, which has also left a 19-year-old in a critical condition in hospital.
""All the victims appear to be related to the offender at this stage, and that's the avenue our investigations will take at this point,"" Holland told reporters.
The families of the victims ""were not doing well"", he added.
Quinn's mother, Cathy Quinn, told Nine newspapers her daughter did not have ""a mean bone in her"", describing her as a ""a fun girl to be around"".
Quinn was reportedly seven-months pregnant and was due to give birth to a son in March.

Holland said Ingram, also known as Julian Pierpoint, had never held a gun licence and police are investigating how and where he ""gained access to the firearms"".
About 100 officers, including members of tactical units, are involved in the ongoing search for Ingram.
An employee of the local council, Ingram has great local knowledge, Holland said.
""It would be feasible that he could obviously maintain an extended period in the local area without being detected,"" Holland said.

Australia has banned social media for kids under 16. How does it work?,2026-01-23T01:39:48.764Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","Under-16s in Australia have been banned from using major social media services including Tiktok, X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and Threads.
They cannot set up new accounts and their existing profiles were deactivated.
The ban is the first of its kind and has been watched closely by other countries.
Australia's government said the ban would reduce the negative impact of social media's ""design features that encourage [young people] to spend more time on screens, while also serving up content that can harm their health and wellbeing"".
A study it commissioned in 2025 found that 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media, and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content. This included misogynistic and violent material as well as content promoting eating disorders and suicide.
One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victim of cyberbullying.
Ten platforms are currently included: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch.
The government assesses potential sites against three main criteria:
whether the platform's sole or ""significant purpose"" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users;
whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and
whether it allows users to post material
YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp have not been included as they were not deemed to meet those criteria.
Under-16s are also still able to view most content on online platforms that do not require an account.
Critics have called on the government to extend the ban to cover online gaming sites like Roblox and Discord, which are not currently included.
In November 2025, Roblox said it would introduce age checks on some features.
Children and parents are not punished for infringing the ban.
Instead, social media companies face fines of up to A$49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches.
The government says firms must take ""reasonable steps"" to keep kids off their platforms, and should use multiple age assurance technologies.
These could include government IDs, face or voice recognition, or so-called ""age inference"", which analyses online behaviour and interactions to estimate a person's age.
Platforms cannot rely on users self-certifying or parents vouching for their children.
Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, began closing teen accounts from 4 December last year. It said anyone mistakenly kicked off could use government ID or provide a video selfie to prove their age.
Meta said it blocked approximately 550,000 accounts during the first days of the ban.
Snapchat said users could use bank accounts, photo ID or selfies for verification.
Initially, there were fears that age assurance technologies may wrongly block adults while failing to spot underage users.
The government's own report found that facial assessment technology is least reliable for teenagers.
Questions were also raised about the scale of the potential fines.
""It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make A$50 million in revenue,"" former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told the AAP news agency.
Critics have also argued that the limited scope of the ban - even if properly implemented - undermined its ability to protect children.
Dating websites have been excluded, along with gaming platforms and AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves and for having ""sensual"" conversations with minors.
Others think that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.
Some teens told the BBC they had set up fake profiles ahead of the deadline - although the government warned social media companies to identify and remove such accounts. Others switched to joint accounts with their parents.
Critics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data required to verify users' ages.
Australia - like much of the world - has had a series of high-profile data breaches where sensitive personal information was stolen and published or sold.
But the government insists the legislation incorporates ""strong protections"" for personal data.
These stipulate that it may only be used for age verification and must be subsequently destroyed, with ""serious penalties"" for breaches.
Social media companies were aghast when the ban was first announced in November 2024.
Firms argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, and would pose risks to their privacy.
Companies also suggested it might drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact.
Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies.
Days before the ban was due to take effect, YouTube said the ""rushed"" new laws would leave children less safe as they would still be able to use the platform without an account, removing ""the very parental controls and safety filters built to protect them"".
YouTube's parent company, Google, reportedly considered a legal challenge over its inclusion but did not respond to a BBC request for comment.
Despite implementing the ban early, Meta warned it would leave teens with ""inconsistent protections across the many apps they use"".
At parliamentary hearings in October 2025, TikTok and Snap said they opposed the ban but would follow it.
Kick - the only Australian company covered by the new law - said it would introduce a ""range of measures"" as it continued to engage ""constructively"" with authorities.
A day ahead of the ban Reddit said it would comply but that it had ""deep concerns"" about the law which ""undermines everyone's right to free expression and privacy"".
In the days before the ban started on 10 December, thousands of Australians sought lookalike apps to fill the void, with three little-known apps - Lemon8, Yope and Coverstar - surging in downloads. But that initial rise has since dropped.
The number of Australians downloading virtual private networks – or VPNs – also increased before the ban, but has since fallen back to normal levels.
VPN technology allows users to hide their location and pretend they are based in another country, in effect, bypassing local laws.
Teenagers the BBC spoke to a month into the ban had mixed feelings about it. One said she ""felt free"", while another said it hadn't ""really changed anything"", and that he was spending about as much time on social media platforms as before the ban, in some cases by using accounts with fake birthdays.
Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal.
A French parliamentary enquiry has also recommended banning under-15s from social media, and a social media ""curfew"" for 15- to 18-year-olds.
The Spanish government has drafted a law which would require legal guardians to authorise access for under-16s.
In the UK, new safety rules introduced in July 2025 mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.
In January, the House of Lords voted to support a ban of under-16s from social media platforms, in an amendment to the government's schools bill.
Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge in 2024.

Three dead in shooting in Australia's New South Wales,2026-01-22T22:38:48.044Z," Tessa WongandAlicia Curry
","Three people have been killed and another injured after a shooting in a small town in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
Emergency services were called to a residential area in Lake Cargelligo at about 16:40 local time (05:40 GMT) on Thursday.
Police are searching for Julian Ingram, 37, in connection with the killings.
A man and woman were found shot dead in a vehicle, and a second shooting soon afterwards killed a woman and left a man in a ""critical condition"" in hospital, police said.
Australian newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the incident was a suspected domestic violence attack and that one of the victims is believed to be Ingram's former partner.
Andrew Holland, NSW police assistant commissioner, declined to comment on the relationship between the gunman and the victims.
The public was urged to remain indoors and multiple crime scenes have been established, he told reporters.
NSW police later released a photograph of Ingram and urged the public to get in contact with any information on his whereabouts.
""Any death in a small country town is confronting, but again, a scene where you have people shot by firearms is obviously going to make people very, very tense and very concerned,"" Holland said.
""The scene faced by the emergency services officers at that time would have been horrendous.""
Lake Cargelligo is located in the centre of New South Wales and has a population of about 1,500 people.
The incident comes after last month's mass shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach which killed 15 people.

Australia's opposition coalition splits after row over Bondi shooting reforms,2026-01-22T00:49:35.883Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","Australia's Liberal-National Coalition, the country's main opposition, has split after a row over hate speech laws, casting the future of Liberal leader Sussan Ley into doubt.
The centre-right Coalition, which has been on rocky ground since a resounding election loss last year, had been divided over how to respond to reforms moved by the government after a terror attack targeting a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach killed 15 people last month.
The Nationals ultimately refused to follow the shadow cabinet decision, a breach of longstanding Coalition rules.
""Our party room has made it clear that we cannot be part of a shadow ministry under Sussan Ley,"" leader David Littleproud told reporters.
Announcing the split on Thursday - a national day of mourning for those killed in the shooting on 14 December - Littleproud said the Coalition ""was made untenable"".
He did not rule out a return to the Coalition, refusing to ""speculate"", but said it was ""probably a good thing"" if Australia's two main conservative parties spent ""some time apart"".
It is the second time in less than a year that the Nationals have pulled out of the Coalition, with a brief split - largely over climate and energy policy - in May last year resolved within a week.
Ley, whose leadership is under pressure, is yet to comment on the split. She released a statement on Thursday to mark the national day of mourning, saying ""my responsibility as leader of the opposition and leader of the Liberal party is to Australians in mourning"".
Though both parties in the Coalition voted against legislation tightening gun controls, the Liberals had sided with the Labor government on Tuesday to pass hate speech reforms introduced after the Bondi Beach attack.
But their Nationals colleagues abstained from the vote in the lower house and voted against the measure in the senate, despite a shadow cabinet agreement, citing concerns that the legislation had been rushed and posed a threat to free speech.
The laws includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence.
On Wednesday three Nationals frontbenchers offered their resignations, which Ley accepted despite a warning from Littleproud that if she accepted them the rest of the Nationals front bench would follow. The rest of the shadow cabinet duly resigned.
""This process was wasn't all Sussan Ley's fault,"" Littleproud said. ""Prime Minister Anthony Albanese put her in this process. But it has been mismanaged by Sussan Ley.""
Ley had already been struggling to assert her authority over the Coalition after being elected the Liberal party's first female leader after last year's bruising election defeat.
Some political analysts and observers had predicted she would be ousted by the end of last year and Thursday's events have reignited those conversations.
The Coalition, in its current form, dates back to the 1940s, and before the brief break-up last year, had not parted way since 1987.
The Nationals mainly represent regional communities and often lean more conservative than the Liberals.
On local radio, senior Nationals member Bridget McKenzie - who was one of the senators who went rogue - was asked: ""Why on earth are you playing leadership games today?""
""I think the timing's appalling,"" McKenzie told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), but said the question was unfair.
Former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, himself no stranger to scuffles with the Nationals, told the ABC both Coalition party leaders had ""mismanaged"" the disagreement and now faced an un-electability crisis.
""It looks like just a smouldering wreckage, doesn't it?"" he said of the Coalition.
Another former Liberal leader and one of the nation's longest serving prime ministers, John Howard, told The Australian Ley had had ""no choice"" after the Nationals senators' revolt and had ""behaved absolutely correctly"".

Australia parliament passes gun reform and anti-hate bills after Bondi shooting,2026-01-20T15:11:35.817Z," Helen Livingstone
SydneyandSimon Fraser
London
","Australia's parliament has voted for sweeping gun law reforms and a crackdown on hate speech, a month after two attackers shot 15 people dead at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach.
Both bills passed the House of Representatives and Senate at a special sitting late on Tuesday. The gun reform measures include a national gun buyback scheme and new checks on firearm licence applications.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the Bondi gunmen would not legally have had access to firearms if such a law had been in place prior to the attack, the country's worst mass shooting in decades.
Governing Labor senators were backed on the anti-hate bill by Liberal lawmakers, whose coalition partners abstained.
After last month's mass shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came under huge pressure for not having done enough to prevent the attack in the first place, amid growing fears of antisemitism in the Jewish community.
Politicians were recalled two weeks early to debate the legislation. Introducing the reforms, Burke said individuals with ""hate in their hearts and guns in their hands"" had carried out the 14 December attack.
The father in the father-son duo allegedly behind the attack legally owned six firearms, while his son had been on the radar of intelligence agencies.
The gun reform bill, which cleared the House of Representatives by 96 votes to 45, includes stricter firearm import controls and provisions to improve information sharing between intelligence agencies on people trying to obtain gun licences.
The buyback scheme will target ""surplus and newly restricted firearms"", Burke said, reducing the country's four million registered guns.
Burke added that it ""comes as a shock to most Australians"" to know that the country has more firearms that it did before the 1996 Port Arthur attack, in which a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania.
That attack, the country's worst mass shooting, had prompted the then government to introduce some of the world's strictest gun controls. The new law will bring in some of the most significant changes to Australia's guns laws since then.
The hate speech reforms had originally been included in an omnibus bill with the gun reforms but the government split the legislation last week after both the Liberal-National opposition coalition and the Greens said they would vote against.
While the Labor government has a comfortable majority in the lower house, it needs the support of other parties in the Senate.
Coalition MPs cited concerns about free speech and said the legislation was not clearly defined, among other things, while the Greens said they could not support it unless changes were made to protect all minorities and legitimate protest.
But on Tuesday, Liberals leader Sussan Ley, who last week said the bill was ""unsalvageable"", said her party had reached agreement with the government on a watered-down version.
The Liberals had ""stepped up to fix legislation"" that the government had ""mishandled"", she said in a statement, adding that the bill had been ""narrowed, strengthened and properly focused on keeping Australians safe"".
The bill includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence. It will be subject to a review every two years by a parliamentary joint committee. The opposition will also be consulted on the listing and delisting of extremist organisations.
The bill was passed by the lower house and late in the evening it cleared the Senate - by 38 votes to 22 - after the National Party abstained while their Liberal coalition partners voted in favour. The Greens voted against, saying it would have a ""chilling effect"" on political debate and protest.

Surfer injured in fourth shark attack in Australian state in 48 hours,2026-01-20T07:05:23.329Z," Tiffanie Turnbull
SydneyandKoh Ewe
","A surfer has been bitten by a shark, the fourth attack along Australia's New South Wales (NSW) coastline in under 48 hours.
The 39-year-old man ""sustained a wound to his chest"" after a shark bit his board on the Mid North Coast on Tuesday morning, police said. He has been released from hospital.
It follows three other attacks in Sydney over the past two days. All beaches in Sydney's northern area will remain closed until further notice, said police.
The attacks follow days of heavy rains, which NSW Superintendent Joseph McNulty had earlier said may have created a ""perfect storm environment"" for shark attacks. Rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.
The attack on Tuesday took place near the Point Plomer campground, about 450km (279 miles) north of Sydney.
Steve Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the surfer was ""very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries"", ABC reported.
""We really strongly advocate that nobody swim or surf near river mouths because it's obviously an area where sharks congregate,"" Pearce said. ""If it's dirty water I'd think twice about going in there.""
A young surfer had a similarly lucky escape at Dee Why Beach in Sydney on Monday, but a shark attack at nearby Manly hours later left a 27-year-old with ""life-changing"" injuries. On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was also critically injured when bitten at a popular Sydney Harbour beach.
Authorities believe bull sharks were involved in most of the recent attacks.
Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are ""one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people"", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.
Last November, a woman was killed and a man was seriously injured after being attacked by a bull shark on a remote beach, also on the NSW Mid North coast.
Bull sharks are typically seen around Sydney in January and February - the summer months in Australia - as the ""water is at their preferred temperature"", Dr Daryl McPhee, associate professor of environmental science at Bond University, told the BBC.
Though Australia is a global shark attack hotspot, the chances of being attacked are still minute - making this string of shark attacks in NSW a rare phenomenon.
""This series of bites from bull sharks in such a short period of time is highly unusual,"" said McPhee.
Police on Monday advised the public to avoid waterways in NSW due to recent weather, which has decreased water quality and visibility.
""I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time,"" Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters.
Rain can concentrate fish that bull sharks prey on downstream in rivers and beaches, McPhee said, adding that ""bull sharks are well adapted to feeding in murky water after rain"".
""Where you find the fish, you find the bull sharks. Unfortunately, that sometimes occurs at popular beach locations.""
"
Man seriously injured in Sydney's third shark attack in two days,2026-01-19T09:38:09.533Z," Kelly Ng
","Three shark attacks have been reported in Sydney in a little over 24 hours, leaving at least two people seriously injured, according to local authorities.
A man was taken to hospital in critical condition after being injured at Manly beach on Monday evening, New South Wales Police said in a statement.
Hours earlier, an 11-year-old surfer had to be assisted off Sydney's Dee Why Beach after a suspected shark bit his surfboard, with the local council urging swimmers and surfers to be cautious.
The first incident saw a 12-year-old boy taken to hospital with critical injuries after he was attacked by a large shark while swimming in Sydney Harbour on Sunday afternoon, police said.
The boy and his group of friends were jumping off a six-metre rock ledge at Shark Beach, in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse, when the attack happened on Sunday.
Despite its name, shark attacks are rare at Shark Beach, a popular swimming spot.
The boy was pulled out of the water by his friends before rescuers arrived. Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.
""The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery,"" said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command.
""Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship.""
Marine police arrived to a ""horrendous scene"", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs.
They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf.
Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world.
McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a ""perfect storm environment"" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore.
The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice.
According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT).
He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital.
Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least five fatal shark attacks in the country last year.

"'Baby, don't move': Australian woman wakes to find massive python on her chest",2026-01-16T02:32:14.582Z," Tiffanie Turnbull
Sydney
","In the middle of the night on Monday, Rachel Bloor stirred in her bed to find a heavy weight curled up on her chest.
Half asleep, she reached out for her dog - and instead found herself petting a smooth, slithering object.
As Bloor retreated further under the covers and pulled them up to her neck, her partner switched on the bedside lamp and confirmed the Brisbane couple's fears.
""He goes, 'Oh baby. Don't move. There's like a 2.5m python on you,"" Bloor told the BBC.
Her first words were expletives. The second, an order to evacuate the dogs.
""I thought if my Dalmatian realises that there's a snake there... it's gonna be carnage.""
The dogs secured outside the room - and her husband wishing he was with them - Bloor began carefully extricating herself.
""I was just trying to shimmy out from under the covers... in my mind, going, 'Is this really happening? This is so bizarre'.""
She believes the carpet python - which is non-venomous - had squeezed itself through the shutters on her window and onto her bed below.
Once freed from the python, she began casually feeding it back out the way it came in.

How Australian festival imploded after axeing Palestinian author,2026-01-13T06:52:23.726Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","One of Australia's biggest cultural festivals has been left in disarray after a decision to disinvite a prominent Australian-Palestinian writer, triggering a massive backlash, a mass exodus from fellow authors – and the ultimate cancellation of the festival's Writers' Week.
The board of the Adelaide Festival last week said Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, a vocal critic of Israel, had been removed from its Writers' Week lineup due to ""sensitivities"" after the shooting of 15 people – by gunmen allegedly inspired by the Islamic State militant group – at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach in December.
Though the Adelaide Festival's board said they ""do not suggest in any way"" that Abdel-Fattah had ""any connection with the tragedy at Bondi"", they made the decision that it would not be ""culturally sensitive"" to include her ""given her past statements"".
She called the decision to exclude her a ""blatant and shameless act of anti-Palestinian racism and censorship"" and the attempt to link her with the Bondi attack ""despicable"".
In the following days, dozens of other writers scheduled to appear withdrew from the festival, which also features music, dance, theatre and other cultural events.
By Tuesday the list had jumped to 180, including former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, British author Zadie Smith, beloved Australian writer Helen Garner and British-Australian novelist Kathy Lette.
Over the weekend, four members of the eight-member board, including the chair, resigned without detailing their reasons. And on Tuesday the director of the Writers' Week - who had invited Abdel-Fattah - stood down too.
Louise Adler, the Jewish daughter of Holocaust survivors, said art had increasingly come under attack since the start of the Israel-Gaza war and that she could not ""be party to silencing writers"".
""Writers and writing matters, even when they are presenting ideas that discomfort and challenge us,"" she wrote in the Guardian Australia.
Hours later, the board put out a fresh statement, apologising to Abdel-Fattah for ""how the decision was represented"" and announcing that the Writers' Week could ""no longer go ahead"".
""We recognise and deeply regret the distress this decision has caused,"" it wrote.
All remaining members of the Adelaide Festival board would step down bar one, it said, a move it hoped could ""secure the success"" of the festival this year ""and beyond"".
The saga has now left the festival board-less just weeks out from its start late next month, has threatened to spark legal action, and has reignited discussions in Australia about freedom of expression.
Abdel-Fattah, a novelist, lawyer and academic, had been invited to the festival to discuss her latest novel Discipline – which she describes as ""a cautionary tale about the cost of silence and cowardice"".
She has previously been criticised for statements arguing that Zionists had ""no claim or right to cultural safety"" and a 2024 post on X in which she said ""the goal is decolonisation and the end of this murderous Zionist colony"", a reference to Israel.
Controversies around her also include an image posted to her social media in the hours after the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel, depicting a person parachuting with a Palestinian flag. Hamas fighters used paragliders to cross the high-tech security fence into Israel at the start of the attack, landing in civilian areas where many residents died.
About 1,200 people were killed in the attack. It triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza, which has killed more than 71,419 people since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Abdel-Fattah confirmed to Australian broadcaster ABC that she had posted the image, but said she had done so before the true extent of the attacks was known.
""At that point, I had no idea about the death toll, I had no idea about what was happening on the ground... Of course, I do not support the killing of civilians,"" she told the ABC.
The academic has been the target of public campaigns before. Opposition politicians and some prominent Jewish Australians called for research funding awarded to Abdel-Fattah to be cancelled in 2024. After a letter from Education Minister Jason Clare, the funding was suspended while Abdel-Fattah was investigated over allegations she had bent the grant's rules, though she was ultimately cleared last month.
Norman Schueler, of the Jewish Community Council for South Australia, last week said his organisation had sent a letter to the Adelaide Festival board lobbying for Abdel-Fattah's removal.
""It was a very wise move and it will improve the cohesiveness of the festival by not having her there,"" he told the Adelaide Advertiser after her removal. Upon news of the growing walkout, he added: ""I think for everyone who has dropped out that it's rather pathetic because that means they agree with what Dr Fattah is on about... Namely, that Israel should not exist.""
South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskus - whose government is a key backer of the festival - said that he ""wholeheartedly"" supported Abdel-Fattah's exclusion and had ""absolutely made clear to the board that I did not think it was wise"" to invite her.
However, Malinauskus denied having played any role in the board's decision, telling the ABC on Monday that, though he shared his opinion, he had not threatened to withdraw funding or sack anyone. He also denied that his position was influenced by Jewish lobby groups.
Adler said the board's decision had been taken ""despite my strongest opposition"" and added: ""In my view, boards composed of individuals with little experience in the arts, and blind to the moral implications of abandoning the principle of freedom of expression, have been unnerved by the pressure exerted by politicians calculating their electoral prospects and relentless, coordinated letter-writing campaigns.""
""The board's statement cites community cohesion, an oft-referenced anxiety which should be treated with scepticism,"" she said. ""One doesn't have to be a student of history to know that art in the service of 'social cohesion' is propaganda.""
After her appearance was cancelled, Abdel-Fattah said Australian arts and cultural institutions had displayed ""utter contempt and inhumanity towards Palestinians"".
""The only Palestinians they will tolerate are silent and invisible ones.""
It isn't the first time Abdel-Fattah has been at the centre of the derailment of a writers' festival.
Two days before it was due to begin in August last year, Bendigo Writers Festival issued a code of conduct requiring speakers to ""avoid language or topics that could be considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful"".
A subsequent walkout - led by Abdel-Fattah and others over concerns it could prevent free discussion of the Israel-Gaza war - led to the cancellation of around a third of the programme.
However Abdel-Fattah has been accused of double standards, by sections of the media and Malinauskus, who claim that she had successfully demanded the exclusion of New York Times journalist Thomas Friedman from the Adelaide festival two years ago.
A letter sent by her and nine other academics to the board followed his publication of a column in which he compared players in the Middle East to members of the animal kingdom, including caterpillars, wasps and spiders.
""Call it what you like, after the correspondence from Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, they removed a pro-Jewish Israeli speaker. Fast forward two years and I think it's reasonable for the board to apply the same principle,"" Malinauskus said.
Abdel-Fattah rejected the allegations of hypocrisy, saying in a statement to the BBC that Friedman's article had ""compared various Arab and Muslim nations and groups to insects and vermin requiring eradication at a time when talk of 'human animals' was being used to justify wholesale slaughter in Gaza"".
""In contrast, I was cancelled because my presence and identity as a Palestinian was deemed 'culturally insensitive' and linked to the Bondi atrocity,"" her statement continued.
She also denied that Friedman had been removed at her behest. In a letter dated February 2024 and quoted by Australian media, the board wrote that cancelling a writer was an ""extremely serious request"" and that while Friedman had been scheduled to attend he would no longer take part due to ""last-minute scheduling issues"".
""If he was in fact quietly cancelled, it only underscores the racism of cancelling me in such a brazen and publicly humiliating manner,"" Abdel-Fattah said.
The BBC has contacted Friedman for comment.
Adler said at least 180 writers had withdrawn from the festival, devastating its programme. Some said that while they did not necessarily agree with Abdel-Fattah, they defended her right to free speech.
Australian journalist Peter Greste, who was jailed in Egypt a decade ago in what human rights groups called a sham case, in an opinion piece for the Guardian Australia wrote that her exclusion meant ""we are undermining our capacity to hold those difficult conversations"" and ""doing the work"" of extremists for them.
Kathy Lette in an Instagram post argued that audiences should be trusted to ""make up their minds about all speakers – me included. As authoritarianism rears its hideous head around the world, we need to defend these havens of free speech.""
However, former Australian foreign minister Bob Carr, who has strongly criticised Israel's assault on Gaza, said he supported Abdel-Fattah's exclusion. He told the Guardian Australia he believed some of her previous statements had been counterproductive to the Palestinian cause and that given the circumstances after the Bondi attack the decision was not unreasonable.
""The Adelaide writers' festival has supported hearing Palestinian voices, its record on this is unimpeachable,"" Carr said.
He was one of the only festival speakers to publicly back the board.
Former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis posted a video on X in which he tore up his ""precious"" and ""coveted"" invitation to speak, claiming the festival had been ""destroyed"" by the ""Zionist lobby"".
Award-winning First Nations poet Dr Evelyn Araluen said she was ""so disappointed to witness yet another absurd and irrational capitulation to the demands of a genocidal foreign state from the Australian arts sector"".
""Erasing Palestinians from public life in Australia won't prevent antisemitism,"" she added.
ABC journalist and presenter Sarah Ferguson, who had been due to host conversations with Tina Brown and Jacinda Ardern – both now cancelled – said the festival had ""created a place where debate flourished… including on our most difficult subjects"" and that it ""should be defended in our cultural life"".
In its latest statement, the board said: ""This is not about identity or dissent but rather a continuing rapid shift in the national discourse around the breadth of freedom of expression in our nation following Australia's worst terror attack in history.""
The focus would now turn to re-assembling the board, the statement said, and ""ensuring a successful Adelaide Festival... which safeguards the long and rich cultural legacy of our state.""
It added that it is ""committed to rebuilding trust with our artistic community"".
Abdel-Fattah has rejected the board's apology as ""disingenuous"". ""It is clear that the board's regret extends to how the message of my cancellation was conveyed, not the decision itself,"" she wrote in a post on Instagram.
""The Bondi shooting does not mean I or anyone else has to stop advocating for an end to the illegal occupation and systematic extermination of my people - that is an obscene and absurd demand,"" she added.
Her lawyer has sent a letter to the board demanding to know which of her past statements were used to justify the decision to uninvite her, and has told the BBC the writer is yet to decide whether to take any legal action.
Signing off her statement on Tuesday, Abdel-Fattah said she was ""exhausted"". ""Please remember that the genocide of Palestinians continues and that all of this is a smokescreen. I am not the story. Palestine is.""

Australian novelist Craig Silvey charged with child exploitation offences,2026-01-13T06:19:33.065Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","Prize-winning Australian author Craig Silvey has appeared in court charged with possessing and distributing child exploitation material.
Silvey, best known for his novel Jasper Jones, was arrested on Monday after police raided his home in Perth. Police alleged he was actively engaging with other child exploitation offenders online when they arrived.
The 43-year-old father of three did not enter a plea during his appearance in Fremantle Magistrates Court on Tuesday and was granted bail.
Jasper Jones is regarded as an Australian classic. It has sold more than half a million copies, is often a set text in schools and was made into a film starring Toni Collette in 2017.
The book won the Australian Book Industry Awards Book of the Year Award and was also shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Awards and the Miles Franklin Literary Award.
Another of his books, 2022 novel Runt, was also made into a film starring Celeste Barber.
The sequel, Runt and the Diabolical Dognapping, was launched at the end of last year and was Australia's number one ""best-selling children's book"" according to its publisher Allen & Unwin.
Silvey is to appear in court again on 10 February.

Pioneering gay footballer Josh Cavallo accuses former club of homophobia,2026-01-13T03:24:22.110Z," Tiffanie Turnbull
Sydney
","Joshua Cavallo - the first man to come out as gay while playing top-tier football - has alleged he was pushed out of his former club due to ""internal homophobia"".
Cavallo, who recently joined semi-professional English outfit Stamford AFC after leaving Adelaide United in May last year, made global headlines in 2021 when he came out with the support of his Australian club.
In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Cavallo alleged that the Adelaide United officials had afterwards sidelined him due to his sexuality, something a spokesperson for the club said it ""categorically rejects"".
""All on-field decisions relating to team selection are made solely on footballing grounds,"" the club's statement read.
In the Instagram post, Cavallo wrote that it had taken him a while to ""digest how my time at Adelaide United ended"" but said he was speaking out because fans deserve honesty.
""It's hard to swallow when I realised my own club was homophobic. I was angry because people thought I was sidelined based on injuries, when in reality, it was internal homophobia that kept me on the bench.""
A change in management meant ""politics"" kept him off the pitch and limited his career opportunities, Cavallo said, also alleging a photo of him and his partner was mocked by his teammates in a group chat.
""For the first time, I actually questioned if I should have kept my sexuality a secret.""
A spokesperson for Adelaide United - which is due to take part in its fourth Pride Cup match on Saturday - said it was ""extremely disappointed by the claims made"".
""Adelaide United has always been committed to fostering an inclusive environment for players, staff and supporters, and we remain proud of our ongoing work to promote inclusion across football.""
Cavallo has previously spoken about receiving death threats on a near daily basis after his decision to publicly come out, but has said that his only regret is not coming out sooner.
While former professional footballers or those in lower tiers have come out as gay before, Cavallo was the first to do so while actively playing in a premier league.
His 2021 revelation inspired Jake Daniels, who in 2022, at the age of 17, became the first British professional male footballer to come out in more than 30 years.

"Meta blocks 550,000 accounts under Australia's social media ban",2026-01-12T00:45:34.869Z," Tiffanie Turnbull
Sydney
","About 550,000 accounts were blocked by Meta during the first days of Australia's landmark social media ban for kids.
In December, a new law began requiring that the world's most popular social media sites - including Instagram and Facebook - stop Australians aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms.
The ban, which is being watched closely around the world, was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful content and algorithms.
Companies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online. However they continue to argue for other measures, with some experts raising similar concerns.
""We call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans,"" Meta said in a blog update.
The company said it blocked 330,639 accounts on Instagram, 173,497 on Facebook, and 39,916 on Threads during its first week of compliance with the new law.
They again put the argument that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.
""This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law.""
Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.
The policy is wildly popular with parents and envied by world leader, with the Tories this week pledging to follow suit if they win power at the next election, due before 2029.
However some experts have raised concerns that Australian kids can circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.
And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.

One person dead and 300 buildings destroyed in Australia bushfires,2026-01-11T14:18:04.832Z," Gabriela Pomeroy
","One person has died and 300 properties have been destroyed in bushfires that have torn across south-east Australia.
The fires have raged in dozens of locations across the country for several days, mostly in the state of Victoria, but also in New South Wales, burning through land almost twice the size of Greater London.
A state of emergency has been declared in Victoria as thousands of firefighters and more than 70 aircraft battle the blaze. Residents in more than a dozen communities have been advised to leave their homes.
Authorities fear the fires, which are being fuelled by very hot, dry and windy conditions, could burn for several weeks.
Victoria's Premier Jacinta Allan said 30 active fires were burning across the state, 10 of which were of particular concern.
She said 350,000 hectares had been burnt across the state as of 08:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT on Saturday).
""We will see fires continue for some time across the state and that is why we are not through the worst of this by a long way,"" she told Australian media.
""There are fires that are continuing right now that are threatening homes and property.""
Human remains were found in the village of Gobur, near the town of Longwood, some 110km (70 sq miles) north of the state capital Melbourne, police said. The victim has not yet been identified.
Allan praised the emergency workers who worked to retrieve the body. ""This is difficult and confronting work, and it takes a heavy toll.""
""The Gobur community is grieving,"" she said.
Bushfire smoke is impacting air quality in many areas across Victoria, including metropolitan Melbourne.
Authorities said the fires were the worst to hit the south-east of Australia since the 2019-2020 blazes that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people. Hundreds more are believed to have died due to the effects of the smoke which choked towns and cities that summer.
One of the worst-affected places is the small town of Harcourt in the central highlands of Victoria, where firefighter Tyrone Rice lost his own home in the blaze. He was out fighting one of the bushfires when he learned it was on fire.
He told Australian media it was ""like a kick in the guts, but I'm not the first person to go through it, and I won't be the last"".
The destruction in Harcourt was ""gut-wrenching"", local fire captain Andrew Wilson said.
A reporter for Australia's 9 News, Jack Ward, told the BBC World Service he had visited the damage in several towns across eastern Australia.
What he saw was ""catastrophic"", he said, and in many places, ""all that's left of these houses is a tin roof lying on the ground"".
While it is hard to link individual wildfires to climate change as how humans manage the land can play a factor, scientists say climate change is making the hot, dry weather conditions conducive to bush fires more common.

"'I feel free': Australia's social media ban, one month on",2026-01-09T21:45:00.697Z," Lana Lam
Sydney
","For the first time in years, Amy feels free.
One month since Australia's teen social media ban kicked in, she says she is ""disconnected from my phone"" and her daily routine has changed.
The 14-year-old first felt the pangs of online addiction in the days after the ban started.
""I knew that I was still unable to access Snapchat - however, from instinct, I still reached to open the app in the morning,"" she wrote on day two of the ban in a diary she kept for the first week afterwards.
By day four of the ban – when ten platforms including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok went dark for thousands of Australian children aged 16 and under – she had started to question the magnetic pull of Snapchat.
""While it's sad that I can't snap my friends, I can still text them on other platforms and I honestly feel kind of free knowing that I don't have to worry about doing my streaks anymore,"" Amy wrote.
Streaks - a Snapchat feature considered by some as highly addictive – require two people to send a ""snap"" – a photo or video – to each other every day in order to maintain their ""streak"" which can last for days, months, even years.
By day six, the allure of Snapchat - which she first downloaded when she was 12 and checked several times a day - was fading fast for Amy.
""I often used to call my friends on Snapchat after school, but because I am no longer able to, I went for a run,"" she wrote.
Fast forward a month, and her habits are markedly different.
""Previously, it was part of my routine to open Snapchat,"" the Sydney teen tells the BBC.
""Opening Snapchat would often lead to Instagram and then TikTok, which sometimes resulted in me losing track of time after being swept up by the algorithm ... I now reach for my phone less and mainly use it when I genuinely need to do something.""
Amy's experience is likely to put a smile on the face of Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who in the lead-up to the ban pleaded with kids to kick their social media habits.
The government has cited online bullying and protecting young people from online predators and harmful content as some of the reasons for the ban.
Since 10 December, tech companies risk being fined up to A$49.5m (US$32m, £25m) if they don't take ""reasonable steps"" to boot under-16s off their platforms.
But Albanese's hopes that the ban would usher in a new generation of sports-loving, book-reading, instrument-playing kids may have fallen flat for many.
Aahil, 13, hasn't read more books, played more sports or started learning an instrument.
Instead, he spends about two and a half hours on various social media platforms every day – the same as before the ban started.
He still has his YouTube and Snapchat accounts – both use fake birthdays - and spends most of his time on gaming platform Roblox and Discord, a messaging platform popular with gamers – neither of which are banned.
""It hasn't really changed anything,"" Aahil says, as most of his friends still have active social media accounts.
But his mum Mau has noticed a change.
""He's moodier,"" she says, adding he spends more time playing video games than before.
""When he was on social media, he was more social … more talkative with us,"" Mau says, though, she adds, his moodiness may also simply be the ""teenage years"".
Consumer psychologist Christina Anthony says moods might be due to the ban's short-term effects on emotion regulation.
""For many teenagers, social media isn't just entertainment - it's a tool for managing boredom, stress, and social anxiety, and for seeking reassurance or connection,"" she says.
""When access is disrupted, some young people may initially experience irritability, restlessness, or a sense of social disconnection… not because the platform itself is essential, but because a familiar coping mechanism has been removed.""
Over time, young people may adopt new coping strategies such as talking to trusted adults, she adds.
In another Sydney household, the ban has had little impact.
""My usage of social media is the same as prior to the ban because I made new accounts for both TikTok and Instagram with ages above 16 years old,"" says 15-year-old Lulu.
The new law has influenced her in other ways.
""I am reading a bit more because I don't want to be on social media as much.""
But she's not spending more times outdoors, nor is she arranging to meet friends face-to-face.
Instead, Lulu, along with Amy and Aahil, all started using WhatsApp and Facebook's Messenger more – neither are banned - because they couldn't contact friends who had lost access to their social media accounts.
This, Anthony says, goes to the heart of why social media is fun and engaging in the first place: it's social.
""The enjoyment doesn't come from scrolling alone, but from shared attention,"" she says, ""knowing that friends are seeing the same posts, reacting to them, and participating in the same conversations.""
When that ""emotional lift"" fades, the platform begins to feel ""oddly unsocial"".
""That's why some young people disengage even if they technically still have access…without peers present, both the social feedback and the mood payoff drop sharply.""
Seeking lookalike apps to fill the void was exactly what thousands of Australians did in the days before the ban started, with three little-known apps - Lemon8, Yope and Coverstar - surging in downloads.
This attraction to alternative photo and video-sharing platforms fits into what's known as compensatory behaviour, Anthony says.
""When a familiar and emotionally rewarding activity is restricted, people don't simply stop seeking that reward… they look for alternative ways to get it,"" she says.
""For teens, that often means compensating with platforms or activities that provide similar psychological benefits: social connection, identity expression, entertainment, or escapism.""
That initial rise has now dropped but daily downloads are still higher than usual, says Adam Blacker from Apptopia, a US-based company which tracks consumer trends of mobile apps.
The fall in downloads suggested ""a chunk of kids might be embracing the new rules and swapping their time spent on mobile for time spent elsewhere,"" Blacker says.
Amy was one of the thousands who downloaded Lemon8 - created by the makers behind TikTok - before the ban.
""This was largely influenced by social pressure and a fear of missing out as many people around me were doing the same,"" she says.
But she has never used it.
""Since then, my interest in social media has decreased significantly, and I don't feel any need to download or use alternative platforms.""
The number of Australians downloading virtual private networks – or VPNs – also increased before the ban, but has since fallen back to normal levels.
VPN technology allows users to hide their location and pretend they are based in another country, in effect, bypassing local laws.
But they have limited appeal to teens, Blacker says, because many social media platforms can detect VPNs.
""Teens can only leverage VPNs to create a new account,"" he says, so ""they would be starting over in terms of connections, settings, photos and more"".
In the months before the ban, debate swirled around the exclusion of gaming platforms, with critics concerned that many youngsters use them in the same way as social media, meaning they presented the same types of potential harms.
While there's no evidence yet on whether more teenagers have switched to the likes of Roblox, Discord and Minecraft to socialise, it's a real possibility, says Mark Johnson, an expert in gaming live stream platforms such as Twitch, which is part of the ban.
""But that's also contingent on a young person having the required hardware, the required cultural and technical knowledge, and so forth - games are much harder to get into, for the uninitiated, than social media sites,"" he says.
Johnson, who lectures in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, says the reaction to the ban has been mixed.
""A lot of parents seem to be reassured and pleased that their children and teenagers are spending far less time in social media,"" he says.
""Equally, some are lamenting the newfound difficulty their young people are having in communicating with their friends, and in some cases with family members who live elsewhere.""
A spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner says they will release their findings on how the ban is going - including the number of accounts that have been deactivated since 10 December - in the coming weeks.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Communications Minister Anika Wells says the ban is ""making a real difference"" and leaders across the globe are looking to mirror the Australian model.
""Delaying access to social media is giving young Australians three more years to build their community and identity offline, starting with spending more time with family and friends over the summer holidays,"" the spokesperson says.
For Amy, one of the unforeseen benefits came in the hours after the Bondi Beach shootings on 14 December when two gunmen killed 15 people and injured dozens at an event marking the Jewish celebration Hanukkah.
""After the Bondi Beach incident, I was glad that I had not spent too long on TikTok, as I would have likely been exposed to an overwhelming amount of negative information and potentially disturbing content,"" she wrote on 15 December.
She says her time spent on social media has halved since the ban and while TikTok and Instagram are still fun, not having Snapchat has been a gamechanger.
""Snapchat gives me the most notifications so that's usually what gets me on my phone and then everything happens after that,"" she says.
For Amy's mum Yuko, she's noticed her daughter seems content spending more time by herself.
""We're not entirely sure whether this shift is directly because of the ban or simply part of having a quieter holiday period,"" she says, with most Australian students on school holidays until the end of January.
""It's hard to say yet whether [the ban] will be a positive or negative change - only time will tell.""

Australians brace for 'property loss or worse' as bushfires destroy homes,2026-01-09T03:34:15.383Z," Lana Lam
Sydney
","Australians in Victoria have been warned they should prepare for ""property loss or worse"" as much of the country faces extreme heatwave conditions.
Temperatures on Friday and Saturday are forecast to hit record highs for most states and territories, with Victoria and South Australia in particular bracing for dangerous fire conditions due to strong winds and hot temperatures.
A total fire ban is in place in Victoria and all regions across the state were given a ""catastrophic"" or ""extreme"" fire danger rating.
""Victorians should brace themselves for more property loss or worse,"" Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer Jason Heffernan told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Friday.
""The conditions were extreme yesterday. They're catastrophic today,"" Heffernan said.
Temperatures in Melbourne are expected to hit 42C on Friday and while areas in north-west Victoria may reach 45C, a cool change is forecast in the south-west.
A bushfire near Longwood, central Victoria, has burnt through nearly 36,000 hectares, authorities said, with at least 20 homes in the small town of Ruffy destroyed.
Ruffy CFA captain George Noye said the town had been ""severely"" affected.
""The main street looks like a bomb's gone off, we've lost a school,"" he told the ABC.
""Some properties have lost everything. They've lost their livelihoods, they've lost their shearing sheds, livestock, just absolutely devastating.
""But thankfully, at the moment, no lives have been lost.""
A statement from Victoria's state control centre on Friday said the Longwood fire was ""incredibly dynamic, with the fire spreading in multiple directions"" and may spread further than initial estimates.
Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Bob Hill said three people - two adults and a child - remain unaccounted for in the Longwood area.
He said authorities spoke to them yesterday at their property, warning them to seek shelter as it was too late to evacuate. Fire officials returned later to find the home had burnt down but could not locate the three people.
""They may be safe, they may be alive, let's not get ahead of ourselves, but we are keeping an open mind,"" Hill said.
In the Australian Capital Territory, which includes the capital Canberra, a total fire ban was declared for the first time in six years.
Sydney will see the mercury rise up to 42C on Saturday, before dropping to around 26C by Sunday.
Another fire near Walwa, north-east Victoria, has burned through more than 17,000 hectares.
Heffernan urged all Victorians to be on high alert, not just those near active fires.
""That is how severe these conditions are at the moment, not only at the Longwood fire but across the state,"" he told the ABC.
""My message at the moment to Victorians is yes, we are talking about Longwood and Walwa, but we have many other fires that have started this morning in and around communities... I am expecting more as the day goes on.""
In South Australia, local fire authorities said they had battled a number of small fires across the state overnight and temperatures were expected to hit 46C in some areas.

Australia PM announces royal commission into Bondi shooting,2026-01-08T07:53:16.156Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a royal commission, the country's most powerful form of independent inquiry, into last month's shooting at Bondi Beach.
The attack targeting a Jewish festival left 15 people dead, making it one of the deadliest in the country's history.
Albanese had previously argued that reforms on gun ownership and hate speech, steps to tackle antisemitism and a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies offered the quickest response.
But following weeks of public pressure, he said on Thursday that a royal commission was the best way forward after he had taken ""the time to reflect"" and meet with the Jewish community.
""I've repeatedly said that our government's priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity,"" he told reporters in Canberra. ""It's clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this.""
Since the 14 December attack, the families of the victims, as well as a chorus of public figures, including lawyers, business people and athletes had led an almost daily campaign calling for him to reverse course and launch a royal commission.
A royal commission has broad powers to investigate, the ability to summon witnesses and compel agencies to produce documents. It can also offer legal protections to whistleblowers.
The commission will examine four key areas, Albanese said. They comprise:
investigating the ""nature and prevalence of antisemitism"" and its ""key drivers"" in Australia
making recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism
examining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attack
making any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremism
The prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April.
Former High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that ""this won't be a drawn-out process."" Previous royal commissions have taken years.
""This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,"" Albanese said.
Rumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community.
Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese's announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were ""serious concerns"" about her appointment, without specifying what they were.
Speaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was ""an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision"".
Addressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: ""It's one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she's the most qualified person we could possibly consider.""
He also added that the inquiry was not meant to ""provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East"".
""The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they're opposed to, that have nothing to do with them,"" Albanese said.
In the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme.
Albanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of ""aggravated hate speech"".
He previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report.
Her report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism.
Speaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government's decision was ""the right one and an important one"".
""It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy,"" she said.

Heatwave hits Australia as officials warn of 'catastrophic' fire risk,2026-01-08T04:08:38.720Z," Lana Lam
Sydney
","Parts of Australia will face catastrophic fire conditions on Friday, when heatwaves are expected to hit most of the country.
Severe to extreme heatwaves have been declared in every state and territory in Australia, except for Queensland, with high temperatures forecast for days.
The state of Victoria has declared a total fire ban for Friday, as the fire danger rating will be set at ""catastrophic"" - the highest level. Some 450 schools and childcare centres will be closed.
One meteorologist told the BBC that the combination of heatwaves and an elevated fire danger in parts of the country could create the most ""significant"" conditions since the devastating Black Summer bushfires.
On Thursday, firefighters battled several blazes in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), with a dozen planes carrying water called in to tackle a large fire near the city of Wodonga, the ABC reported.
Melbourne experienced its hottest day in six years on Wednesday with a high of 40.9C (105.6F), while some coastal towns in Western Australia hit 49C.
In NSW, the heatwave is expected to peak on Saturday with Sydney facing a high of 42C while areas of South Australia and Western Australia will see temperatures over 40C in the coming days.
Friday will be the ""real peak of the current burst of heat,"" Angus Hines from the Bureau of Meteorology told the BBC.
""It will be a very hot day for almost all of South Australia, Victoria, most of New South Wales, parts of Tasmania"".
Wednesday was the first significant heatwave for Melbourne and Adelaide, where millions of people live, with fire conditions set to worsen on Friday, he said.
""Firstly, the winds are strengthening across Victoria tomorrow,"" Hines said, adding that coupled with possible thunderstorms with little rain and dry lightning strikes, the fire danger will hit catastrophic levels for the northern parts of Victoria.
""This looks like the most significant event at a multi-day level for inland south-east Australia since 2019-2020,"" Hines said.
That period six years ago saw Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called Black Summer where dozens of people died and tens of millions of hectares of land was burnt.
In Victoria, authorities on Thursday warned that a catastrophic fire danger rating means potential blazes can be ""unpredictable and uncontrollable"".
""We need the community to play their role alongside our emergency services to protect lives and property,"" said Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch.
""Prepare now and enact your bushfire survival plan. If you are in an area of forecast catastrophic fire danger, leave early to an area with a lower fire risk.""
Australia's fire danger ratings scale has four levels, with catastrophic being the highest level, followed by extreme, high and moderate.
A heatwave is declared when the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to be unusually high for three days of more.

Sydney sends message of peace for New Year's after Bondi attack,2025-12-31T15:24:36.004Z," Hafsa KhalilandHarry Sekulich
Sydney
","Sydney has welcomed the New Year with a message of peace following the Bondi Beach mass shooting, as huge crowds gathered to watch the city's annual fireworks display.
The words peace and unity were projected onto the Sydney Harbour Bridge, as thousands of heavily armed police officers patrolled the streets - a rare and stark sight in Australia - as part of heightened security measures.
New South Wales (NSW) Police said more than 2,500 officers were on duty across the city, and some officers were authorised to carry high-grade weapons.
The attack on 14 December targeted Australia's Jewish community and killed 15 people at a Hanukkah festival.
Follow live coverage from New Year's celebrations around the world
The Sydney Harbour Bridge was lit up by a white light to symbolise peace, and a Jewish menorah was projected on to the pylons of the bridge to show solidarity with the Jewish community.
Official New Year's Eve parties were paused at 23:00 local time (12:00 GMT) for a minute's silence to commemorate the victims of the attack.
Pictures from Sydney Harbour - where thousands gather every year to watch the famous fireworks display - showed officers patrolling the crowds with longarm weapons.
In the lead up to the event, Premier Chris Minns had warned that some people may find the sight ""confronting"", with police ""carrying firearms and weapons that you haven't seen before"".
""But I don't make any apology for that. We want people to be safe in our community,"" he added.
British tourists Joe and Lucy said the increased police presence reassured them.
The pair - who timed their Australia trip to coincide with the fireworks - were in Melbourne when the shooting occurred.
""We had our worries about coming for New Year's Eve,"" Joe told the BBC, adding, ""but we were reading more recently in the news... how more police were going to be here, it would be a bit safer"".
Separately, Minns had urged Sydneysiders to not let the ""horrible criminal terrorist event"" at Bondi change the way they live, as he called on people to ""show defiance"" and celebrate the new year.
This sentiment was shared by some of the spectators.
Out among the crowds at Barangaroo's Observatory Hill, a close spot to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, was Hélène from Belgium.
She told the BBC people ""cannot live in fear"" following the attack.
Hours ahead of the countdown, hundreds of thousands of people flocked towards the harbour, with many official viewing areas filling to capacity by early evening.
On the harbour, sailboats dotted the water - one of the best spots to watch the midnight fireworks display.
Sydney's celebration - with its iconic fireworks display - kicked off a chain of events, from Dubai, to London and New York.

Passengers on stranded cruise ship to be flown back to Australia,2025-12-30T05:36:46.447Z," Tiffany Wertheimer
","Passengers aboard a cruise ship that ran aground in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on Saturday will be flown back to Australia, after efforts to refloat the vessel failed.
The Australian-flagged Coral Adventurer became stuck on a reef off the eastern coast of PNG at around 05:25 local time on Saturday.
The 80 passengers and 44 crew members are safe and unharmed, and the passengers who departed from Cairns in northern Australia on 18 December, will be flown back there.
The same ship made headlines earlier this year when it left behind an elderly woman on a remote island on the Great Barrier Reef. Her body was found the following day, and an investigation is ongoing.
In the latest incident, the Coral Adventurer was transiting through Morobe, Madang and Sepik provinces when it hit strong sea currents and sailed onto the reef, Morobe's Police Commander Chief Superintendent Samson Siguyaru told the ABC's Pacific Beat programme.
The ship was on a six-degree list to the port side - meaning it was tilting to the left, the NMSA said. After inspections, authorities determined that the vessel was not damaged, and there was no environmental pollution or spillage.
However a detention notice has been issued, Ch Supt Siguyaru said, which means the ship has been deemed unseaworthy - at least temporarily - and is not allowed to leave the location ""until all the processes are cleared"".
Attempts on Sunday to free the ship by using its own engines and a tug boat were unsuccessful, PNG authorities told the ABC. A larger tugboat from Lae, PNG's second largest city, had been sent and was expected to try towing the boat on Tuesday, they said.
The ship's operator, Coral Expeditions, said on Monday that it would end the tour a day early and fly passengers back to Australia, the public broadcaster reported.
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it had also begun an investigation into the incident while the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said it had detained the vessel ""based on reasonable suspicion that it is not seaworthy due to potential damage sustained during the grounding"".
According to its website, Coral Expeditions has been running tours to PNG for about 20 years.
Morobe's provincial governor, Rainbo Paita, told the ABC that the vessel took a route not usually used by local operators because the reef is known to be ""very high there"".
Coral Expeditions has been contacted for comment.

Bondi hero says he wanted to stop gunman killing innocent people,2025-12-29T05:47:02.552Z," Lana Lam
Sydney
","The man who disarmed one of the gunmen who killed 15 people at a Jewish event at Bondi Beach has revealed his thoughts in the moments before his heroic actions.
In verified footage, Ahmed al Ahmed - a Sydney shop owner born and raised in Syria - tackled one of the two shooters from behind, wrestling a long-arm gun from him.
""I hold him with my right hand and start saying a word, you know, like to warn him - 'drop your gun, stop doing what you're doing',"" the father-of-two told the BBC's US partner CBS News in an exclusive interview.
Mr Ahmed, who was shot several times by the other alleged gunman, said his actions saved ""lots of people... but I feel sorry still for the lost.""
In the interview, Mr Ahmed recalled the moment he tackled Sajid Akram, 50, who was shooting attendees at a Hanukkah event at Bondi Beach on Sunday 14 December.
""My target was just to take the gun from him, and to stop him from killing a human being's life and not killing innocent people.""
Fifteen people died during the attack - Australia's deadliest mass shooting since 1996 - and 40 others were injured. Police have declared the attack a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.
Sajid Akram was shot dead by police while his son Naveed, the other alleged gunman who was hospitalised after the attack, has since been charged with 59 offences including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist attack.
Mr Ahmed described the inner thoughts running through his head in the lead-up to his actions, which authorities and politicians have said saved countless lives.
""Emotionally, I'm doing something, which is I feel something, a power in my body, my brain,"" Mr Ahmed said.
""I don't want to see people killed in front of me, I don't want to see blood, I don't want to hear his gun, I don't want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help.
""That's my soul asking me to do that.""
In the days after the shooting, Mr Ahmed was presented with a cheque at his hospital bedside for A$2.5m (£1.24m; $1.7m) which had been raised from tens of thousands of community members moved by his actions.
He was shot several times in the shoulder after tackling Sajid Akram and required at least three operations.
Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Mr Ahmed in hospital, describing him as ""the best of our country"" while New South Wales Premier Chris Minns called him a ""real-life hero"".
Earlier, Mr Ahmed's parents told BBC Arabic that their son was ""driven by his sentiment, conscience and humanity"".

"Australian man charged after endorsing Bondi attack had weapons stockpile, police say",2025-12-24T08:38:14.559Z," Tiffanie Turnbull
","Police located several guns, a stockpile of ammunition and a shopping list for bomb materials in the home of a Western Australian man arrested after pledging support for the Bondi attackers, a court has heard.
Martin Glynn, 39, appeared in a Perth court on Wednesday charged with racial harassment, possessing a prohibited weapon and failing to store firearms correctly.
Prosecutors allege flags of Hamas and Hezbollah, both declared terrorist groups by Australia, were located during a police raid sparked by a tip-off from the public.
In a statement, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said ""there is no place in Australia for antisemitism, hate and violent ideologies"".
The court heard that Mr Glynn posted on Instagram just hours after two gunmen killed 15 people in a targeted attack on a Hanukkah event at Sydney's Bondi Beach on 14 December to endorse their actions.
""A community member saw a post from the man online, recognised it wasn't right, and reported it to police,"" acting Western Australia premier Rita Saffioti told reporters on Christmas Eve.
Police subsequently searched Mr Glynn's home in Yangebup, a suburb of Perth, allegedly finding a notebook including antisemitic comments and references to Nazi ideology.
Three flags, six rifles and around 4,000 rounds of ammunition were also seized, prosecutors say.
There is ""nothing illegal or improper"" with supporting the Palestinian cause, Magistrate Benjamin Tyers told the court on Wednesday.
""What is not proper is posting online comments supporting a massacre of innocent civilians,"" he said, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.
In court, Mr Glynn, who represented himself, said he had been ""opinionated"" about the war in Gaza, but was ""hoping to raise the hypocrisy"" by creating the Instagram post.
He said he was a doomsday prepper, and that the alleged ""bomb-making material"" was actually fire-starting material.
""I don't intended to harm anyone,"" he said.
Western Australia Police Commissioner Col Blanch told media it is early days in their investigation, but there was no previous ""record of concern for this individual"".
Mr Glynn, a former mine worker, was denied bail and will face court again on 3 February.
His arrest comes as the state of New South Wales passed new gun control laws after a marathon debate which ended at about 03:00 local time on Wednesday (16:00 GMT Tuesday).
The new laws, drafted in response to the Bondi shootings, tightens regulations on who can own guns and gives police more powers to ban street protests.

Australia to deport British man charged with displaying Nazi symbols,2025-12-24T00:25:04.123Z," Lana Lam
Sydney
","A British national in Australia has had his visa cancelled and faces deportation for allegedly displaying Nazi symbols.
The 43-year-old man living in Queensland was arrested and charged earlier this month, after allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community.
The man was taken into immigration detention this week in Brisbane and is due to face court in January. Police have been cracking down on the use of prohibited symbols amid a recent rise in antisemitism and right-wing extremism.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: ""He came here to hate - he doesn't get to stay.""
""If you come to Australia on a visa, you are here as a guest,"" Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Wednesday.
Last month, Burke also revoked the visa of Matthew Gruter, a South African national who had been living in Australia since 2022, after he was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally in front of the New South Wales parliament.
Like Gruter, the British man can appeal his visa being revoked. He can leave Australia voluntarily or wait to be deported to his home country.
It is understood police are assessing whether to delay deporting the man so he can face court next month.
The BBC has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment.
Earlier this year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute.
Police began investigating the British man in October over alleged posts on X. The social media platform blocked his account, prompting him to create a new one with a similar name where he continued posting offensive and harmful content, police said.
Authorities searched the man's home in Caboolture, on the outskirts of Brisbane, in late November and seized phones, weapons and several swords with swastika symbols.
He was charged with three counts of displaying banned Nazi symbols and one count of using the internet to cause offense.
""We want to ensure these symbols are not being used to fracture social cohesion,"" Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Stephen Nutt said earlier this month.
""If we identify instances where this is happening, we will act swiftly to disrupt the behaviour, prosecute those involved and protect the dignity, safety and cohesion of our diverse community.""

Sydney
","A young police officer who was shot in the head during the Bondi Beach attack has been released from hospital.
Probationary Constable Jack Hibbert - who is just four months into the job - was patrolling a Hanukkah event when two gunmen opened fire, injuring over 40 people and killing 15.
The 22-year-old, who was also hit in the shoulder, has lost vision in one of his eyes but is now recovering at home, his family confirmed in a statement.
""As a family, we couldn't ask for anything more - having our Jack home, especially for Christmas, truly feels like a miracle.""
They thanked the public for their ""overwhelming support"" and praised medical staff for their ""exceptional"" care and dedication.
""While he is home, he is still recovering and will need space, support, and continued positive thoughts during this time,"" the statement added.
Even after he was shot during the attack, Constable Hibbert continued to help festival attendees until he physically could no longer do so, his family previously said.
""Many of his colleagues who were present on the night of the incident have visited in hospital and given testaments to Jack's bravery during the incident... They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger,"" they said.
He was one of two police officers injured in the shooting, with the second officer Constable Scott Dyson, 25, still recovering from his injuries in hospital, according to the last police update.
Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon visited Constable Hibbert in hospital, praising him as a ""positive young man"".
Lanyon added that the force would rally around Constable Hibbert and find ""appropriate duties for him"" after his recovery.
Police have alleged the suspected gunmen were inspired by Islamic State ideology and targeted the Jewish festival in what has been declared a terror attack.
Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of terror. A second gunman - his father, Sajid Akram - was shot dead by police at the scene.
On Monday, new court documents alleged the pair ""meticulously"" planned the attack for months, and two days prior to the shooting, visited Bondi for reconnaissance.

","The suspected gunmen in the Bondi Beach attack threw explosives at the start of the deadly incident and had practised shooting weeks before, according to new court documents.
They allege the pair ""meticulously"" planned the attack for months and, two days prior to the shooting, visited Bondi for reconnaissance.
Fifteen people were killed and dozens more injured when two gunmen opened fire on a Hanukkah celebration on 14 December. Explosives, including a ""tennis ball bomb"", failed to detonate, the documents said.
Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of terror. A second gunman - his father, Sajid Akram - was shot dead by police at the scene.
Last week, a temporary suppression order was made on the release of the police fact sheet to protect the identities of the survivors. It was revoked on Monday and the documents were published with some redactions.
Included in the new court documents are the details of several videos tracing the movements of the alleged gunmen in the months, days and hours before the attack.
One video - taken on one of their mobile phones in October - is described as showing the men sitting in front of an image of an Islamic State group (IS) flag.
They are heard making statements about their motivations for the attack and condemn ""the acts of 'Zionists'"", police say.
Naveed Akram is also ""recorded appearing to recite, in Arabic, a passage from the Quran"".
Police said separate footage from October shows the father and son ""conducting firearms training in a countryside location"", believed to be in New South Wales. They are seen ""firing shotguns and moving in a tactical manner"", officials added.
CCTV footage from the evening of 12 December is said to show two males ""believed to be the accused and his father"" in their car next to Bondi Beach.
""The accused and his father, S Akram, are seen to exit the vehicle and walk along the footbridge, being the same position where they attended two days later and shot at members of the public,"" the document states.
""Police allege that this is evidence of reconnaissance and planning of a terrorist act.""
At around 02:00 (15:00 GMT) on the day of the attack, two men were captured on CCTV leaving rented accommodation in the Sydney suburb of Campsie ""carrying long and bulky items wrapped in blankets"", which they placed into a car.
The documents note these include two single barrel shotguns, a Beretta rifle, four improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and two IS flags.
Police say shortly after 17:00 (08:00 GMT), the men were seen leaving the rental. Separate footage captures them arriving at Bondi at 18:50 (09:50 GMT), where they parked and placed the flags on the inside of the front and rear windows.
They are then seen removing the firearms and IEDs from the car, before walking towards a footbridge, according to the documents.
It was from this location that police believe they threw the explosives - three pipe bombs and a ""tennis ball bomb"" - towards the crowd, though none exploded.
A short time later, they used the firearms to shoot towards the crowd, police say. Fourteen people were killed at the scene. One other died from their injuries later in hospital.
Sajid Akram was shot and killed during an exchange of fire with New South Wales Police officers.
Naveed Akram was critically injured by police fire. He was released from hospital on Monday and transferred to a prison.
In the week since the shooting, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been accused by the Jewish community of not taking antisemitic threats seriously enough.
On Sunday, he was booed by sections of a crowd at a memorial event attended by tens of thousands of people.
He apologised to Jewish Australians and promised to ""work every day"" to protect them. He also proposed to push for new legislation against extremism and hate speech.
But Albanese may face an even greater problem as questions mount over the handling of intelligence on the alleged gunmen and whether it was thoroughly pursued.
It was previously reported that Naveed Akram was investigated over ties to a Sydney-based IS terrorism cell.
Albanese had said he first came to the attention of the authorities in 2019, but an ""assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence"".
Additional questions are being asked as to why - in light of this previous investigation - the father and son were able to travel to the Philippines in the month before the attack, and how the father was able to buy guns. At a news conference on Monday, NSW Premier Chris Minns said he did not want to speculate and an investigation was ongoing.
There is also growing pressure for Albanese to call a Royal Commission, Australia's highest level of public inquiry, into the Bondi terror attack, with calls coming from the Jewish community and MPs.
The attack has also sparked calls for tougher restrictions on gun ownership. On Monday, New South Wales state recalled its parliament to debate a raft of new gun and protest laws, proposed in the wake of the shooting.
Some civil rights groups and pro-gun advocates have raised concerns that the laws will place undue restrictions on firearms and protests.
Minns said some may feel the changes had ""gone too far"" but they were needed to keep the community safe.

Australian move to fast-track new gun and protest laws after Bondi shooting draws criticism,2025-12-22T06:14:56.995Z," Lana Lam
Sydney
","Civil rights groups and pro-gun advocates in Australia have raised concerns that new fast-tracked laws will place undue restrictions on firearms and protests in the wake of the Bondi shootings.
On Monday, the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) recalled its parliament to debate a raft of new laws such as banning the phrase ""globalise the intifada"", limiting the number of guns one person can own, and greater police powers for protests.
NSW Premier Chris Minns said some may feel the changes had ""gone too far"" but they were needed to keep the community safe.
A pro-gun politician said the laws unfairly target law-abiding gun owners while civil libertarians said restrictions on protests were an affront to democracy.
On banning the ""intifada"" phrase, Minns said its use at protests in Australia and around the world ""are a call to a global intifada. That is what it means. Not in the Middle East, not in Israel or Gaza but here in Sydney"".
""I do believe it leads to a culture and environment of heightened disunity,"" he said, and ""an invitation to violence"".
The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.
Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.
In the aftermath of the Bondi attacks, in which 15 people were killed, the Jewish community accused the government of not doing enough to protect it from rising antisemitism.
The new protest laws will also allow police to restrict demonstrations at places of worship, with stronger penalties for breaches.
Timothy Roberts, president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, said the new law ignores a recent decision by the state's supreme court which found the so-called ""move-on power"" at religious locations went against Australia's implied constitutional freedom of political communication.
Religious institutions exercise significant and overt political power in Australian politics and this makes them a legitimate site of protest in a democratic society, Mr Roberts said.
""The laws introduced today are an affront to our right to assemble and communicate with each other,"" he said, adding they ""damage our democracy"".
He said Minns wants social cohesion but he does not know the meaning of the term.
""He thinks silence is peace, and does not seem to realise it can also reflect oppression. Passing laws that oppress some parts of our community in the wake of an attack like we saw, does not bring us closer - it drives us further apart and stops us from healing well in this time of grief.""
Police will also be able to remove face coverings from protesters who are suspected of committing an offence - including low-level offences - during a protest.
Previously, police could only do so if someone is arrested or suspected of committing an indictable offence.
On gun reform, the new laws will mean licence holders in NSW cannot own more than four firearms with exceptions for farmers and sport shooters who can have up to ten.
The move follows similar laws introduced in Western Australia earlier this year to cap gun ownership. Elsewhere across the country, there are no limits.
One of the gunmen in the Bondi shooting, Sajid Akram, had six registered firearms.
Other gun law changes include more regular renewals for gun licence holders from every five years to every two years, and a review of the types of firearms available to most gun owners.
Mark Banasiak from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party - which lobbies for more relaxed gun laws - said the state's 260,000 gun licence holders were being ""punished"" and ""made a scapegoat for agency failings"".
""We're diverting away from what the real problem is,"" he said, referring to ""a climate of hate and division that's been allowed to fester for two and a half years because government haven't done enough to stop that.""
Walter Mikac, whose wife and two young daughters were among the 35 people shot dead in Tasmania by a lone gunman in 1996 in what is Australia's deadliest mass shooting, welcomed the reforms.
The changes will ""close critical gaps in our gun laws"" and put community safety first, he said.
The government also aims to crackdown on hate speech and symbols, as well as enabling police to ban protests for up to three months after a terrorist attack.
Palestine Action Group spokesperson Josh Lees said the new laws were ""incredibly draconian"".
""Australia is seen as a safe country,"" he said, ""where freedom of speech is very important"" but the Bondi shooting was ""perhaps changing the dynamics of that democracy and that freedom"".
David Ossip, president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said moves to ban ""intifada"" chants was a ""watershed moment"" in confronting hate and incitement.
He also welcomed greater police powers during protests.
""The right to protest is a core Australian value and a fundamental tenet of a democratic society,"" he said.
""But it has never included the right to hide your face and shout slogans calling for violence against one's fellow Australians or waving the flags of groups devoted to murder and destruction.""

","Mourners in Australia fell silent on Sunday in honour of the victims of the Bondi Beach attack.
The memorial was part of a national day of reflection to mark a week since the shooting in which two gunmen opened fire on an event celebrating the Jewish festival of Hannukah.
A 10-year-old girl, a British-born rabbi and a Holocaust survivor were among 15 people killed in the attack.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was booed when he arrived at the memorial event - an expression of anger by Australia's Jewish community against his government after a rise of antisemitic attacks over the past few months.
As the sun set over Sydney on Sunday evening, a minute's silence was observed at 18:47 (07:47 GMT) - exactly one week since the first reports of gunfire at the famous beach.
There was heavy security at the memorial event. Some cordoned-off areas were guarded by armed riot squad officers who had their faces covered, while a police patrol boat was visible off the coast of Bondi Beach.
For many Australians, this level of security is an unfamiliar sight.
A large crowd - many wearing kippas, the Jewish skullcap, or draped in Australian flags - gathered to listen to speeches after the observing the silence.
Bee balloons floated in the wind in honour of the youngest victim of the attack, Matilda, who was nicknamed ""Matilda Bee"".
Later in the ceremony, the crowd sang Waltzing Matilda, the song the 10-year-old was named after.
Soon after, the crowd chanted the name of another child - Chaya, a 14-year-old who put herself in the firing line to protect a stranger's children.
Shot in the leg, she used crutches to take to the stage.
""If you guys get inspired by one thing, one thing on all this, be the light in that field of darkness,"" she said.
The event ended with the lighting of the menorah - something the crowds gathered for Hannukah last week couldn't do.
But Sunday's memorial was not limited to Bondi Beach or the state of New South Wales.
In a nation-wide gesture of ""light over darkness"", the windowsills of countless homes across Australia were lined with candles.
As Albanese arrived for the ceremony, one person in the crowd shouted: ""Blood on your hands.""
The prime minister looked startled at the hostility and his wife Jodie Haydon grasped his arm in support.
At least one member of the crowd was tackled by police after moving towards the prime minister.
The Jewish community in Australia has repeatedly said this attack was a shock but not a surprise after a rise in antisemitic attacks in Australia since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and the subsequent military retaliation war launched by Israel in the Gaza Strip.
The overwhelming view is that more could and should have been done to prevent the Sydney attack from happening.
Albanese has acknowledged the criticism, saying: ""I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia.""
More widely, Albanese has been accused by some of siding with the Palestinians over supporting Israel.
The relationship worsened when he moved to recognise the state of Palestine earlier this year.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused him - as well as the leaders of other countries that have recognised a Palestinian state - of rewarding Hamas.
After the Bondi Beach attack last Sunday, Netanyahu said Albanese's government ""did nothing to stop the spread of antisemitism in Australia"".
In contrast to the reception for the Australian prime minister, Chris Minns, the Premier of New South Wales, was praised at the Sydney memorial service as an exemplary leader, partly for the speed with which he admitted government errors in the lead-up to the attack.
He also attended the funerals of several victims this week. Albanese was not invited to some.
""We are deeply sorry,"" Minns said at the event.
""We grieve with you, and with humility, I acknowledge that the government's highest duty is to protect its citizens. And we did not do that one week ago.""
The shooting had ""highlighted a deep vein of antisemitic hate in our community"", Minns said, adding: ""This must be confronted.""
The president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, David Ossip, was hailed with loud cheers as he called for a ""Royal Commission which goes beyond New South Wales, to get to the bottom of how this catastrophe took place"".

Suspected gunman Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.
Days after the attack, Albanese announced a raft of measures to crack down on hate speech and incitement to violence.
Shortly before Sunday's ceremony, he announced a review into the police and national intelligence agencies.
""The ISIS-inspired atrocity last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation,"" Albanese said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.
He has also said he will reform gun laws and the government has launched a gun buyback scheme - the largest since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, which left 35 people dead and prompted Australia to introduce world-leading gun control measures.

","Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a review into the police and national intelligence agencies after the Bondi Beach attack in Sydney.
""The ISIS-inspired atrocity last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation,"" Albanese said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. ""Our security agencies must be in the best position to respond.""
The shooting, in which 15 people were killed after two gunmen opened fire at a Jewish festival, has been declared a terrorist incident. Police say the attackers were inspired by ""Islamic State ideology"".
A national day of reflection is being held on Sunday.
A minute's silence was observed at 18:47 (07:47 GMT) - the time when the attack began.
Albanese looked startled as he arrived at the event in Sydney as he was met with a loud chorus of boos and jeers.
At least one member of the crowd shouted ""blood on your hands"" while another was tackled by police after moving towards the prime minister.
Albanese was steered towards a VIP seating area and his wife Jodie Haydon grasped his arm in support.
The Jewish community in Australia has repeatedly said this attack was a shock, not a surprise. The overwhelming view is that more could and should have been done to prevent it from happening.
They have accused Albanese of siding with the Palestinians over supporting Israel and the relationship worsened when he moved to recognise the state of Palestine earlier this year.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Albanese - as well as the leaders of other countries that have recognised a Palestinian state - of rewarding Hamas, the group responsible for the deadliest attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.
After the Bondi Beach attack last Sunday, Netanyahu said Albanese's government ""did nothing to stop the spread of antisemitism in Australia"".
The Australian prime minister denies the accusation.
The prime minister earlier said the intelligence review, due by April 2026, would focus on ensuring authorities were equipped to tackle extremism.
He said: ""The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet will examine whether federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the right powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe in the wake of the horrific antisemitic Bondi Beach terrorist attack.""
In the wake of Australia's deadliest mass shooting in almost three decades, the government has also announced plans to tighten gun controls, while the New South Wales premier is pushing to crack down on hate speech.
Suspected gunman Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.
Earlier on Sunday, Governor-General Samantha Mostyn addressed a vigil held in Bondi, hosted by the National Council of Jewish Women Australia, where attendees largely wore white to symbolise peace.
""The entire Jewish community, whether it's here in Bondi or across our nation, you are part of the belonging story and the success of this country,"" she said.
Australians across the country are still reeling and there's a sense of shock and disbelief that something like this could have happened.
But this weekend, normality returned in some ways. Bondi promenade was once again filled with surfers, runners and dog-walkers returning to their regular routine.
While a sombre mood lingers, children's surf club activities - known locally as ""nippers"" - resumed on Sunday as a sign of the community showing resilience.
North Bondi's Surf Life Saving president Steve Larnach told the BBC they had considered cancelling the regular nippers events.
""We were also aware of the sensitivity towards our Jewish community,"" Larnach said.
""We did ask their opinion, they were very supportive of us going ahead but also extremely grateful for what we did.""
Lifeguard volunteers were among the first on the scene at the shooting last week providing first aid, Larnach added.
Some surf lifesavers have been hailed as heroes, including one who was photographed sprinting from a neighbouring beach with a red first aid kit slung over his shoulder.
Geraldine Nordfeldt, who brought her daughter to nippers, said ""it was really important to return to whatever this new normal is as soon as we could"".
""You have to return, you can't stay away, you can't let fear win. The beach is the Australian way of life and we all love it,"" she told the BBC.

Australian state plans to ban intifada chants after Bondi shooting,2025-12-20T07:20:49.805Z," Harry Sekulich
","The Australian state where the Bondi shooting occurred plans to ban the phrase ""globalise the intifada"" as part of a crackdown on ""hateful"" slogans.
New South Wales (NSW) premier Chris Minns has also called for a Royal Commission into the Bondi attack, marking the deadliest shooting in Australia in nearly 30 years.
Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured last Sunday when two gunmen, believed to have been motivated by ""Islamic State ideology"", opened fire on a Jewish festival at the country's most iconic beach.
Australia's state and federal governments have announced a raft of measures to counter extremism since the attack.
Minns plans to recall the state parliament next week to pass through stricter hate speech and gun restrictions. Earlier this week, he also suggested he would tighten protest laws to scale back mass demonstrations to encourage ""a summer of calm"".
The premier confirmed he would seek to classify the chant ""globalise the intifada"" as hate speech.
Two pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly shouting slogans involving intifada at a demonstration in central London.
The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.
Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.
Earlier this week, Minns, along with the NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane, attended the funeral Matilda, 10, who was the youngest victim of the Bondi shooting. He read out a poem dedicated to the young girl at the event.
Prime minister Anthony Albanese has announced a new gun buyback scheme to purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms. Hundreds of thousands of guns will be collected and destroyed, the government predicts.
Around 1,000 lifeguards staged a tribute on Saturday, lining up arm-to-arm facing the ocean, on the shorelines of Bondi beach. Surf lifesaving teams at other beaches around Australia were photographed performing a similar memorial.
Through the week, Bondi's surf volunteers have been commemorated as some of the heroes of the shooting. Lifeguard Jackson Doolan was photographed sprinting over from a neighbouring beach during the attack carrying a red medical supply bag.
Hundreds of swimmers and surfers paddled out at Bondi beach yesterday to create a giant circle to pay tribute to the victims of the attack.
On Sunday, Australia will hold a national day of reflection with the theme ""light over darkness"" marking precisely one week after the attack started with a minute's silence at 6:47 pm (0747 GMT).
Flags will fly at half-mast and Australians are being asked to light a candle in their windows to honour the victims.
""Sixty seconds carved out from the noise of daily life, dedicated to 15 Australians who should be with us today,"" prime minister Albanese told reporters Saturday.
""It will be a moment of pause to reflect and affirm that hatred and violence will never define us as Australians.""
Bondi's attack was Australia's worst mass shooting since Port Arthur in 1996, where 35 people were killed and prompted then-prime minister John Howard to introduce strict gun control measures.
"
Australia was seen as a world leader in gun control - Bondi has exposed a more complicated reality,2025-12-19T19:04:13.347Z," Lana Lam
Sydney
","It was a Sunday afternoon in April 1996 when a lone gunman armed with semi-automatic rifles killed 35 people in the Australian tourist town of Port Arthur.
The massacre almost 30 years ago, which ushered in some of the strictest gun laws in the world, feels like a bygone age for many Australians.
But the Bondi Beach attack on Sunday, which left 15 dead, rekindled memories of the Tasmanian tragedy - none more so than for leading gun control advocate Roland Browne.
As the country's deadliest modern-day mass shooting was unfolding an hour's drive away, Mr Browne was meeting fellow gun control advocates at his home, ahead of a government meeting, to lobby for a ban on the exact type of firearm the Port Arthur gunman was using.
Mr Browne, 66, was again at home in Hobart on Sunday when he received news of the shooting at Bondi, targeting a Jewish event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.
""There's just a lot of similarities,"" Mr Browne, who spent childhood summers in Bondi and still has family there, told the BBC.
""They're both very public places frequented by tourists from around the nation and around the world.""
""It's sickening and I'm bitterly disappointed in our political system whereby the voices for tighter gun laws and public health aren't listened to until there's a major event like this,"" he added.
For decades, Australia has stood as a beacon on the world stage for its strict gun laws, he says, taking a similar path to the UK which experienced its own mass shooting in Dunblane, just one month before Port Arthur.
Even now, Mr Browne remains friends with relatives of some of the 17 victims - mostly children aged five and six - killed at a primary school in Scotland.
But despite being praised for its stringent gun laws, the reality in Australia is not clear-cut.
A report by the Australia Institute earlier this year revealed that there are more than four million privately-owned firearms across the country - almost double the number from about 20 years ago.
That equates to one gun for every seven Australians, the report says.
Queensland has the most registered guns, followed by New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria while Tasmania and the Northern Territory have the most guns per person.
The report also dispels a common view that guns are mainly owned by rural residents.
Guns are widespread in metropolitan and suburban areas, with one in three firearms in NSW located in major cities, the report said.
The total figure has risen at a lower rate than population increases, but there are now more guns in fewer hands, with every licence holder owning an average of more than four firearms.
And that's one of the key issues that Mr Browne wants the government to address.
Currently, only one jurisdiction - Western Australia - has a cap on the number of legal firearms that a licence holder can have. Under new laws introduced in March this year, gun owners can have between five and ten firearms, depending on the type of licence and model of firearm.
Authorities have confirmed that one of the alleged gunmen, Sajid Akram who was killed at the scene of the Bondi attack, owned six registered guns.
Mr Browne wants a cap of one to three guns, depending on the licence category, to be introduced across Australia.
But Tom Kenyon, chief executive of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, argues that a cap would be meaningless.
""Limiting the number of guns wouldn't have made a difference on Sunday,"" he says.
""And it wouldn't have changed the fact that an attack occurred because those two individuals had been radicalised.""
Mr Kenyon argues that people intent on harm, without access to guns, will use other weapons, referencing the 2016 Bastille Day massacre in the French city of Nice where 86 people were killed after a man drove a truck into crowds during fireworks celebrations. The attack was claimed by Islamic State (IS).
The other alleged Bondi gunman, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was previously investigated over links to IS, according to comments made by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
Mr Kenyon also says that more guns are found in cities because most people in Australia live in metropolitan areas and travel to other areas to hunt.
Gun control laws in Australia are not uniform across the country, with inconsistent implementation of the rules across states and territories.
But generally, to apply for a gun licence, you must be over 18, a ""fit and proper person"", pass a training and safety course and give a ""genuine reason"" for having a firearm.
The eight accepted reasons include recreational hunting or pest control, target or sport shooting, for work (such as security guards and prison officers), for use in farming or animal welfare and firearms collectors.
But there are loopholes.
For example, anyone under 18 was meant to be barred from owning a firearm under the 1996 gun control reforms, but minors in various jurisdictions can have access to a firearm while under supervision, ranging from age 10 in the Northern Territory to 12 in other states.
Another situation is where a particular type of gun is banned in one state but legal elsewhere.
In the days after the Port Arthur massacre, then-Australian prime minister John Howard galvanised every state and territory to overhaul the country's gun laws.
More than 650,000 firearms were voluntarily handed in to authorities and destroyed, as part of a buyback programme. And background checks and a mandatory cooling-off period for gun sales were introduced. Automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were banned.
Similar gun reforms - a ban on semi-automatic weapons and a buyback scheme - were introduced in New Zealand after a white supremacist killed 51 Muslims at two Christchurch mosques in 2019.
Part of Howard's reforms included scrapping self-defence as a reason for owning a firearm - a contrast to gun laws in the United States where personal protection is often the main reason for citizens to own guns.
Gun ownership in the US is much higher compared to Australia as is gun violence. The country saw 488 mass shootings - defined as where four or more people are killed or injured - last year.
Recent polling by the Australia Institute showed that seven out of ten Australians think gun laws should make it harder to access a gun and 64% agreed that current gun laws need to be strengthened.
In the hours after the Bondi shooting, the NSW Premier Chris Minns was unequivocal about the need to tighten the state's gun laws.
""If you're not a farmer, you're not involved in agriculture, why do you need these massive weapons?"" he asked.
And less than 24 hours after the shooting, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hosted an emergency meeting where leaders from across the country pledged to tighten gun laws. On Friday he announced a national gun buyback scheme ""to help get guns off our streets"", the first scheme of its size since 1996.
Other proposals include:
limiting the number of guns someone can legally own
limiting ""open-ended"" licensing
making Australian citizenship a condition of owning a firearm
improving intelligence sharing when licence applications are being assessed
Albanese said there should also be regular reviews of licence holders.
""People's circumstances can change,"" he said. ""People can be radicalised over a period of time.""
The swift action prompted Howard – the architect of the 1996 gun laws – to weigh in.
While he supported stricter gun laws, Howard said the move was an ""attempted diversion"" from the real cause of the tragedy, which he said was a rise in antisemitism in recent years.
Mr Kenyon believes the moves to tighten gun laws are a waste of resources.
""All that time and effort and political capital could be spent combating radicalisation of individuals,"" he says.
The only thing that might have prevented Sunday's attack was better intelligence-sharing that would have flagged the gunmen's links to extremist ideology to the NSW firearms' registry, he says.
Elsewhere, one of the headline reforms proposed in 1996 - a national firearms register - is yet to be created, with authorities saying the database is ""expected to be operational by mid-2028"".
Little had been done to implement the measure until the 2022 fatal shooting of two police officers and a civilian in Wieambilla became a catalyst to speed the process up.
The Bondi shooting has now propelled the government to list the creation of the register as a priority.
Mr Browne believes the application process for a gun licence is too easy and that licences for recreational hunting should be abolished as its definition is ambiguous.
Sajid Akram owned a recreational hunting licence.
But recreational hunting contributes a ""valuable social good"" to Australia, argues Mr Kenyon, saying that hunters remove millions of feral animals such as rabbits, foxes and cats.
He was just 10 when he picked up his first gun. Now 53, he goes on regular hunting trips - often shooting deer in Victoria's high country - and competes in pistol shooting events six times a year.
Hunting isn't just a pastime for him, it's about family and community connections. He taught his three children - all adults now - how to shoot when they were teens.
""All my life I've had the opportunity to do it and I've enjoyed it,"" Mr Kenyon, a former Labour politician in South Australia, says, ""so I want my kids to have the same opportunity"".
In the wake of the Port Arthur massacre, self-loading firearms were banned, resulting in a drop in gun-related deaths, but the risk to public safety has now shifted to high-powered fast-loading rifles with magazines that can shoot up to five rounds, of the kind believed to have been used by the gunmen.
""If you watch the video, you'll see him firing rapidly with his rifle,"" Mr Browne says, referring to footage of one of the gunmen shooting from a footbridge leading to Bondi Beach.
""If he didn't have a magazine in that rifle, he would have had to manually reload each time,"" which would dramatically reduce - but not eliminate - the threat of a mass shooting.
Mass shootings remain rare in Australia.
In 2018, a Western Australian grandfather killed his wife, his daughter and four grandchildren before turning the gun on himself in what was, at the time, the worst such incident since Port Arthur.
For Mr Browne, Australia is a safe country but incidents involving firearms are not uncommon, ranging from neighbourhood disputes to gang shootings.
""This is a reflection on guns being in the wrong hands, a legacy of poor storage allowing guns to be stolen and sold - and thus move into black markets.""
But the issue of gun control isn't just about the physical firearm.
""It's like a plane crash, it's never just one thing. It's a culmination of a lot of factors,"" he says. Australia needs better assessment of whether a licence holder is a suitable candidate and more stringent rules on the types of guns that can be legally owned, he says.
In the aftermath of the Port Arthur massacre, Mr Browne met with many of the survivors and families of the victims including Walter Mikac, whose wife Nanette and two young daughters were among the 35 people killed.
Mr Mikac, who founded the Alannah and Madeline Foundation charity to honour his children, said the Bondi shooting was a ""horrific reminder"" of ensuring Australia's gun laws protect everyone.
""After Port Arthur, Australia made a collective commitment to put community safety first, and that commitment remains as important today as ever,"" he said in a statement.
Mr Browne echoed those sentiments.
Gun laws need to be reformed to ""keep up-to-date with changing community attitudes, technological advances and to rectify identified deficiencies,"" Mr Browne says.
""It's sad that it takes such a tragedy to get people to wake up and listen.""

Sydney
","When bullets began flying at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday, strangers Wayne and Jessica found themselves in the same nightmare scenario. They couldn't find their three-year-olds.
In the chaos, separately, they desperately scanned the green. People who'd gathered to celebrate the first day of Hanukkah screamed and ducked. Others ran. Some didn't make it far.
The 10-odd minutes that followed were the longest of their lives.
Wayne's body was acting as a human shield for his eldest daughter, but his mind was elsewhere: with his missing child Gigi.
""We had to wait all that time for the gunshots to stop. It felt like eternity,"" he tells the BBC.
Unbeknown to him, Jessica's gaze had caught on a little girl in a rainbow skirt, confused, scared and alone - calling out for her mummy and daddy.
The pregnant mother couldn't protect her own child, so in that moment she decided she'd protect this one. She smothered Gigi's body with her own, and uttered ""I've got you"", over and over again. They could feel the moment a woman about a metre away was shot and killed.
By the time the air finally fell silent, Wayne had become all but convinced Gigi was dead.
""I was looking amongst the blood and the bodies,"" he says, growing emotional.
""What I saw - no human should ever see that.""
Eventually, he caught a glimpse of a familiar colourful skirt and found his daughter, stained in red - but okay, still shrouded under Jessica. Her son too would soon be found, unharmed.
""She said she's just a mother and she acted with mother instincts,"" Wayne says.
""[But] she's a superhero. We'll be indebted to her for the rest of our lives.""
It is one of the incredible accounts of selflessness and courage that have emerged from one of Australia's darkest days.
Declared a terror attack by police, it is the deadliest in Australian history. Dozens were injured and 15 people - including a 10-year-old girl - were killed by the two gunmen, who police say were inspired by the jihadist group Islamic State (IS).
More people undoubtedly would have been harmed if it weren't for Ahmed al Ahmed.
A Syrian-Australian shop owner, he'd been having coffee nearby when the shooting began. His father told BBC Arabic Ahmed ""saw the victims, the blood, women and children lying on the street, and then acted"".
Footage of the moment he sprung out from behind a car and wrestled a gun off one of the attackers immediately went viral. He was shot multiple times, and may lose his arm.
Another man, Reuven Morrison, was also seen on the video hurling objects at the same attacker in the moments after Ahmed disarmed him.
Sheina Gutnik easily recognised her dad in the footage.
""He is not one to lie down. He is one to run towards danger,"" Ms Gutnick told BBC partner CBS News.
He had jumped up the second the shooting started, she said, and was throwing bricks at one of the gunmen before he was fatally shot.
""He went down fighting, protecting the people he loved most.""
The first two victims of the assault, Boris and Sofia Gurman, were also captured on dashcam footage grappling with one of the men for his weapon. When they succeeded, he got another gun from the car he'd just climbed out of and killed them.
""Even in the final moments of their lives, they showed the depth of who they were by facing those moments with courage, selflessness and love,"" read a message from their proud son Alex, which was read out at the couple's funeral on Friday.
""In doing so, they reminded us that they were not only devoted parents, but, in every sense of the word, heroes.""
The list goes on.
Chaya, only 14 years old, was shot in the leg while shielding two young children from gunfire.
Jack Hibbert - a beat cop just four months into the job - was hit in both the head and the shoulder but continued to help festival attendees until he physically couldn't, his family said. The 22-year-old will survive, but with life-changing injuries.
Lifeguard Jackson Doolan was photographed sprinting over from a neighbouring beach during the attack, armed with critical medical supplies. He didn't even pause to put on shoes.
Others at Bondi rushed from the beach into the fire, their red-and-yellow lifesaving boards working overtime as stretchers. One lifeguard even dived back into the surf to save swimmers who'd been sent into a panic by the shooting.
Student Levi Xu, 31, told the BBC he felt he could not shout for help, as he didn't want to draw attention to himself or risk any potential saviours being targeted.
But lifeguard Rory Davey saw him and his friend struggling, and dragged them back to shore.
""We stood up and wanted to thank him, but he had already gone back into the sea to rescue other people,"" says Mr Xu.
Thousands of Australians flocked to donate blood, dwarfing the previous record.
Authorities say many off-duty first responders travelled to Bondi on Sunday - from as far as two hours away - simply because they knew there was a need. Likewise, healthcare workers rushed to hospitals when they heard of the attack, shift or no shift, confronting unspeakable trauma to save lives.
""[They were] just coming into the station and saying 'I'm ready to go'. Coming to the scene and saying 'I'm ready... put me in',"" New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park told the BBC.
""Normally on a Sunday night, there is staff available to run one operating theatre [at St Vincent's Hospital]. There were eight operating at once,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.
State premier Chris Minns, too, has been quick to praise the heroics of ordinary, everyday Australians.
""This is a terrible, wanton act of destructive violence. But there are still amazing people that we have in Australia, and they showed their true colours last night,"" he said, the day after the attack.
Wayne says he shudders to think what would have happened without people like Jessica and Ahmed.
When he speaks to the BBC, he's just attended a funeral for the gunmen's youngest victim, 10-year-old Matilda.
""I was sitting at this funeral and I was just thinking, tears pouring out of my eyes... I could have been in the front... It could have been my little girl.""
""There could have been so much more devastation without the bravery of [these] people... someone who could run just comes in. Someone who could worry about their own child looks after another child.
""That's what the world needs more of.""

Australia announces gun buyback scheme in wake of Bondi attack,2025-12-19T02:30:21.301Z," Tiffanie Turnbull
Sydney
","The Australian government has announced a gun buyback scheme in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack - its deadliest mass shooting in decades.
The scheme is the largest since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, which left 35 people dead and prompted Australia to introduce world-leading gun control measures.
Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured on Sunday when two gunmen, believed to have been motivated by ""Islamic State ideology"", opened fire on a Jewish festival at the country's most iconic beach.
On Friday, police also said there was no ongoing reason to detain a group of men who were arrested in Sydney over their ""extremist Islamic ideology"".
Police allege Sunday's attack, which they have declared a terrorist incident, was committed by a father-son duo. Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.
The day after the shooting, national cabinet - which includes representatives from the federal government and leaders from all states and territories - agreed to tighten gun controls.
Speaking to media on Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there are now more than 4 million firearms in Australia - more than at the time of the Port Arthur massacre.
""We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney's suburbs... There's no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns.
""If you're going to reduce the number of guns, then a buyback scheme has to be a piece of that puzzle,"" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett added.
The new scheme will purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms, and will be funded on a 50-50 basis with the states and territories. Hundreds of thousands of firearms will be collected and destroyed, the government estimates.
National cabinet has also agreed to impose limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual, restrict open-ended firearms licensing and the types of guns that are legal and make Australian citizenship a condition of holding a firearm licence.
Work on a national firearms register will be accelerated and firearm regulators will have better access to criminal intelligence.
On Friday, New South Wales Police said they were preparing to release seven men with extremist ideology, but that they would continue to be monitored.
Tactical officers swarmed on the group, who had travelled from Victoria and were known to police there, in dramatic scenes in the suburb of Liverpool on Thursday. Officers found a knife, but no guns or other weapons.
NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference there is ""no confirmed link"" between the alleged terrorists and the detained group, but that Bondi Beach was one of several locations the latter was intending to visit.
""Whilst this specific threat posed by the males is unknown, I can say that the potential [for] a violent offence being committed was such that we were not prepared to tolerate the risk,"" Commissioner Lanyon said.

Australian PM announces crackdown on hate speech after Bondi shooting,2025-12-18T23:54:36.983Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his government will crack down on hate speech following Sunday's deadly shooting at Bondi Beach that targeted a Jewish festival.
Fifteen people were killed when two gunmen opened fire at an event to mark the first day of Hanukkah.
New laws will target ""those who spread hate, division and radicalisation"", Albanese told reporters in Canberra.
The home affairs minister will also be given new powers to cancel or refuse visas for those who spread hate and a new taskforce will be set up to ensure the education system ""prevents, tackles and properly responds to antisemitism"".
The new laws will also include penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence, a new federal offence of ""aggravated hate speech"", and the introduction of ""hate"" as an aggravating factor in sentencing crimes for online threats and harassment.
""Every Jewish Australian has the right to feel safe, valued and respected for the contribution that they make to our great nation,"" Albanese said.
""The terrorists, inspired by ISIS... sought to turn Australians against each other. Australians have responded to that act of hatred with love and sympathy for those in mourning.""
Daniel Aghion, the President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the peak body representing Australian Jews, said he would ""need to see the details before making an assessment as to whether the measures are likely to live up to their billing.""
""We warned of the risk of not dealing with antisemitism in this country promptly and effectively after 7 October. It is an absolute tragedy that it has taken a massacre of Jewish and other Australians for that step to be taken.""
David Ossip, president of NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, welcomed the changes. ""For too long, Australian Jews have been targeted through social media, hate preachers and university campus activities. It was conveniently ignored until it was too late. The gaslighting and dismissal must end,"" he was quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald as saying.
Tensions have been high in the country since the shooting, with police detaining seven men in southwest Sydney on Thursday after receiving a tip that a ""violent act was possibly being planned"", New South Wales Police said in a statement.
Police said they did not identify ""any connection"" to their investigation into Sunday's attack in Bondi.
Two cars were ""intercepted"" at George Street, police said. In videos shared by local media sites, armed officers appeared to detain people on the street just hours after Albanese made his speech.
Antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal, who also spoke at the press conference, said the country was ""at a very important moment not only for our community, but for fighting antisemitism around the world.""
Albanese said his government would be ""fully supporting and adopting"" the recommendations Segal put forward in July in a report.
Her report was criticised by some upon its release in July due to its implications for free speech, including plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. There were concerns for instance, that the funding could be used to silence pro-Palestinian protests.
The Jewish Council of Australia said it supported Albanese's commitment to act, including his focus on gun reform and online hate.
But, it said it was ""concerned that elements of today's announcement resemble long-standing proposals from the pro-Israel lobby which have nothing to do with addressing violent extremism.""
""If education initiatives like university scorecards become a form of ideological policing - particularly where they are used to limit legitimate criticism of Israel - they will only make Jews less safe, and do the opposite of combating antisemitism,"" Jewish Council of Australia executive officer Dr Max Kaiser said.
Meanwhile, Albanese acknowledged accusations from the Jewish community that his government had not done enough to prevent antisemitism since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, and said more could have been done.
""I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia,"" he said. ""But what I also do is accept my responsibility to lead the nation and unite the nation. Because what people are looking for at this time isn't more division.""
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government was ""shifting the threshold"" on hate speech.
""There have been individuals who have managed to exploit a nation that had different principles of freedom of speech and have gone right to the limits of language that is clearly dehumanising, unacceptable, having no place in Australia, but have not quite crossed the threshold to violence,"" he said.

"Don't let Matilda's death fuel anger, say family of Bondi victim, 10, at funeral",2025-12-18T08:29:56.443Z," Tiffanie TurnbullandKaty Watson
Sydney
","The family of the Bondi shooting's youngest victim, Matilda, urged the community not to let her death fuel anger, as they said a final goodbye to the 10-year-old on Thursday.
Matilda was among 15 people who were shot dead when two gunmen opened fire on an event marking the start of Hanukkah at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday.
Speaking to the BBC at Matilda's funeral, her aunt Lina Chernykh said the Jewish community is right to want more action to stamp out antisemitism – she does too.
But she said Matilda was a joyous child who spread love everywhere she went, and urged the community to do the same in her honour.
""Take your anger and… just spread happiness and love and memory for my lovely niece,"" Ms Chernykh said.
""I hope maybe she's an angel now. Maybe she [will] send some good vibes to the world.""
Jewish community leaders have in recent days suggested the tragedy was an inevitable result of Australia struggling to address rising antisemitism.
The attack on Sunday was the country's deadliest incident since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people during the Port Arthur massacre.
Mourners - including the Governor General Sam Mostyn and New South Wales Premier Chris Minns - packed out the service in Sydney, wearing bee brooches and stickers in honour of the girl who adored them.
Michael and Valentyna had named their daughter after the song Waltzing Matilda, as a tribute to the country where their Ukrainian family found safety.
""She's waltzing with the angels,"" Minns said, reading a poem written for her.
Rabbi Yehoram Ulman, who led the service, had to pause and collect himself as he paid tribute to Matilda's short life.
""The tragic, so totally cruel, unfathomable murder of young Matilda is something to all of us as if our own daughter was taken from us,"" he said.
The service heard how she had lived with beauty, goodness and righteousness.
""The Jewish ... believe that death is not eternal … it is not because we are naïve,"" Rabbi Ulman said.
""I'm telling you with absolute conviction that the separation with Matilda is not forever.""
Still, he conceded that his words would likely offer little comfort - something he knows too well. A day earlier, Rabbi Ulman spoke at the funeral of his own son-in-law, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, who was also killed in the attack on Bondi.
""You give me strength at a time when you need strength yourselves. And I try to do the same,"" he said to Matilda's parents, who sobbed in the front row.
Ms Chernykh earlier said the family was devastated.
""I look at their faces [and] I don't know if they will be ever happy again,"" she said of Matilda's parents.
Matilda's younger sister, from whom she was ""inseparable"", is shattered and confused, she said. ""She doesn't have enough tears to cry.""
On the same day the shooting's youngest victim was laid to rest, its eldest was too. A service for Alexander Kleytman - an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor - was held at the same funeral home on Thursday morning.
In a statement, his family said he died doing what he loved most: protecting his wife Larisa and celebrating his Jewish faith.
""The two gunmen killed him, but his memories, his legacy, and his books will bring light for generations to come,"" it read.
Their local Chabad mission later said Alexander had died ""shielding"" his wife from the gunmen's bullets.
JewishCare, a local organisation, had praised the couple's ""resilience, strength, and adaptability"" which ""serve as a testament to the enduring nature of the human spirit"" in its 2023 annual report.
Both Larisa and Alexander had faced ""the unspeakable terror of the Holocaust"", the organisation said, adding that the couple immigrated to Australia from Ukraine.
""Alex's memories are particularly harrowing; recalling the dreadful conditions in Siberia where he, along with his mother and younger brother, struggled for survival.
""The scars of the past, however, did not deter them from seeking a brighter future.""
In addition to his wife, he leaves behind two children and 11 grandchildren, Chabad confirmed in a statement.
A funeral was also held on Thursday for another victim, 78-year-old Tibor Weitzen, who was described as a family man ""above all else"".
His daughter Hanna Abesidon spoke at his funeral and said his love for his family was ""constant, unconditional and deeply felt"", ABC News reported.
""I'm so sorry I couldn't save you. I'm so sorry,"" she said.
Police have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been ""motivated by Islamic State"" group ideology.
Police allege that the two gunmen were a father and son. Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead at the scene, while his son Naveed, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act.
Two people out of the 16 injured who remain in hospitals are still in critical condition, local authorities said.
Australia on Thursday announced it would strengthen laws to crack down on hate - including by introducing powers to cancel or refuse visas on grounds of antisemitism.

","Naveed Akram, the surviving suspect in Sunday's mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act, the New South Wales police say.
Akram, 24, was critically injured during the incident. His father Sajid Akram, 50, was killed in an exchange of fire with police at the scene.
Fifteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured in the attack, which targeted Australia's Jewish community at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.
It was the country's deadliest shooting since 1996.
Among the charges against Akram are 40 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, as well as one charge of causing a public display of a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol.
Akram had his first hearing from his hospital bedside, the local New South Wales court said.
The case has been adjourned until April 2026, the court added.
Earlier on Wednesday, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said they were waiting for medication to wear off before formally questioning Akram.
""For his fairness, we need him to understand what is exactly happening,"" Lanyon said.
As of Wednesday evening local time, 17 people are still being treated in hospitals across Sydney. One is in critical condition, with four others described as critical but stable.
Police have designated the attack a terrorist incident, with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying it appears to have been ""motivated by Islamic State"" group ideology.
On Tuesday, it emerged that the father and son had travelled to the Philippines in November.
The Philippine immigration bureau told the BBC that they were in the country from 1 November to 28 November. Their final destination was the southern city of Davao, an immigration spokesperson said.
Naveed Akram travelled to the Philippines using an Australian passport, while his father Sajid used an Indian passport, border authorities in Manila told the BBC.
Sajid Akram was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, but had ""limited contact"" with his family there, a police official from the Indian state of Telangana said.
Among those killed in the attack were two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor and a 10-year-old girl, named by her family as Matilda.
Boris and Sofia Gurman, a couple filmed wrestling with one of the gunmen during the early stages of the attack, were also among the victims.
Another 27 people were taken to hospital with injuries, including two police officers.
One of the officers, named as 22-year-old Jack Hibbert, has lost vision in one eye and faces a ""long and challenging recovery"", his family said in a statement.
Earlier in the day, thousands gathered to mourn British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, at the first funeral to be held for victims of the shooting.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was not present. Asked on ABC NewsRadio about his absence, he said: ""I would attend anything that I'm invited to. These are funerals that are taking place to farewell people's loved ones.""
The Jewish community has criticised Albanese for not taking enough action on antisemitism - he defended himself against those accusations, telling ABC NewsRadio he had taken a series of measures including appointing the country's first antisemitism envoy, toughening hate speech laws and increasing funding for social cohesion projects and Jewish institutions.
Speaking at Rabbi Schlanger's funeral, Rabbi Levi Wolff described his death as an ""unspeakable loss"" for the community.
""Eli was ripped away from us, doing what he loved best,"" he said.
""Spreading love and joy and caring for his people with endless self-sacrifice in his life and in his death, he towered above as one of the highest and holiest souls.""
Rabbi Schlanger had helped organise Sunday's Hanukkah event.
Funerals for the other victims are expected to happen over the coming days, including for the youngest victim, Matilda, on Thursday.

'An unspeakable loss': Funeral takes place for rabbi killed in Bondi shooting,2025-12-17T08:25:50.432Z," Helen LivingstoneandKaty Watson
Bondi Beach
","The first of the funerals for victims of the Bondi Beach shooting has taken place in Sydney, with thousands gathering to mourn Rabbi Eli Schlanger.
He was among 15 people killed when two gunmen opened fire on a festival marking the first day of Hanukkah. Australia's prime minister said that the attackers appear to have been inspired by Islamic State (IS) group.
Rabbi Schlanger, who was known as the ""Bondi Rabbi"" and had helped organise Sunday's event, was born in the UK. His wife gave birth to their fifth child just two months ago.
Hours later, the funeral of another Rabbi who was killed in the attack - Yaakov Levitan, a 39-year-old father of four - was held.
At the service for Schlanger, Rabbi Levi Wolff said his death was an ""unspeakable loss"" for the community, the Chabad of Bondi and ""the entire Jewish nation"".
""Eli was ripped away from us, doing what he loved best,"" he said.
""Spreading love and joy and caring for his people with endless self-sacrifice in his life and in his death, he towered above as one of the highest and holiest souls.""
He was mourned by his father-in-law as a person beloved by the community. The 41-year-old was ""my son, my friend, my confidant,"" Rabbi Yehoram Ulman told the congregation at the Chabad of Bondi.
""My biggest regret was, apart from the obvious, to tell Eli more often how much we love him, how much I love him, how much we appreciate everything that he does and how proud we are of him,"" Rabbi Ulman said.
""I hope he knew that but I think it should have been said more often.""
Ulman also urged Jewish people not to hide in the aftermath of the attack and said that on Sunday night - the final night of Hanukkah - they would continue a 31-year-old tradition, and light the final candle on Bondi Beach.
""All the rabbis together, under the banner of our Chabat house of Bondi, to which Eli dedicated his life, we are going to gather in Bondi Beach,"" he said.
The funeral of 10-year-old Matilda, the youngest victim, is to take place on Thursday.
Speaking to reporters in Bondi on Wednesday, Matilda's father praised lifesavers, bystanders and police officers who came to their assistance as they struggled to save their daughter's life, and a woman who helped their younger daughter, Summer.
""I must say the biggest thank you to the lady that saved Summer,"" he said. ""I don't know who she was but she literally hugged her for the whole ten minutes of shooting.""
Opposition leader Sussan Ley, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns, former prime minister Scott Morrison and Israeli Ambassador Amir Maimon were among those attending Schlanger's funeral.
Anthony Albanese was not present. Asked on ABC NewsRadio about his absence, the prime minister said, ""I would attend anything that I'm invited to. These are funerals that are taking place to farewell people's loved ones.""
The Jewish community has criticised Albanese for not taking enough action on antisemitism.
The prime minister defended himself against those accusations on Wednesday, telling ABC NewsRadio he had taken a series of measures including appointing the country's first antisemitism envoy, toughening hate speech laws and increasing funding for social cohesion projects and Jewish institutions.
Naveed Akram has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act, according to the New South Wales Police.
Akram also faces 40 charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, as well as one charge of causing a public display of a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol.
His father, 50-year-old Sajid Akram, was shot dead.
The attack was the country's deadliest shooting since 1996.
Two police officers were critically injured in the shooting and police on Wednesday confirmed that one of them had lost the sight in one eye as a result.
Jack Hibbert, 22, had only been in the police force for four months when he was shot, police said in a statement. During the attack he had ""responded with courage, instinct, and selflessness, continuing to protect and help others whilst injured, until he was physically no longer able to.""
The second officer, constable Scott Dyson, underwent further surgery this morning and is in a critical but stable condition, Lanyon added.

'Best of our country': Australian PM visits Bondi hero in hospital,2025-12-16T11:43:27.074Z," Kerena Cobbina
","Australia's Prime Minister has visited Bondi hero Ahmed al Ahmed in hospital, after the bystander tried to disarm one of the gunmen in the nation's deadliest gun attack since 1996.
""Your heart is strong"", PM Anthony Albanese told the father-of-two, later calling him ""the best of our country"".
The fruit shop owner, who was born and raised in Syria, was shot several times in the shoulder after tackling one of the alleged gunmen. Albanese said Mr Ahmed would ""undergo further surgery"" on Wednesday.
At least 15 people have been confirmed dead after Sunday's attack in Sydney during an event to mark the first night of Hanukkah.
Police have declared the attack as a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.
""He was trying to get a cup of coffee and found himself at a moment where people were being shot in front of him,"" Albanese said after the bedside visit.
""He decided to take action, and his bravery is an inspiration for all Australians. He is a very humble man.""
""At a moment where we have seen evil perpetrated, he shines out as an example of the strength of humanity,"" the prime minister added.
""We are a brave country. Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.""
He later added: ""Ahmed, you are an Australian hero.""
There has been nationwide support for the 43-year-old including from US President Donald Trump who commended his courage, and a US billionaire who donated $99,999 (US$ 65,000; £49,000) to Mr Ahmed, calling him a ""brave hero"".
In the footage, Mr Ahmed is seen hiding behind a parked car before he leaps out.
He runs at the alleged gunman and seizes his weapon, before turning the gun round on him. The suspected attacker then begins to retreat.
Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the attackers.
Mr Ahmed's father previously told the BBC that his son was driven to act by his ""sentiment, conscience and humanity"".
He ""saw the victims, the blood, women and children lying on the street, and then acted"".

Dashcam video shows couple trying to stop gunman before being killed in Bondi attack,2025-12-16T11:07:53.101Z," Francesca GillettandAnna Lamche
","A couple killed in the Bondi Beach shooting tried to stop one of the alleged attackers by grabbing his gun, dramatic dashcam footage shows.
Boris Gurman, 69, and his wife Sofia, 61, courageously stepped in to try and protect others before being shot themselves, their family said in a statement.
Video of the incident shows Mr Gurman, who was retired, wrestling with one of the gunmen and taking the weapon off him, before they both fall onto the road.
Mr Gurman then gets up and appears to hit the attacker with the gun. The attacker is then thought to have got another gun which he used to kill them.
""While nothing can lessen the pain of losing Boris and Sofia, we feel an overwhelming sense of pride in their bravery and selflessness,"" the couple's family said.
""This encapsulates who Boris and Sofia were - people who instinctively and selflessly tried to help others.""
The Gurman couple, who were Jewish, were the first two people killed in Sunday's attack, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.
At least 15 people have been confirmed dead in the shooting, which happened during an event to mark the first day of Hanukkah.
In their statement, the family said the couple had been married for 34 years.
""We are heartbroken by the sudden and senseless loss of our beloved Boris and Sofia Gurman.
""Boris was a retired mechanic, known for his generosity, quiet strength and willingness to lend a hand to anyone in need.
""Sofia worked at Australia Post and was deeply loved by her colleagues and community.
""Bondi locals, together they lived honest, hardworking lives and treated everyone they met with kindness, warmth and respect. Boris and Sofia were devoted to their family and to each other. They were the heart of our family, and their absence has left an immeasurable void.""
Witnesses have described Mr Gurman as a hero.
The woman who owns the dashcam footage told Reuters news agency that Mr Gurman ""did not run away - instead, he charged straight toward the danger, using all his strength trying to wrestle away the gun and fighting to the death"".
""I can see from my camera that the elderly man was ultimately shot and collapsed. That moment broke my heart,"" she said.
Another person who said they witnessed the incident told 9News: ""He was a hero. He tried, he tried. We need to let his family know.
""Everyone needs to know what he tried, because it was right in the beginning. And he put himself in that face of danger. There were bullets flying already, and he put his self in the face of danger.""
Police have described the attack as a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.
The other victims who were killed include a 10-year-old girl, a British-born rabbi, a retired police officer, and a Holocaust survivor.
The ages of the victims range from 10 to 87.
A further 22 people remain in hospital, nine of whom are in a critical condition.
Earlier this week, another bystander named Ahmed al Ahmed, 43, was also hailed a hero after he wrested a gun from one of the attackers. He was shot multiple times but survived, and has since undergone surgery for his wounds.
His father told BBC Arabic that his son was driven by his ""conscience"" and ""saw the victims, the blood, women and children lying on the street, and then acted"".
Police have alleged that the attack was carried out by Sajid Akram, 50, and his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram.
They appear to have been motivated by Islamic State (IS) ideology, authorities said, and police found ""homemade"" IS group flags and improvised explosive devices in the vehicle used by the suspects.
Sajid, who was found dead at the scene, was originally from the Indian city of Hyderabad, an Indian police official said.
The official told BBC Telugu that Sajid Akram had ""visited India on six occasions after migrating to Australia, primarily for family-related reasons such as property matters and visits to his elderly parents.
""It is understood that he did not travel to India even at the time of his father's demise,"" the official added. ""The factors that led to the radicalisation of Sajid Akram and his son, Naveed appear to have no connection with India or any local influence in Telangana.""
According to Australian media, Naveed Akram has woken from his coma and is conscious in hospital.
Police said the pair travelled to the Philippines on 1 November, and Australia's immigration bureau confirmed that they stayed for four weeks. Officers are now investigating why they made the trip.
Unconfirmed media reports say the suspects received ""military-style training"" while in South East Asia, however the Philippine military has said that as yet there is ""no validated confirmation"" of this.

Police 'shot in the front': NSW premier rejects criticism of Bondi response,2025-12-16T07:00:32.296Z," Helen Livingstone
Sydney
","The New South Wales premier has rejected criticism of the police response to the attack on a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach, saying officers acted with ""bravery and integrity"".
Some witnesses have suggested police were too slow to disarm the two gunmen, who killed 15 people and injured dozens in Australia's most famous beach on Sunday.
""There are two officers in critical care... at the moment,"" Chris Minns said after sustained questioning from reporters. ""They weren't shot in the back as they were running away. They were shot in the front.""
The gunmen went on a shooting spree that lasted around ten minutes before police shot both men, killing one and critically injuring the other.
There have also been questions about whether adequate security was provided before the shooting took place.
""They shoot, shoot, change magazine and just shoot,"" one witness, Shmulik Scuri, told reporters the day of the assault, adding he thought officers ""froze"".
Asked about these criticisms, Minns said the ""rush to conclusions"" about the police operation was ""disrespectful"".
""They didn't take a backward step. They engaged the gunmen on the footbridge with handguns. The offenders had long range rifles,"" Minns said.
""If there's any suggestion that NSW Police didn't live up to their responsibilities to the people of this state, it should be rejected because it's not consistent with the facts.""
NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon avoided questions about how many officers had been deployed to police the event in advance. He told reporters police ""regularly patrol that area as we did on that day"" and that police presence was based ""on the threat that exists at the time"".
Australia's security agency has said the younger alleged gunman in the father-son duo, Naveed Akram, had come to their attention in 2019 due to his associations, but that there was nothing to suggest he was a risk of violence.
""Had there been intelligence that there was a particular threat at that location, or to that event, we may have had a different policing response,"" Commissioner Lanyon said.
NSW Police established Operation Shelter after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel to investigate antisemitic hate crimes. As part of the operation, regular patrols are conducted of high-risk locations. The eastern suburbs of Sydney, including Bondi, which has a significant Jewish population, is a key focus.
Another taskforce, Strike Force Pearl, was set up later to investigate hate crimes in Sydney.
Dr Vincent Hurley, a former police officer who lectures on policing at Macquarie University, told the BBC it was ""unrealistic"" to expect police to be able to know how to react to every possible scenario.
""To respond to a mass shooting and mass killing event like that, there's no training that can be done.""
He pointed out that police officers would have initially been reliant on calls to emergency operators ""and everyone would have given them a different story"".
""Then they have to fight through traffic at Bondi Beach which is a nightmare at the best of times.""
At the scene, police would have been confronted with ""absolute chaos"" as thousands of people attempted to flee.
Individual officers would also have been faced with difficult choices such as whether to stop and render assistance to injured individuals or to go and look for the gunmen, decisions for which there is no protocol.
And even once the offenders had been identified, he says the risk of hurting bystanders in the crossfire would have complicated responses.
""There would be no way as a police officer, I would have drawn my firearm because all of the innocent individuals"", he added. ""It's not what you see on Netflix.""

What we know about the Bondi Beach Hanukkah shooting,2025-12-16T05:48:44.823Z," Tom McArthur
Emily AtkinsonandMalu Cursino
","Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has vowed to strengthen gun laws after a shooting targeting the country's Jewish community at a Hanukkah event on Sydney's Bondi Beach.
Fifteen people including a 10-year-old girl were killed in the attack, which Albanese described as an ""act of antisemitism... [and] terrorism"".
Police are alleging that the two gunmen were a father and son; Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police, while his son Naveed, 24, is in hospital. His condition is unknown.
The prime minister said that the evidence points towards the attack being inspired by Islamic State (IS), after two flags were found in a car that belonged to the alleged perpetrators.
Mass shootings in Australia are very rare. This attack is the country's deadliest incident since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people during the Port Arthur massacre.
Police have declared the shooting a terrorist attack.
Here is what we know so far.
On Sunday 14 December, at 18:47 (07:47 GMT), police received reports of gunfire at a park in Bondi Beach.
Verified videos captured people fleeing the beach, screaming and running as a gunshots rang out.
Some footage appears to show two gunmen firing from a small bridge near a car park on Campbell Parade, on the northern end of Bondi Beach. They are firing down towards an area of parkland where the Hanukkah event is taking place.
Separate video from a few minutes later shows a bystander - since identified as Ahmed al Ahmed - disarming one of the gunmen. Mr al Ahmed, a fruit shop owner and father-of-two, tackles the gunman, seizes his gun and turns it back on him.
The gunman then retreats towards the bridge, from where another attacker is firing.
In the same footage, another man - who appears to be injured - is seen fleeing the scene, as police arrive and begin to fire in the direction of the gunmen.
Another verified video shows several police officers on the same bridge. One appears to be administering CPR to a motionless man as someone shouts: ""He's dead, he's dead.""
At 18:57, New South Wales (NSW) Police share their first public statement, urging people at the scene to take shelter and others to avoid the area.
At 19:39, police say two people are in custody while at 22:00, NSW Police designate the incident as a terrorist attack on Sydney's Jewish community.
A 10-year-old girl was among 15 people killed in the attack, according to NSW Police. Two rabbis and a Holocaust survivor were also killed.
The ages of the victims range from 10 to 87.
The family of British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, told the BBC he was among the dead. He had helped organise the Hanukkah event, Jewish organisation Chabad said.
Rabbi Schlanger's cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis, described him as ""vivacious, energetic, full of life and a very warm outgoing person who loved to help people"".
Also among those killed was Rabbi Yaakov Levitan, described as a ""popular co-ordinator"" of Chabad activities in Sydney.
Alexander Kleytman, a Holocaust survivor, was killed while trying to shield his wife, Chabad says.
Israeli media report that an Israeli citizen was also killed, and French citizen Dan Elkayam has also been identified as a victim of the attack.
A further 42 people were taken to hospital due to their injuries. Australian health authorities say 24 people are being treated in hospitals across Sydney, and three of them are in a critical condition.
NSW Health Minister Ryan Park told ABC News on Monday that four children had been transferred to Sydney Children's Hospital.
Two police officers were shot and injured during the incident, according to police.
Both officers remain in hospital in a serious but stable condition; police have named one of those officers as Constable Scott Dyson, who had been attached to Eastern Suburbs Police Area Command for 18 months. The second officer has not been identified.
Police have alleged that the attack was carried out by two gunmen: Sajid Akram, 50, and his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram.
Sajid was a licensed firearms holder, having met the eligibility criteria for a recreational hunting licence.
He was linked to six firearms, all of which were believed to have been used in the attack, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said.
The father arrived in Australia in 1998 on a student visa, Home Minister Tony Burke said. The visa was transferred in 2001 to a partner visa and later resident return visas.
Naveed Akram is an Australian-born citizen. Albanese said he had first come to the attention of authorities in October 2019.
He had been ""examined on the basis of being associated with others"", Albanese said, ""and the assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence"".
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported that the 24-year-old was examined over his close ties to a Sydney-based IS cell.
NSW Police say that the father and son also travelled to the Philippines in the month prior to the shooting, and that investigation is ongoing as to the purpose of that trip.
Sajid and Naveed arrived in the Philippines on 1 November and left on 28 November, the country's immigration bureau has confirmed to the BBC.
It says that Sajid travelled using an Indian passport, while his son used Australian identification.
Citing security sources, the ABC has said that the pair travelled to the island nation to receive ""military-style training"", but officials have not been able to confirm those reports.
Albanese has said that he will put tougher new gun laws on the agenda for a national cabinet meeting.
These will include proposals to limit the number of guns that can be used or licensed by individuals, and introducing regular reviews of licences.
Australia has some of the world's most stringent gun laws. Permits and licenses are required to own guns while all people who own firearms also have to be registered.
In other reaction:
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a phone call with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong to ""discuss the antisemitic terrorist attack""
Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the shooting a ""very cruel attack on Jews""
King Charles III - who is head of state in the Commonwealth nation - said he was ""appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack""
NSW Premier Chris Minns asked people to continue laying flowers at a memorial site at the rear of the Bondi pavilion. He also welcomed the ""record numbers"" of people and massive lines at blood donation services across the state.
Hanukkah, or Chanukah in Hebrew, is often referred to as the Jewish festival of lights.
It reminds Jewish people of when they won a battle against Greeks to practise their religion freely, more than 2,000 years ago.
The date changes but it always falls in November or December.
An event to mark the first day of the celebration was taking place on Bondi Beach at the time of the shooting.
A digital flyer for the event, named Chanuka by the Sea 2025, shows it was scheduled to take place near the beach's children's playground from 17:00.
Organised by Chabad, the event was set to feature live entertainment and activities ""for all ages"". Around 1,000 people were said to be in attendance.

Bondi Beach
Sydney
","Sunday dawned hot and clear at Bondi - not a cloud in the sky, the sun shining as the waves crashed onto the sand.
It was a day made for the beach. By midday, the entire stretch was heaving with thousands of people and the sea was full of swimmers and surfers. Our family of four, on holiday at Bondi Beach, was among them.
As we headed to the beach, crossing on a footbridge from the carpark of Campbell Parade, I noticed people were setting up white tents on the grass next to a children's playground.
A truck arrived, carrying a climbing wall. Later we would learn they were preparing for a Jewish community event, called Chanukah by the Sea, to celebrate the start of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.
In the late afternoon, loud upbeat music boomed from the speakers and across the beach. The event had begun. Our family packed up our things at the beach at about 18:00 local time (07:00 GMT) to go back to the holiday home we had rented nearby.
As we crossed the footbridge again, we saw hundreds of people - families with young children and grandparents - at the event. A stage had been set up for live performances with rows of chairs set out in front. Activity stations and stalls lined the green. The mood was relaxed and festive as laughter and children's cries floated in the air.
Scores more people were streaming into the event via an entry point with what looked like bag checks. Metal barriers had been set up to fence the event off from the rest of the green, but there appeared to be minimal security.
As the event looked like it could have food stalls, I suggested to my husband we check it out for dinner. ""Let's just get pizza back at the house,"" he sighed - the kids were getting cranky and needed a shower.
So I went back with the children, while my husband stopped by a pizzeria for a takeaway.
Half an hour later, he returned home with the pizzas, and a worried look. While he was buying dinner, people had run past him in a panic. One of them stopped to say, ""Mate, get away from here, something bad's happened.""
We could hear police sirens and the roar of helicopters. We checked the news, and I quickly went to the scene, which was just 100m from where we were staying.
Police officers were just starting to cordon off the car park in front of the footbridge where my family and I had crossed over - and which the attackers used, not even an hour later, as a vantage point to shoot at the festival we had seen earlier.
Many people had gathered at a corner close to the cordon where there were bars and restaurants. Lively music blared during a beautiful sunset - an incongruous setting for what had become a deadly evening at the beach.
People were anxiously milling about, some crying and in shock. A few were desperately trying to get in touch with their loved ones who were stuck in the area that was being cordoned off.
""My daughter's at the surf club just over there, and I can't contact her,"" one woman told me, her eyes filling with tears. Some were arguing with police at the cordon, insisting they needed to find their relatives or get to their cars or homes.
I caught a man running past - he told me his name was Barry. He had just fled the festival with his two children. When he heard gunshots, they dropped to the ground, he said.
""And as we're lying there on the floor, with my kids, I saw a shooter or two on the bridge on the side towards Bondi beach, shooting at all of us,"" he said. ""It was pandemonium and chaos.""
Soon the restaurants and bars on the corner shut down, even as the crowd of onlookers and media grew.
As the night wore on, police and emergency vehicles moved in and out of the zone, clearing what we learnt later was a car filled with IEDs.
A fierce wind whipped up from the beach, as officers tried to hold the cordon.
The next morning, the main stretch of Bondi was deserted. Uncertainty, shock and anxiety still lingered. At the police cordon, a crowd thronged a cafe, buying coffees while worriedly discussing what had happened the previous night.
Watching the scene were Bondi residents Ali Pattillo, Abby Agwunobi and Brooke Schlesinger. The three women, all Americans, live in an apartment overlooking the shooting site. When they heard the gunshots, they thought it was fireworks.
""I started hearing people kind of screaming and running, grabbed the dog and hid in the bathroom,"" Ms Pattillo said. ""And then you could just sort of hear the entire thing play out in this like horrible dream.""
Ms Schlesinger said the attack was such a shock because ""what appealed to us most about the Australian lifestyle is that sense of security and safety and community"".
Although the Bondi community was ""incredibly tight"", Ms Agwunobi said she was worried about ""the backlash and fallout that might happen from this"", particularly with ""the kind of climate with people being very anti-immigration.""
""So, yeah, I'm very afraid for the next few days. And my heart just goes to the Jewish community as well because... it's just such a violation to happen, especially on a holy celebration"".
Across the street, some people began laying out bouquets of flowers, balloons and an Australian flag at the corner of a primary school, in an impromptu memorial for the dead.
Soon, more people arrived to grieve at the spot. Some draped Israeli flags around their shoulders and wore kippahs, or Jewish skullcaps. People wept openly and embraced one another.
Others expressed fear and despair, including Jewish people who said they had been feeling vulnerable after a spate of antisemitism-related offences. Yvonne Haber, a Bondi resident who is Jewish, said an attack like this has ""been waiting to happen, and we've been saying this is gonna happen. And now that it's happened... it's absolutely horrific.""
As the sun began to set, I went to Bondi Pavilion, which had become a shrine for mourners after police removed part of the cordon.
Israeli and Australian flags hung on the closed gates of the pavilion, as hundreds of people gathered to lay wreaths, bouquets, candles and pebbles from the beach. The enormous pile of flowers framed a handwritten sign: ""We stay united, no more hate, just love.""
As 18:47 neared - the time of the attack the day before - a group of local Jewish leaders stepped forward with a large menorah with candles. They announced they were going to light the candles - a ritual associated with Hanukkah - to remember those killed in the attack, and urged the crowd to light their own candles from the menorah and take it home with them.
""We invite the crowd to take the light, to spread peace and tolerance. We have survived for thousands of years... light will always prevail,"" Rabbi Yossi Shuchat announced to the crowd.
Then the group began singing traditional Jewish songs, with many in the crowd joining in. Their voices soared, cracked with grief, enveloping those gathered in a wave of pure emotion.
A woman behind me quietly sobbed as she sang and clapped along to the more spirited songs. At one point, the crowd broke out into the Australian national anthem.
Afterwards, Rabbi Shuchat told me that he and his friends had decided that morning to hold the ceremony for the victims - and to make a powerful statement.
""Darkness has no power where light arrives, and therefore we implore everyone to be that light in their surroundings. Don't allow evil to come. The best way to banish evil is to shine a light.""

UK chief rabbi says cousin hid for 15 'terrifying' minutes in Bondi attack,2025-12-15T21:35:25.567Z," Gabriela PomeroyandLucy Manning
special correspondent
","The UK's chief rabbi has said his cousin and cousin's wife ""spent 15 terrifying minutes hiding under a doughnut stand"" as gunmen opened fire during an attack on a Hanukkah event in Bondi Beach.
""People to their right and left were being shot dead,"" Sir Ephraim Mirvis said.
Fifteen people including a 10-year-old girl were killed by two gunmen targeting the Jewish celebration on the beach in Sydney, Australia on Sunday.
Rabbi Mirvis said nothing would stop Jews in the UK and around the world celebrating their faith in public, while Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer vowed to protect British Jews following the attack, which he said was not an ""isolated incident"".
The chief rabbi, who represents the largest Jewish community in the UK, also said the causes of ""toxic antisemitism"" must be addressed, calling for authorities to crack down on hate speech.
Around 1,000 people were said to be attending the Bondi Beach Hanukkah celebration on Sunday evening when the shooting began, with verified videos showing attendees screaming and running as a volley of gunshots rang out.
The ages of the victims range from 10 to 87 years old. Among the dead are two rabbis and a Holocaust survivor.
The two gunmen have been named in local media as 50-year-old Sajid Akram, who died at the scene, and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, who is in hospital in a critical condition. The two had reportedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.
Rabbi Mirvis, who will travel to Sydney on Tuesday, said Jewish people had been ""targeted for the simple act of gathering together, visibly and peacefully, as Jews"".
The right of Jewish communities to gather safely and publicly was a ""test of the moral health of any society"", he said.
""Jews have lived with security concerns for as long as I can remember, but the fact that today every public Jewish gathering must be weighed for risk is a sign of something deeply wrong.""
A society in which a minority group have to ""calculate whether it is safe to be seen together in public"" is a society that is ""failing all of its citizens"".
Sir Keir, who spoke to Rabbi Mirvis on Sunday night, has pledged a ""more visible security presence"" at Hanukkah events following the attack.
""It has impacted on Jewish communities here in the UK, that I know feel even more insecure today than they did before,"" he told a Commons committee on Monday.
""This is clearly not an isolated incident, and these incidents are chillingly focused on some of the holiest days of the Jewish calendar,"" the PM said, referencing an attack on Heaton Park Synagogue on Yom Kippur that left two Jewish victims dead.
Sir Keir said the government would ""take every step we can and use all powers"" to make British Jews safe.

What we know about the attack
Holocaust survivor among victims
'My cousin was killed in Bondi Beach terror attack'
Justice minister Alex Davies-Jones travelled to Manchester to celebrate Hanukkah with survivors of October's attack, which took place on the holiest day of the year for Jews.
Around 200 members of the Manchester Jewish community gathered at the synagogue to light the menorah for Hannukah and remember the lives lost in Manchester and in Bondi.
The service was led by Rabbi Daniel Walker, who urged those present to find ""light in darkness"". The menorah was lit by the widow of Melvin Cravitz, who was killed in the attack.
Earlier, Rabbi Mirvis said he appreciated the work of the UK government and the police to protect British Jews, who he said were ""on the front line"" and had faced repeated ""terrorist attacks"".
But he urged authorities to tackle the causes of hatred, ""not just the symptoms"".
He called for people to stand together ""against the normalised rhetoric that demonises Jews and the only Jewish state"".
The chief rabbi said that ""for far too long we have allowed chants such as 'globalise the intifada'"", which he said ""incite hatred and which inspire people to engage in hate action"".
""Why is it still allowed? What is the meaning of globalise the intifada? I'll tell you the meaning... it's what happened on Bondi Beach yesterday.""
He added: ""We have to be far stricter with regard to what people are allowed to say and to do in a way which incites the hatred, which produces the violence that we have witnessed.""

The organisation that arranges security for UK Jewish communities, the Community Security Trust (CST), told the BBC that the UK has seen record levels of anti-Jewish hate crime, which began to increase immediately after the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel.
Dave Rich, the CST's head of policy, told the Today programme that ""we have had huge protests ongoing in our city centres and university campuses with language like calls for intifada"".
""Jewish people see a connection between violent words and violent actions,"" he said, adding that the Bondi attack was ""the extreme end of this political spectrum"".
Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she was ""absolutely horrified"" by the attacks.
Asked if the government was doing enough to tackle antisemitism, she said: ""I think that for several years now we have not done enough.""
The prime minister's spokesman, when asked a similar question, told reporters that there was already funding and efforts to crack down on antisemitism following the Manchester attack.
Lord West, speaking on behalf of the government, later told the House of Lords that while there was ""no specific intelligence of a linked threat"" in the UK to the Bondi attack, ""we must remain vigilant"".
Shadow attorney general Lord Wolfson - a relative of British Rabbi Eli Schlanger, who was killed on Bondi Beach - told a memorial in Parliament Square on Monday evening that the UK needed to be more muscular in fighting the root causes of antisemitic violence.
When the public health minister Ashley Dalton spoke of her solidarity with the Jewish community she was repeatedly met with boos and heckles from some of the crowd and cries of ""shame"", ""rubbish"" and ""stop the marches"".

The festival of Hanukkah commemorates how, some 2,150 years ago, a small band of Jews revolted against Emperor Antiochus, who had suppressed their faith and demanded conversion to ancient Greek religion on pain of death.
The group, led by the Maccabee family, removed Greek idols from the temple in Jerusalem and, the story goes, were able to light its menorah for eight days with only one day's oil.
Rabbi Mirvis said the message of the festival was about Jews' ""refusal to be intimidated or erased"".
""The Jewish community is nervous. The Jewish community is strong. The Jewish community is worried, but we're tenacious. You'll see us during the eight days of Hanukkah, we'll be out there.""

How Bondi's Hanukkah festival turned from joy to horror within minutes,2025-12-15T17:39:36.377Z," Johanna ChisholmandBBC Verify
","It was a night that promised to bring ""joy and light"" to Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach as crowds of Jewish families gathered at a park to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah, also known as the festival of light.
They were among thousands of other swimmers, surfers and sunbathers who had flocked to Australia's most famous beach on a scorching summer's afternoon.
But not long after the Hanukkah event kicked off at 17:00 local time and the first free donuts were doled out, festive music was drowned out by the sounds of screams and the echo of gunshots.
It's unclear exactly when the first shot was fired, but the initial call to police was made at 18:47. In the minutes that followed, two gunmen would kill at least 15 people, and injure dozens more, authorities said.
A local high school teacher, Chavi, told the BBC she dropped to the ground to protect her baby as ""bullets were flying above us"".
""It was pandemonium and chaos,"" another attendee, who identified himself as Barry, said as he described watching a throng of people trying to escape the scene that had suddenly devolved into a nightmare.
In one video verified by the BBC, upbeat music from the Hanukkah event can still be heard in the background as people crouch down and shots are heard, interspersed between shrieks.
The eerily jubilant music continues playing while the camera pans over the grass, revealing prostrate bodies completely still, their condition unclear.
Separate footage shows groups of people lying atop one another on the grass, as one woman tries to cover a young child's head with her hand.
Panic soon spread from the park to the sand, where videos show terrified beach goers sprinting away from the gunfire.
Screams, honking car horns and ambulance sirens fill the air in the next chaotic minutes. Some cars crashed as people desperately tried to get away, witnesses have told the BBC.
A nearly 11-minute video, verified by the BBC, provides perhaps the clearest timeline of the attack - though it is unclear exactly how far into it the recording started.
It begins as the two gunmen make their way across Campbell Parade - the long stretch of road, lined with cafes, that curves around the beach - and onto a pedestrian bridge above the park where the Hannukah event was taking place.
It is from there that two men - named as Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed, 24 - allegedly use the elevated position to carry out the remainder of the attack, using what an expert told the BBC were ""two sporting shotguns"".
One man, believed to be Naveed Akram, remains on the bridge, while the other makes his way towards the park on foot. Shots continue to echo at one-second intervals in some of the footage, while people can be heard screaming.
As the older man, believed to be Sajid Akram, begins to move away from the bridge, he starts firing at people.
Just a few minutes later, a passerby - who is seen crouching behind parked cars - catches Sajid off guard and is able to wrest the firearm off him within a few seconds.
The gunman stumbles away, and the man, who has been identified as Ahmed al Ahmed, points the firearm at him, before laying the weapon down against a tree and putting his hands up to signal to officers that he is not the suspect.
Ahmed, who was shot twice during the attack, has been hailed as a hero and credited by New South Wales Premier Chris Minns for saving ""countless lives"" with his brave actions.
Less than a minute after being disarmed, however, Sajid Akram returns to the bridge and resumes shooting at people with another weapon.
The shooting stops about two minutes later when it appears both men are hit by police fire.
About seven-and-a-half minutes into the clip, police arrive at the bridge where they are confronted with a highly charged scene - two men with gunshot wounds - the alleged gunmen - and a crowd of bystanders, some of whom appear to kick the men on the ground.
Police later confirmed that one of the gunmen, Sajid Akram, was found dead at the scene, while the other was critically wounded and taken to hospital, where he remains.
Police say both men lived about an hour's drive from Bondi Beach at a house in Bonnyrigg, a suburb in Sydney's west.
Days before the attack, however, they had decamped to a short-term rental in Campsie - about 30 minutes closer to the beach, media reports said.
Their family home in Bonnyrigg has become one of the main focuses of the police investigation. Officers raided it on Sunday night.
Footage of the raid shows three people coming out of it with their hands up, while heavily armed police officers in tactical gear surrounded the perimeter.
Those people were arrested, but have since been released without charge.
It is still unclear if the guns used in the attack were owned by the two men, but Sajid Akram owned six registered firearms and held a recreational gun license.
His son, Naveed, was examined over his close ties to a Sydney-based Islamic State (IS) cell after authorities became aware of his activity in 2019, the ABC reported.
But Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said an ""assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence"".
Residents on the otherwise quiet, suburban street have described how the tumult of the last 48 hours has unsettled the neighbourhood.
""My daughter was yelling at me, 'mum look outside' and I saw lots of police, lots of cars, sirens and loudspeakers calling them to come out,"" Lemanatua Fatu, who lives opposite the men, told the BBC.
""Then I saw the news - I thought oh my goodness, it can't be them.""

The Russian village that lost its men to war,2026-02-20T00:29:39.686Z," Olga Ivshina
BBC News Russian
","In the fishing village of Sedanka, in Russia's Far East, life is hard.
Most homes lack basic amenities such as running water, indoor toilets and central heating, despite temperatures routinely falling to -10C (14F) during the winter months.
Ringed by forest-tundra and bogs, its district centre can only be reached from May to October by river boat or vehicles with tracks, and in winter only by snowmobile or helicopter.
There are few local jobs and most villagers survive by fishing and growing their own food.
And now almost all of Sedanka's men aged 18 to 55 have gone, according to locals, having joined Russia's war in Ukraine.
""It's heartbreaking - so many of our people have been killed,"" says Natalia, a villager whose name we've changed for her security, in an interview with the BBC World Service.
""My sister's husband and my cousins are at the front. In almost every family, someone is fighting.""
Located on the north-west edge of the Kamchatka Peninsula, near the Sea of Okhotsk, Sedanka is more than 4,300 miles (7,000km) from Ukraine's front lines.
The American city of Anchorage, across the ocean, is roughly half that distance.
Thirty-nine men from the village signed contracts with Russia to fight in the war from a total population of 258. Of these, 12 have been killed and another seven are missing.
""All our men have left for the special military operation,"" a group of women told the regional governor when he visited in March 2024, using the Kremlin's language for its war in Ukraine.
""There is no-one to chop firewood for winter to heat our stoves,"" they added in an exchange shown on state TV.
The BBC, along with Russian news outlet Medizona and volunteer researchers, has so far verified that 40,201 Russian soldiers were killed in 2025.
According to our analysis, we estimate that the total number killed in 2025 will reach 80,000, which would be the most deadly year for Russian losses in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion was launched on 24 February 2022.
This calculation takes into account obituaries that cite 2025 as the year of death or burial, but we have not yet fully processed or cross-checked.
Confirmed deaths for 2024 now stand at 69,362 - roughly comparable to the combined totals for 2022 and 2023 - and the curve has steepened since late 2024.
We have confirmed the deaths using official reports and a probate data registry - an official registry of cases after someone dies - as well as newspaper articles, social media posts from relatives or close friends and data from new memorials and graves.
In total, the BBC has now identified the names of 186,102 Russian soldiers killed in the war.
The true death toll is generally accepted to be much higher, as many deaths on the battlefield are not recorded.
Military experts believe our analysis might represent 45-65% of the total, putting the potential number of Russian deaths at between 286,000 and 413,500.
Ukraine has also sustained heavy losses.
Last month, President Volodymyr Zelensky told French broadcaster France 2 that ""officially"" 55,000 Ukrainians had been killed on the battlefield.
In addition, a ""large number of people"" are considered officially missing, he said, though he did not give an exact figure.
Based on estimates from sources including the UA Losses website, which the BBC has cross-referenced, we estimate that the number of Ukrainians killed is as high as 200,000.
Most Russians killed in the war have Slavic surnames.
But losses are disproportionately high among small indigenous groups, especially in economically depressed areas of Siberia and the Far East, such as Sedanka.
Sedanka is home mainly to Koryaks and Itelmens - indigenous groups who, under wartime rules, can be exempted from mobilisation.
Anti-war activist Maria Vyushkova says Russian state TV amplifies stereotypes about indigenous communities being ""born warriors"" and skilled shooters in order to encourage them to join the war.
""Many indigenous communities take pride in that heritage as part of their identity. The Kremlin uses this pride to recruit for war,"" Vyushkova says.
One of the men from Sedanka who joined the conflict was Vladimir Akeev, 45, a hunter and fisherman, who signed a contract with the army in the summer of 2024.
Four months later he was killed in combat.
Mourners at his funeral in November 2024 were only able to reach the cemetery by snowmobile, and Akeev's coffin arrived on wide wooden sleds.
Elsewhere, confirmed losses from indigenous groups include 201 Nenets, 96 Chukchi, 77 Khanty, 30 Koryaks and seven Inuit.
As a proportion of males between the ages of 18 and 60, this equates to an estimated 2% of Chukchi, 1.4% of Russian Inuits, 1.32% of Koryaks and 0.8% of Khanty.
The BBC's analysis shows that 67% of the dead are from rural areas and small towns - classed as those with populations under 100,000 people - even though 48% of Russia's population lives there.
The rate of losses was smallest in major cities, with Moscow having the least deaths per capita - five people for every 10,000 males, or 0.05%.
In poorer regions, such as Buryatia in eastern Siberia, and Tuva in southern Siberia, the death rate is 27 to 33 times higher respectively than in the capital.
The main driver of this gap between cities and rural areas is the difference in economic development, pay and education, says demographer Alexey Raksha.
As a result, soldiers from poorer regions and ethnic minorities make up a larger share of the army and of the dead than the overall population, he says.
Regions with a high share of losses had lower life expectancy even before their men joined the war, another Russian demographer told the BBC.
""For many, the driver is not only poverty but a lack of prospects - the feeling that there is nothing to lose,"" he says.
In Sedanka, a monument to ""participants of the special military operation"" was unveiled in autumn 2024.
Last year, the regional government pledged to bestow the honorary title of ""village of military valour"" for the participation of its men in the war.
It also promised a support programme for families of Sedanka's soldiers.
Yet the village has still not received its honorary title nor has much of the promised support for soldiers' families arrived.
Roofs on the homes of four contract soldiers were fixed after falling into disrepair, but only after significant media attention.
One in five houses, built during Soviet times, has been deemed by the state to be unsafe.
Its sole school has been classed by officials as being in a state of emergency, with some walls at risk of collapse.
All of this has been compounded by the loss of the village's working-age men to Russia's war in Ukraine.

Wave of arrests over killing of French nationalist piles pressure on far left,2026-02-19T08:13:37.553Z," Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor
","Two more people have been detained by French authorities investigating the killing of a far-right student activist by suspected radical left militants in Lyon, bringing the total in custody to 11.
Quentin Deranque, 23, suffered a fatal brain injury when he was beaten and kicked during a protest last week on the sidelines of a conference held by Rima Hassan, a member of the European Parliament for hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI).
The wave of arrests began on Wednesday and included two parliamentary aides to LFI politician Raphaël Arnault.
Arnault said one, Jacques-Elie Favrot, had halted his work in parliament and his contract was being terminated. A second has had his rights suspended.
Prosecutors say seven of the 11 suspects are being investigated for murder and the other four for helping others to evade police.
Favrot's lawyer told reporters his client admitted being at the scene and committing violence but said ""he wasn't the one who inflicted the blows that caused Mr Deranque's death"".
Although the radical left party leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has sought to distance the party from Deranque's violent death, LFI has come under attack from rivals across the political spectrum, less than a month before France votes in key municipal elections.
Government spokesperson Maud Bregeon has urged the party to suspend Raphaël Arnault from its parliamentary group because of the MP's links to Anti-Fascist Young Guard, which has been blamed for the violence a short distance from Sciences Po University in Lyon.
The political climate is febrile ahead of the March votes - seen as the last test of public opinion before next year's presidential elections. Within the past month Sébastien Lecornu's minority government had to survive two no-confidence motions to push through this year's budget.
LFI party co-ordinator Manuel Bompard announced on Wednesday that the party's Paris HQ was briefly evacuated because of a bomb threat, and went on to accuse a large cross-section of the political and media classes of making days of false and defamatory statements.
""I call for an end to this absolutely despicable exploitation of the tragedy that took place last Thursday evening in Lyon, for which France Unbowed bears absolutely no responsibility,"" he told reporters. ""This climate should worry everybody.""
Videos captured from the scene show three people lying on the ground coming under attack from a larger group, all of them wearing hoods.
A feminist anti-immigration group called Némésis said Deranque had been outside the venue to protect its members. Némésis has blamed Young Guard for the attack - an allegation it denies.
A minute's silence was held in the National Assembly on Tuesday for the young activist, and politicians lined up to criticise the radical-left leader and his colleagues.
Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally said Mélenchon had ""moral and political responsibility"" for what had happened and even former LFI MP Alexis Corbière called on the party to take stock politically of what had happened.
Sébastien Lecornu said that ""without undermining the presumption of innocence"" LFI had to ""clean up"" its statements, ideas and its ranks fast.
Mélenchon hit back, saying he refused to take lessons from Lecornu.
However, more moderate figures on the left such as Socialist ex-President François Hollande have accused LFI of being responsible for lowering the tone of politics in France.
""It's clear there can be no alliance in the municipal elections between the Socialists or reformist left-wing parties and LFI in the second round,"" Hollande said on Wednesday. ""The relationship is over.""
For months the party had indulged in a kind of ""brutalisation"" of debate so there was no political space between the far left and far right, said Hollande.
The actions of police have also come in for criticism, as local forces were warned that Rima Hassan's event was due to take place but riot police were not on the scene at the time of the fatal attack.
The death of Deranque has prompted reaction across the border in Italy, where Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has described the attack as deeply shocking and ""a wound for the whole of Europe"".

'Difficult' Russia-Ukraine peace talks end without breakthrough,2026-02-18T22:33:48.538Z," Laura Gozzi
","Talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US aimed at ending Moscow's war in Ukraine have concluded without a breakthrough.
The trilateral meetings, held in Geneva, went on late on Tuesday but only lasted two hours on Wednesday.
Although US envoy Steve Witkoff had expressed optimism over the talks, both the chief Russian negotiator and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky indicated they had been ""difficult"".
After the main talks concluded, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky returned to the venue and held a closed-door meeting with the Ukrainian side for about an hour and a half. No details from that meeting have emerged.
Some progress was made on ""military issues"", including the location of the front line and ceasefire monitoring, according to a Ukrainian diplomatic source.
White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said later on Wednesday that ""there was meaningful progress"" made on both sides, and an agreement to ""continue to work towards a peace deal together"".
But an agreement on the issue of territory - without which no ceasefire can be envisaged - remains elusive, with Moscow and Kyiv's positions still far apart.
Russia has not budged in its demand for full control of the eastern Donbas region - made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - which is a non-starter for Ukraine.
While conceding talks were challenging, Kremlin negotiator Vladimir Medinsky added that they had been ""businesslike"" and said another meeting would take place ""soon"".
Zelensky also described the negotiations as ""not easy"" due to the difference in the two sides' positions.
Rustem Umerov cut a less downbeat tone, saying the discussions had been ""substantive and intensive"" and that while there had been progress, no details could be disclosed ""at this stage"".
""This is complex work that requires alignment among all parties and sufficient time,"" Umerov said.
Shortly before the end of the talks was announced, Zelensky accused Russia of ""trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage"".
The Russian and Ukrainian delegations last met in US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi earlier in February, which led to the first prisoner exchange in several months. On Wednesday, Zelensky indicated that another swap might be forthcoming.
US President Donald Trump, who spearheaded diplomatic efforts to end the war, has been signalling impatience with the deadlock between the two sides.
On Monday, he said Ukraine had ""better come to the table, fast"" - a sentiment Zelensky has since rejected, saying it was ""not fair"" that his country should be the one asked to compromise.
Four years on from the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, substantial distance still exists between Moscow's demands and what Kyiv might consider a ""just peace"".
Kyiv has long rejected Russia's demand for the eastern Donbas, which would mean relinquishing Ukrainian sovereign territory, including several heavily fortified cities and a long defensive line in the region of Donetsk.
Many Ukrainians believe giving that territory up would leave the country vulnerable to another Russian invasion. Zelensky himself has drawn parallels with the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler annex the Czech territory of Sudetenland.
On Tuesday, Zelensky told US media outlet Axios that any plan to hand over the Donbas would be rejected by Ukrainians if it were put to a referendum.
The Ukrainian president is also working to ensure that robust security guarantees to deter Russia from attacking again are provided by Kyiv's western allies.
Another sticking point in the talks is the status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. Ukraine wants Moscow to return it and Zelensky has previously said Kyiv could share control of the plant with the Americans - an arrangement Moscow is unlikely to agree to.
Officials from Britain, France, Germany and Italy were present in Geneva and held talks with the Ukrainians on the sidelines of the trilateral meeting.
European representatives have struggled to be included in the US-led negotiations, but Zelensky said European participation was ""indespensable"" for any final agreement.
In a wide-ranging interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored on Wednesday, Zelensky confirmed there would be more talks in Switzerland and repeated that while progress had been made from a military perspective, ""on the political direction it's more difficult"".
During the interview, he also said he could not really ""understand"" Trump's relationship with the Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding ""for me it's very, very painful that his attitude to Putin is sometimes...more good than Putin deserves"".
Next Tuesday will mark the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The war, which has resulted in tens of thousands of military and civilian casualties and displaced millions across Ukraine, continues to shape the lives of Ukrainians, with daily deadly aerial attacks across the country.
Four people were killed and 30 injured in Russian artillery and air strikes overnight on Tuesday. Power infrastructure too continues to be targeted across the country, leaving millions without light or heating in one of Ukraine's coldest winters in years.

More than 90 deaths this season: Are we seeing more avalanches?,2026-02-19T21:57:01.884Z," Robert Greenall
BBC News
","It is not unusual for avalanches to be in the news in the northern hemisphere at this time of year, the height of the annual ski season.
But Tuesday's deadly incident in California, which took the lives of eight skiers and left one more unaccounted for, and the difficult situation in much of the Alps - where there have been more fatalities than usual this year - has put a spotlight on avalanches and how prepared winter sports enthusiasts should be for them.
The two situations would seem to be very different. California has been coming out of a so-called snow drought and experts do not consider the latest snowfall exceptional.
But droughts followed by intense snow can cause problems - the new snow is unable to bind to old snow underneath, which can either be very hard or non-existent, and therefore remains loose.

Europe, however, has seen two major storms in a week and a large amount of heavy snow combined with strong winds, leading to high avalanche warning levels across an unusually large part of the Alps. Three Britons were among dozens killed in incidents so far over the season.
One Alpine resort suggested that the current conditions could be the worst there this century.
Recent snows have also led to evacuations of several communities in Switzerland and northern Italy, as well as power outages and a train derailment at Goppenstein in the south-western Swiss canton of Valais.
But is there a connection between events in Europe and California?
Climate change might seem an obvious culprit for the unstable weather conditions that have brought them about.
""There is evidence that climate change will lead to sharper, more intense precipitation followed by long periods without,"" Simon Mason, senior scientist at SEI US, told the BBC.
This would seem to be the case in Europe, which has recently had several seasons with lower than average snowfall, and some dry periods in the early part of this season.
""However, since many factors control avalanche risk and precipitation is only one controlling influence, it is difficult to conclude how risks may evolve with future climate change,"" Mason said.
Climatologist Christoph Marthy told Swiss outlet SRF the current Alpine winter - with weather until recently dominated by high pressure and several long, dry periods - is exactly the opposite of a typical climate change winter.
Benjamin Zweifel, of the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, told the BBC the storms were ""only one piece of the puzzle"".
""The main challenge this winter was a very weak snowpack [an accumulation of snow that compresses and melts seasonally] with very persistent weak layers, caused by long periods without new snow and low temperatures,"" he said.
While global warming affects weather patterns, the temperature itself could also have a direct impact on avalanches. According to the US Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, wet snow avalanches - which are likely to become more frequent as temperatures rise - are dangerous, difficult to predict and relatively poorly understood compared with the dry snow equivalent.
""Wet snow avalanches are caused by weakening in the strength of the snowpack, often triggered by rain, abundant sunshine, or warm temperatures,"" the centre says in an article on wet snow avalanche research, adding their frequency was expected to increase with changing temperatures.
A 2021 research paper in the journal Frontiers in Physiology suggests wetter and warmer snow may also adversely affect a person's chances of surviving an avalanche, while thinner snow cover may increase the risk of blunt trauma injuries.
Broadly, there would seem to be four destabilising issues that are changing the dynamics of avalanches - switching between droughts and heavy precipitation, the precipitation itself, wetter snow and snow which is actually melting.
Blaise Agresti, a high-mountain guide at Chamonix, told France's Sud radio that there was another important factor in Europe's spike in avalanche deaths - the changing behaviour of skiers and higher levels of risk.
""People are increasingly practising off-piste skiing. Among skiers, 25% go off-piste,"" he said.
Way-marked pistes are generally protected by pre-emptive avalanche blasting, and their snow is flattened and compacted to further reduce the risk. If there is still a danger of avalanches, pistes can be closed off, as has happened during the recent warnings.
But while forecasting and blasting techniques have improved in recent years, it is not impossible for avalanches to hit pistes that have been declared safe. There is no such thing as zero risk, and it may be advisable to keep away from pistes beneath mountainsides covered with powdery-looking snow.
Sometimes resorts can detect a wider threat. The French resorts of Tignes and Val d'Isere even imposed a lockdown because of the avalanche threat, forcing residents and tourists to stay indoors.
In general, though, resorts will not prevent tourists from going off-piste so instead they offer advice. Another French resort, La Plagne, for instance, tells skiers to get information about conditions, make sure they have the necessary safety gear - avalanche transceiver, shovel and probe - know how to use them, and always go out with a professional guide and never alone.
The resort, which has one of the world's largest off-piste areas, holds weekly safety days in high season and has recently invested in a drone equipped with a thermal camera for use in avalanche detection and rescue operations.


Thomas Hager, a ski guide based in the Zell am See region in the Austrian Alps, told the BBC World Service's Outside Source programme that sometimes it was easy for snow sports enthusiasts to be complacent.
""Snow looks so calm. It's comparable to water,"" he said. ""In an ocean you don't see undercurrents but local people know where the undercurrents are and where avalanches go off frequently. So please always talk with local people and listen to the avalanche forecast.""
He also suggested it was vital to carry an air-bag, which is not required by law but could help keep avalanche victims close to the surface of the snow.
Though the recent spike in avalanche deaths in Europe is worrying, it is not exceptional - according to European Avalanche Warning Services, 95 have died so far this season, compared to 70 in the whole of 2024-24 and 87 in 2023-24. The 2020-21 season, when 131 died, and 2017-18, when the figure was 147, seem comparable.
But if you ask weather watchers about the situation, a different picture emerges. Meteo France's team in Bourg-Saint-Maurice near the Italian border, told the BBC the region went from below-average snowfall to ""remarkable"" above-average snowfall in under 10 days.
""Statistically speaking, we experience a situation like this once every eight years. This means a very significant avalanche risk,"" it said.
Meanwhile the Val d'Isere resort, in its Thursday weather bulletin, said a third wave of 30-50cm (12in-20in) of snow - after the two storms - would have to be taken very seriously and required ""certain precautions"".
""The situation has not been seen for a long time (perhaps since February 1999),"" it added.
So have modern avalanche-warning systems and safety measures taken by resorts in recent years kept casualty figures down?
Benjamin Zweifel believes the situation could be a lot worse without these factors, and says he sees a ""big effect"", at least in Switzerland.
He notes, though, that France and Italy have both seen higher fatalities - 25 in each, compared to Switzerland's 13 - but says this could be linked to ""even more challenging conditions"" in the western and southern Alps.
The worst could be over, though. The weather is expected to improve from Friday, giving resorts the space to carry out more safety work and allowing the snowpack to settle.
However, sunny, south-facing slopes will lose some of their snow, potentially leading to greater risks for off-pisters.

Veteran dissident who refused exile released,2026-02-19T20:15:42.773Z," Jaroslav Lukiv
","Belarus has released jailed veteran opposition politician Mikola Statkevich, who refused to go into exile last year in a US-brokered prisoner release.
The 69-year-old was now at home and recovering from a stroke which had affected his speech, his wife Marina Adamovich said.
Statkevich spent more than five years behind bars after receiving a 14-year sentence for organising what the authorities called ""mass riots"" in 2020-21. He had run unsuccessfully against Alexander Lukashenko in a 2010 presidential poll.
More than 1,000 political prisoners remain in jail in Belarus, rights groups say.
""He is at home, recovering,"" Adamovich said on Thursday.
""I really hope that everything will be fine. The main problem at the moment is his speech. It's bad, it's difficult to have a conversation.""
Meanwhile, exiled Belarusian leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she was relieved that Statkevich ""is free and able to hug his wife, who waited for him for so long"".
""I want to thank everyone who keeps fighting to release all political prisoners in Belarus. We must continue until every last one is free,"" she added in a post on X.
Statkevich was one of 52 prisoners freed last year in Belarus, following an appeal from US President Donald Trump.
They were jailed in 2020-21, when Lukashenko brutally stamped out protests after claiming victory in presidential elections that were widely condemned as rigged.
Most agreed to be sent abroad into exile. Statkevich was the only one who refused to leave the country.
In exchange for the prisoner release, the US pledged to relieve some sanctions on Belarusian airline Belavia, allowing it to buy parts for its aircraft.
Belarus is a close ally of Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Lukashenko has been in power in Belarus since 1994, quashing all opposition.

Gaffe-ridden Olympic commentary prompts Italy's Rai sport chief to resign,2026-02-19T13:10:43.269Z," Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor
","It was a moment of national pride for Italians watching the glitzy opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics live on state broadcaster Rai earlier this month.
But for Paolo Petrecca, whose gaffe-ridden commentary of the event went viral and became a national embarrassment, it signalled the end of his broadcasting career.
Petrecca, the head of Rai Sport, has handed in his resignation after his litany of on-air errors broadcast to an audience of 9.2 million viewers prompted a brief strike by news journalists.
His tenure will end at the end of the Games, and he will not be commentating on the closing ceremony.
Petrecca had been a last-minute stand-in, because the original commentator was dropped for revealing a ""sensational surprise"" element of the ceremony by mistake.
He is considered close to the Brothers of Italy party of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and, while running Rai's news channel, presented her book I Am Giorgia to the public a year before she came to office.
His broadcast had barely begun before he made his first mistake, welcoming viewers to the Stadio Olimpico, instead of Milan's fabled San Siro which had been chosen for the curtain-raising ceremony.
What happened next was described by one reviewer as one of Rai's bleakest ever live broadcasts, when its flagship Rai 1 channel had an audience share of more than 46%.
He introduced singer Mariah Carey, before correcting himself and explaining it was in fact Italian actress Matilda De Angelis.
His gaffe went viral, as Italians posted images of De Angelis with the slogan ""here's the amazing Mariah Carey!"" De Angelis herself went on social media to suggest sharing the rights to Carey's song All I Want for Christmas.
When the camera fixed on President Sergio Mattarella, Petrecca referred to the president's daughter Laura beside him applauding, when the woman in the frame was in fact the president of the International Olympic Committee Kirsty Coventry.
When the Olympic torch was handed to Italy's two highly successful volleyball teams, he failed to recognise men's volleyball captain Simone Giannelli, naming one member of the women's team.
And he then resorted to national stereotypes, saying Brazilians had music in their blood, referring to African ""voodoo rites"" and Spaniards who were ""always very hot"", using the Spanish word calienti.
Petrecca's disastrous performance was condemned by Rai's journalists' union Usigrai as a ""serious blow"" to the public broadcaster's image and the commentator who had been dropped for the curtain-raiser, Auro Bulbarelli, has since been given back the job for the closing ceremony.
His decision to hand in his resignation was not unexpected and he will be replaced by colleague Marco Lollobrigida, considered one of the broadcaster's top sport presenters.
But the affair has highlighted what critics argue is the government's attempt to pressurise the broadcaster at the expense of output quality, dubbing Rai TV as TeleMeloni.

"Spain luxury hotel scammer booked rooms for one cent, police say",2026-02-18T16:34:44.189Z," Robert Greenall
","Spanish police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of hacking a hotel booking website and reserving luxury rooms priced at up to €1,000 ($1,180; £870) per night for just one euro cent.
He was detained while staying at a Madrid hotel, where he was accused of racking up charges of more than €20,000 during several stays.
Police said the alleged crime involved altering the payment validation system, and was the first of its kind to be detected.
Their investigation began after suspicious activity was reported by a travel booking site. It took just four days to complete - the Spanish outlet ABC reported that the suspect used his real identity to make the reservations.
According to police, the suspect is believed to have sabotaged the payment system via a cyber attack, getting the system to authorise his transaction after entering only one cent as the charged amount.
Police said that the transaction had at first appeared to have been carried out correctly. The irregularity was only discovered when the payment platform transferred the actual amount - €0.01 - to the hotel company.
Four days later, police located the suspect at the Madrid hotel and arrested him. His latest stay there was for four nights, normally costing €4,000.
They said the man had also consumed mini-bar items during his stays and left other bills unpaid.
The police statement appears to suggest that bookings had been made at other hotels, though no details were given.
ABC reported that the suspect had previously been arrested in the Canary Islands, where he had also stayed at a luxury hotel.

Food prices are surging in Russia. Is the war hitting Russians in the pocket?,2026-02-18T00:19:54.437Z," Olga Shamina
Yaroslava KiryukhinaandSergei Kagermazov
BBC News Russian
","""Life is becoming more expensive,"" complains Alexander, a Moscow-based advertising specialist who works for a big corporation.
In the course of one month his monthly food budget soared by more than 22% - from 35,000 roubles (£330; $450) to 43,000 (£406; $555).
With Russia's economy hanging somewhere between stagnation and decline, ordinary Russians have begun to feel the pinch from the Kremlin's war on Ukraine, as it approaches its fourth anniversary.
The cost of almost all essentials has gone up in local supermarkets, from eggs and chicken fillets to seasonal vegetables, Alexander has noticed. We have changed the names of everyone we have spoken to for this piece.
Even his daily treat on the way to work - an Americano from a local cafe - has suddenly surged 26% from 230 to 290 roubles.
Prices have risen steadily in Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in Ukraine, driven by a federal budget dominated by the war effort and defence industry.
This in turn has led to rapid economic growth and raised living standards across the country.
Until now, high levels of inflation have gone largely unnoticed by the general population, especially in the big cities such as Moscow and St Petersburg. Big spending masked the mounting economic consequences of the war, as well as Western sanctions and the exodus of foreign investment from Russia.
That rapid economic growth slowed sharply in 2025, and as salaries could no longer keep up with inflation, rising prices started to hit people's pockets.
Then at the start of 2026, supermarket prices jumped by a sharp 2.3% in less than a month, according to data from Russia's statistics service Rosstat.
Everything became more expensive at the start of the year: meat, milk, salt, flour, potatoes, pasta, bananas, soap, toothpaste, socks, laundry detergent, and many medicines too.
Every other January since 2019, the BBC has bought the same selection of 59 basic goods from the same supermarket chain, Pyaterochka, in Moscow. The basket includes vegetables and fruits, dairy and meat products, canned goods and instant noodles, sweets and beverages, including beer.
In 2024, the basket cost 7,358 roubles (£63; $83). Last month, it cost 8,724 (£83; $112) roubles - an increase of 18.6%.
That tallies with Rosstat's own 18.1% measure of overall accumulated food inflation from January 2024 to the end of January 2026.
One of the most noticeable price increases in our basket has been a hike of almost 15% in the cost of fruit and vegetables since 2024.
Russia relies on imported fruit and vegetables, so store prices are highly sensitive to fluctuations in the rouble exchange rate and disruptions in the supply chain. Both occurred after the beginning of the war in Ukraine.
At the same time, the price of dairy products - which tend to be locally produced - has soared 41%, the biggest rise in our sample basket in the last two years. This is because Russia's dairy industry has been hit by rising farm costs, expensive loans and staff shortages.
The most recent factor influencing price rises is a two-point increase in VAT from 20% to 22% since 1 January.
The sales tax hike is directly related to the war in Ukraine, as Russia's finance ministry said it was needed to finance the country's ""defence and security"".
While Alexander from Moscow told the BBC he was not going to change his eating habits, others say rising food prices have hit their diets and family budgets significantly.
Nadezhda, 68, says she can no longer afford to buy beef and has resorted to cheap varieties of fish.
She and her husband, who are both retired, live in Moscow on their state pensions and his additional income. Nadezhda says her entire monthly pension of almost 32,000 roubles (£302; $413) now goes on food.
That means other expenses have been put on hold.
They had been saving to fix their car, but recently had to rely on savings to pay for food. Similarly, buying a new winter jacket for Nadezhda's husband, which would have cost about 17,000 roubles (£160; $220), will have to wait until next year.
Kristina, a Moscow marketing specialist in her mid-40s, also had dig into her savings to buy food last month. She lives with her husband, who is a personal trainer, and says she has started paying attention to discounts and has noticed others in supermarkets doing so as well.
""Now I take a very pragmatic approach: not what I want or don't want to eat, but how much protein is in 100 grams of this product,"" Kristina says.
She and her husband can no longer afford to eat out, but even when cooking at home, the price of a dinner for two has more than doubled - from around 1,000 roubles (£9.46; $12.92) to more than 2,000 roubles (£18.91; $25.85).
In summer 2025, Russia's Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said that the economy was close to a ""scenario of balanced rates of economic growth"".
However, some economists suggest that after slowing down significantly last year, the Russian economy is now at risk of going into the red.
One of the main risks this year will come from the oil market.
The federal budget is based on a high oil price, but market rates have fallen since the start of this year and there is no expectation of any imminent rise.
Russian oil sales have also been hit by latest US sanctions that have cut off supplies to one of Moscow's main trading partners, India.
As a result, Russian authorities are likely to face a bigger budget deficit than they had planned.
Borrowing is difficult due to high interest rates - few are willing to lend to a country currently waging war and with a reputation for being unreliable.
That could mean further unpopular measures - either further tax rises, which would hurt people and businesses, or cutting budget spending, primarily in the public sector. That would slow down the economy and bring down household incomes further.
""Overall, there is a trend towards stagnation and a possible decline in GDP,"" Tatiana Mikhailova, an economist and visiting assistant professor at Penn State University, told the BBC.
For the moment nothing indicates the economy is in decline, but she believes there is a high likelihood of it happening.
""Every time oil prices fall, a recession is possible in Russia,"" she says, even if she believes the economy can carry on without growth for some time.
That may be of little comfort to ordinary Russians, who will still feel the effects in their pockets.

Third Briton dies in French Alps avalanches in one week,2026-02-18T05:01:02.812Z," Yang Tian
","A British national was among at least three people killed in two avalanches in the French Alps on Tuesday.
The man in his 30s and another Polish citizen were part of a group of five people who were skiing off-piste near the resort town of La Grave when the avalanche struck.
Several hikers were also caught up in a second avalanche in the neighbouring Valloire area where one person was killed and two others were left in critical condition, according to authorities.
The latest incidents bring the death toll to 28 for this winter season at the popular skiing destination, and comes after two other Britons and a French national died on Friday.
Two other skiers who where part of the group in La Grave, a German and an Australian, escaped without injury.
On Tuesday, the French weather service marked the avalanche risk in the La Greve area as ""high"" or four on a five-point scale due to fresh snow and wind.
At the Valloire resort, the risk was categorised at the maximum of five.
Local authorities have launched investigations to determine the cause of death in both avalanches.
Following the deaths of the two British nationals on Friday, a spokesperson for the Foreign Office told the BBC they were ""in contact with the local authorities and stand ready to offer consular assistance"".
There have been a number of fatal avalanches in the French Alps since the start of the year, including six deaths in one weekend in January.

Italian toddler in critical condition after transplanted heart 'burned by frostbite',2026-02-17T12:43:57.522Z," Laura Gozzi
","A toddler in Italy remains in critical condition after undergoing a transplant with a damaged heart.
The organ, which was transported south from the city of Bolzano to Naples in December, was reportedly placed in an unsuitable container and in direct contact with dry ice, leading to severe tissue damage. The box also lacked a thermometer that could alert the medical team to the low temperature.
The heart, which came from another young boy who drowned, arrived ""burned by frostbite,"" the child's family's lawyer, Francesco Petruzzi, said.
Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident and six medics have been placed under formal investigation.
The heart transplant went ahead in December but the child, who is just over two years old, had to be placed on life support shortly afterwards.
He is now in a ""stable but critical condition"", according to the hospital where he is being treated.
The longer the boy is kept on life support, the more serious the complications to his lungs, liver and kidneys could be.
On Wednesday, a team of specialist doctors from major hospitals around Italy will convene to decide whether the child's current conditions make him suitable for a new transplant.
""I am not giving up,"" his mother Patrizia Mercolino told Italian media, adding she hoped the child could still be eligible for another donor heart.
She has appealed to the Pope for help in finding a new organ for her son.
Her lawyer said that if the doctors deemed another transplant not viable, the family would seek a third opinion.
""We must absolutely clarify what happened,"" said health minister Orazio Schillaci. ""We owe it to the child, to the family, but also to all Italians.""
""We have an excellent national health service which has been able to handle and almost always resolve complex situations. So, I believe citizens should not lose faith.""

Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia,2026-02-19T16:49:08.000Z," the Visual Journalism team
BBC News
","The war in Ukraine is about to enter its fifth year. Over the past year, Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control, mostly in the east of Ukraine, and have continued their barrage of air strikes on Kyiv and other cities.
Some 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, while the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side.
With the fourth anniversary of the Russia's full-scale invasion approaching, here's a look at the situation on the ground in Ukraine.
Analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), say Russia took about 4,700 sq km (1,800 sq miles) of territory in 2025 - an area about twice the size of the city of Moscow - although Russia claims to have taken 6,000 sq km.
In eastern Ukraine, Moscow's war machine has been churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - also known as the Donbas - surrounding and overwhelming villages and towns.
It has been trying to gain full control of the area along with two more regions to the west - Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Shortly after the invasion, Russia held referendums to try to annexe all these regions - in the same way it had annexed Crimea in 2014 - but it has never had them under full control.
There is some evidence that Elon Musk's decision to deny Russian forces access to his Starlink satellite-based internet service at the start of February has given Ukraine an advantage.
Ukraine requested the move as evidence grew that Starlink was enabling Russian forces to mount increasingly accurate attacks, including multiple instances of units being attached to drones, allowing operators to use real-time video links to guide drones on to targets.
In some areas of the long front line, especially east of the city of Zaporizhzhia, Russian forces appear to have been forced to retreat.
Ukraine hopes that any territorial gains will strengthen the its position at the negotiating table.
It comes after a US-backed peace plan unveiled in November, suggested Ukraine could cede control of all of Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea, along with the areas of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson that Russia currently occupies, to Moscow.
Ukrainian forces would have had to withdraw from parts of Donetsk they still hold and this would become a demilitarised area under de facto Russian control. Russian forces would withdraw from the small areas of Ukraine they currently occupy outside those regions.
Zelensky has consistently said Ukraine will not hand over the Donbas in exchange for peace, saying such a concession could be used as a springboard for future attacks by Russia.
A recent report by the ISW describes a ""fortress belt"" running 50km (31 miles) through western Donetsk.
""Ukraine has spent the last 11 years pouring time, money, and effort into reinforcing the fortress belt and establishing significant defence industrial and defensive infrastructure,"" it writes.
A Russian summer offensive near the eastern town of Pokrovsk did make rapid advances just north of the town and Russia has recently made advances in the town itself and to the east of nearby Kostyantynivka.
The town, once a key logistics hub for Ukraine's military, is already in ruins.
Russian officials previously claimed to have captured Pokrovsk, known in Russian as Krasnoarmeysk, which includes a major road and railway junction that used to connect the upper parts of the Donetsk region with key cities to the west, such as Dnipro.
But Ukraine says it still holds northern parts of the town, which could give Moscow a platform to drive north towards the two biggest remaining Ukrainian-controlled cities in the Donetsk region, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.
Its fall would be Russia's biggest battlefield victory since it took the city of Avdiivka about 40km (25 miles) to the east in early 2024.
Ukraine is losing ground, but the ISW notes Russia has been trying to take Pokrovsk - a town of about 23 sq km - for nearly two years and that cities in the fortress belt are ""significantly larger"".
It suggests that it would take Russian forces another two years to seize the remainder of the Donetsk region ""at great cost"".
Why Donetsk 'fortress belt' matters so much for Ukraine's defences
Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?

Further north on the main front line, Russia has been trying to advance on the city of Kupyansk, which analysts suggest could allow it to encircle the northern Donetsk region.
It has also been trying to push Ukrainian forces back from the border with the Russian region of Belgorod.
ISW analysts say Russia is trying to create a buffer zone inside Ukraine's northern borders and get within artillery range of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city.
Russia's forces have recently gained limited control over a spear of land to the south of Vovchansk that would bring them closer to this target.
Russian President Vladimir Putin says he wants this buffer zone to protect Russia, after Ukrainian forces captured a swathe of territory further north in Kursk in the summer of 2024. Russian forces eventually drove them out, with the help of North Korean troops.
As well as the counter-offensive in the Kursk region, Ukraine has struck air bases deep inside Russia. One of these attacks involved using 100 drones to target nuclear-capable long-range bombers.
The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the attacks had occurred in five regions of Russia - Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur - but stated planes had been damaged only in Murmansk and Irkutsk, while in other locations the attacks had been repelled.
More recently a massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Volzhsky, in the Volgograd region in Russia, was reported on 11 Febriuary.
Deep strikes are seen as a critical part of the war - Ukraine is trying to target Russia's war economy to slow the advances on the front line.
Russia has also been carrying out strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure - in particular its energy facilities such as electricity substations and power plants.
Several people have been killed in the attacks and tens of thousands of people across Ukraine have experienced severe power cuts or been left with no running water or heating during some of the coldest months of the winter.
The attacks were paused for a week following a request from US President Donald Trump to Putin.
Trump has been leading efforts to end the war through negotiations, and Zelensky said this month that the US wanted the war to end by June.
However, the most recent round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US in Geneva, Switzerland, concluded without a breakthrough on 18 February.
Some progress was made on ""military issues"", including the location of the front line and ceasefire monitoring, according to a Ukrainian diplomatic source.
White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said later that ""there was meaningful progress"" made on both sides, and an agreement to ""continue to work towards a peace deal together"".
But an agreement on the issue of territory - without which no ceasefire can be envisaged - remains elusive, with Moscow and Kyiv's positions still far apart.
Russia's full-scale invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.
Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv.
Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.
But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly-motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.
Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.
By October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and, having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson.
Since then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months.
Both Kyiv and Moscow have regularly published estimates of the other side's losses but they have been reluctant to detail their own.
As of six months ago, Ukraine's interior ministry had recorded more than 70,000 people as officially missing - both soldiers and civilians - but the breakdown is never given and the true figure may be higher. However, Zelensky said at the start of February that 55,000 soldiers had been killed.

To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project.
The situation in Ukraine is often fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.

Musk cuts Starlink access for Russian forces - giving Ukraine an edge at the front,2026-02-19T01:39:55.993Z," Paul Adams
Diplomatic correspondent in Kyiv
","Evidence is mounting that Elon Musk's decision to deny Russian forces access to his Starlink satellite-based internet service has blunted Moscow's advance, caused confusion among Russian soldiers and handed an advantage to Ukraine's defenders.
But for how long? And what can Ukraine's military achieve in the meantime?
""The Russians… lost their ability to control the field,"" a Ukrainian drone operator who goes by the callsign Giovanni told us.
""I think they lost 50% of their capacity for offence,"" he said. ""That's what the numbers show. Fewer assaults, fewer enemy drones, fewer everything.""
It's still early to assess the impact of a change that only came into effect at the beginning of the month, after Ukraine's defence minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, asked Elon Musk's SpaceX company to block Russian access to Starlink.
But in some areas of the long front line, especially east of the city of Zaporizhzhia, there is some evidence of Russian forces being forced to retreat.
The request from Federov came as evidence mounted that use of Starlink was enabling Russian forces to mount increasingly accurate attacks, including multiple instances of $400 (£300) units being attached to drones, allowing operators to use real-time video links to guide drones onto targets.
SpaceX's satellite communications have proved vital to both armies during the four-year war. It's widely believed that a deadly Russian attack on a moving passenger train in the Kharkiv region last month involved a Geran-2 drone, equipped with a Starlink terminal.
But since 1 February, all that has changed. SpaceX switched off all terminals operating in Ukraine, except those on a ""white list"" approved by the Defence Ministry in Kyiv.
Private users across the country had to re-register their units, along with their personal ID numbers, before being reconnected.
At this point, Ukrainian online activists from volunteer group InformNapalm decided to exploit the situation, launching a successful phishing operation that persuaded Russian soldiers to reveal details of their Starlink terminals.
""When people started messaging us, we directed them to closed group chats,"" says Mykhailo Makaruk, spokesman for InformNapalm. ""We wanted to show that it was top secret.""
Makaruk says his group successfully identified 2,425 Starlink terminals, from the Crimean peninsula in the south to the city of Gomel in eastern Belarus.
Believing they were on a fast track to having their terminals reconnected, some soldiers were even tricked into making online payments totalling $5,000.
Once the locations of the terminals close to the front lines had been established, many were targeted by Ukrainian artillery and drones.
Amid reports that Russian soldiers were attempting to bribe Ukrainian collaborators to register Starlink terminals on their behalf, InformNapalm identified around 30 people who had been ready to share their data.
A week ago, Ukraine's Security Service, the SBU, said it was ""actively countering Russian attempts to recruit Ukrainian citizens for the illegal registration of Starlink systems"".
The SBU has warned all Ukrainians ""to remain vigilant and not fall for such provocations"", warning that collaboration with Russia is regarded as high treason and can lead to lengthy prison sentences.
Makaruk says Russia's FSB Security Service is issuing its own warnings, telling soldiers not to fall for the scam, but he says the phishing operation has had a disruptive psychological effect.
""They don't trust each other anymore,"" he says, sharing screenshots of expletive-laden Russian chats in which the dangers of keeping a Starlink terminal nearby are discussed.
On the battle front, Ukrainian soldiers have noticed a difference too.
Deprived of Starlink's high speed, jam-resistant internet connectivity, their Russian opponents have been scrambling to find workarounds.
""In our area, they began to use radio communication,"" one told the BBC, on condition of anonymity. ""It became easier to understand their actions.""
Signs of hasty Russian adaptation have been observed up and down the long front line.
""The Russians are now urgently switching to wired communication,"" another told us.
Artem, a soldier with an engineering unit, said his Russian opponents were struggling to guide their drones as effectively as before.
""This is important for the protection of our critical infrastructure, logistics and control points,"" he said. ""The Russians have lost frontline communications in many places.""
Ukrainian military analysts say the impact on drone strikes on Ukrainian logistics and positions far from the front is crucial.
""Russian drone operators [used] to control and directly strike selected targets 100-250 kilometres from the front line,"" said Serhii Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Co-operation Centre.
""Now they no longer have this capability.""
In a war where the speed of communication can mean the difference between life and death, some Ukrainian soldiers sense this is a moment of real opportunity.
""If we can beat the enemy's command transmission by even five or 10 seconds, it's a total game-changer at the front,"" one told us.
Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) has published what it says are intercepts of Russian communications, which it says illustrate the frustration at the failure of some home-grown systems to compensate for the lack of Starlink.
""From what I know, this 'Gazprom' [terminal] is just total crap,"" one Russian soldier is quoted as saying, apparently referring to equipment produced by Gazprom Space Systems, using its own Yamal satellites.
The BBC is not able to verify the source of the alleged intercept.
HUR's conclusion, in a press release on Tuesday, was that the shutdown of Starlink ""has already led to serious problems with unit co-ordination, logistics, and the deployment of various unmanned systems – from ground-based to aerial drones.""
Videos circulating on social media, which the BBC has not verified, purport to show Russian soldiers being targeted by Ukrainian drones while attempting to rig up alternative wi-fi bridges on electricity bridges and TV towers.
Not all Ukrainian soldiers are convinced that the situation has changed dramatically, with some saying they have noticed little difference, or suggesting that other factors, including the weather and planned troop rotations, may also be at play.
""Drone and artillery shelling continue as before,"" one told us.
In Moscow, Russian military officials, speaking on state TV, said the loss of Starlink had not affected their operations, with one claiming that Starlink had only been used by a handful of units, ""primarily to mislead the enemy"".
Speaking to the BBC from his position close to the contested eastern city of Pokrovsk, Giovanni said it wouldn't be long before the Russians figured out a solution.
""I have no doubt they will adapt,"" he said.
How long this will take is anyone's guess.
In the meantime, Ukrainian forces are trying to take as much advantage as possible, attempting to expand the dangerous expanse of no-man's land between the two sides, an area often described as the ""grey zone"" or ""kill zone"".
""We're clearing up the grey zone now,"" Vlad Voloshyn, spokesman for the army's Southern Command, told the BBC.
""We try to strike the enemy wherever they are.""
Voloshyn disputed media reports that Ukraine had launched a major counter-offensive, recapturing more than 200 sq km (77 sq miles) of territory in a matter of days last week. The goals, he said, were more modest.
""We didn't let the enemy entrench in the grey zone and we stopped their storm groups,"" he said.
Former Ukrainian intelligence officer Ivan Stupak says the military probably has a couple of months in which to exploit the current situation.
""The Russian armoured forces on the ground are partly blind and partly deaf,"" he says. ""Maybe they will be so frustrated and demoralised that even a small counter-offensive could be on the same scale as 2022.""
A repeat of the lightning successes of the summer and autumn of 2022, when Ukrainian forces retook huge swathes of territory in the north and the south, seems unlikely at this point.
But Stupak says any territorial gains will strengthen the Ukrainian leader's position at the negotiating table.
""We could repulse Russian forces, regain our territory and then we could start this negotiation, but with new cards,"" he says.

"Facing a demographic catastrophe, Ukraine is paying for troops to freeze their sperm",2026-02-17T01:10:57.742Z," Sarah Rainsford
Southern and Eastern Europe correspondent
Kyiv
","Maxim doesn't mind discussing his sperm. In fact, he wishes more in Ukraine's military would talk about their fertility – or at least think about it.
""Our men are dying. The Ukrainian gene pool is dying. This is about the survival of our nation,"" the soldier tells me, speaking by phone from a position somewhere near the eastern frontline.
The 35-year-old is serving with Ukraine's National Guard and when he returned on leave recently his wife persuaded him to visit a clinic in Kyiv and leave a sperm sample.
It was frozen free of charge as part of a programme to help serving soldiers.
If Maxim were killed, his wife could use the sample to try to have the child they've always wanted.
But he says his frozen sperm could be crucial to creating a family, in any case.
""Whether you are right on the 'zero point' of the frontline, or 30 or even 80 kilometres back, there is no guarantee that you're safe,"" the soldier says, explaining that Russian drones overhead are a constant threat.
""That means stress, and this [can have] an impact: your reproductive ability declines. So we have to think about the future and the future of our Ukrainian nation.""
Private fertility clinics began offering what's known as cryopreservation to servicemen and women in 2022 at the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.
They could freeze their sperm or eggs for free in case they were injured in action or their fertility was affected.
The following year parliament stepped in to regulate the practice and provide state funding.
""Our soldiers are defending our future, but may lose their own, so we wanted to give them that chance,"" is how MP Oksana Dmitrieva describes the law she helped draft.
""It's to support them, so they can use their sperm later.""
The politicians' initial efforts caused a public outcry though, when they stipulated that all samples should be destroyed on a donor's death. That came to light when a war widow tried to have a child using her husband's frozen sperm and was blocked.
The law has since been amended so that all soldiers' samples are preserved for free for up to 3 years after their death and are available for a partner to use with prior written consent.
The programme is also about addressing a demographic crisis which existed before Russia's invasion but has been made far worse by the large numbers of men dying in action, many of them Ukraine's youngest and fittest.
Then there's the millions, mainly women, who have left as refugees. Four years on, many are still abroad because life in Ukraine isn't getting easier.
That fact is driven home when I meet the MP in a hotel lobby and we talk without removing our coats: this winter Russia's relentless missile strikes on the power grid have left thousands of buildings in Kyiv freezing cold.
""We're also thinking about the future and all the young people we've lost. We need to replace them,"" Dmitrieva says. ""This is one tiny step to improve the demographic situation.""
On her own visits to the frontline the MP encourages soldiers to talk about their sex lives and fertility problems – and to think about freezing their sperm.
""At first they're really embarrassed, but we talk and I tell them to tell others, and then they come and they do it,"" she says.
""If they have this chance, then why not? It doesn't hurt!""
Kyiv's state-run Centre for Reproductive Medicine began accepting soldiers onto the ""frozen sperm"" programme in January.
Only a dozen or so have signed up so far but the clinic is confident that will change once word gets out.
""We expect big demand. We have high hopes,"" director Oksana Holikova says, leading me towards the laboratory where the ""biomaterial"" is collected, prepared, and then stored.
Giant vats open with a puff of what looks like dry ice to reveal long, slim tubes suspended inside, full of sperm.
Our route through quiet corridors reveals the hidden strains of this war: just one newborn gurgling in a cot, and one woman in labour. The number of pregnant patients the clinic sees has dropped by half since the start of the all-out war.
""If women are stressed, they [can] have problems with their periods. It's all linked,"" Holikova points out. ""About 60% of my patients are on anti-depressants, including people with panic attacks because of the missiles and drones.""
Others have what she terms ""delayed life syndrome"": putting major life decisions, including childbirth, on pause.
""Women are scared of getting pregnant if they're going to end up running to bomb shelters.""
So Ukraine needs every newborn child possible.
But the legislation to help military families doesn't always work smoothly.
Katerina Malyshko and her husband Vitaly had been trying for a baby for a while. She believes their problems conceiving naturally were caused, or at least exacerbated, by the war: ""all the stress and sleepless nights,"" Katerina says. ""Every night is like a lottery: you don't know whether you'll wake up.""
The young couple would have celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary this year, perhaps with a new baby. Last winter they had three viable embryos at the fertility clinic and Katerina was due to have them transferred to her womb.
Then Vitaly was killed.
""It was a direct hit with a guided bomb, he had no chance,"" she tells me.
Katerina talks frankly about her struggle just to go on living without her husband. Her pain was then made even more acute when the clinic said she had no right to continue treatment with the frozen embryos or Vitaly's sperm.
""They would store it,"" she says. ""But I couldn't use it.""
The MP, Oksana Dmitrieva, has intervened directly with some clinics to ensure soldiers' families get treated. But she admits the new law still needs ""ironing out"".
A vote on several amendments is due in Spring.
But Katerina, desperate and grieving, had to turn to the courts and it was only six emotionally exhausting months later that a judge finally decided in her favour.
""I read the ruling and sat there and cried. Because it was our family. We had waited to long for that and been through so much,"" Katerina recalls.
""I felt joy and grief at the same time because I'd had to fight for my rights. But I wanted to do it, to honour my husband.""
Katerina isn't ready to try for a child just yet: she feels too fragile.
She also has no hopes the war will end soon, which would allow her to give birth in a country at peace.
""If we compromise now, then what did so many people die for?"" is her reaction to the idea Ukraine might give up land Vitaly was killed defending, for Russia to stop its invasion.
But Katerina does want the option of having her husband's baby when she's ready for that.
""I think the children of our soldiers who've been killed should have a chance to live: they have the right to live in the country their parents died for.""
Out on the frontline, in constant danger, Maxim agrees.
""That's why I did it, and it's great!"" the soldier tells me over the phone. ""Because maybe tomorrow, I'm suddenly gone. But my wife will have my sperm and can use it. It's one less thing for me to worry about.""
The biggest problem Maxim sees is persuading men to sign up for the programme.
The Kyiv clinic director, Oksana Horlikova, recalls talking to one war veteran who told her soldiers were coming to him in tears because they were struggling to have sex with their partners or conceive.
""Men are secretive, but there are lots of psychological problems,"" Maxim admits.
So he suggests soldiers could be told to freeze their sperm when they're drafted, like they leave DNA samples to identify them if they're killed.
""All that's holding people back is that we need to talk about this more and explain why it's important,"" the soldier concludes.
""Because we men won't do anything, unless you shove it in our face – and make us.""

Is VAR any better in the rest of Europe's top leagues?,2026-02-18T07:02:05.063Z,No Author Listed,
Trump's new world order has become real and Europe is having to adjust fast,2026-02-16T05:39:01.728Z," Katya Adler
Europe editor
","Downtown Munich is best-known for chic shops and flashy fast cars but right now its streets are bedecked with posters advertising next generation drones.
""Europe's security under construction"" boasts the slogan on an eye-catching set of sleek black-and-white photographs, festooned across a scaffolding-clad church on one of this town's best known pedestrian boulevards.
Such an unapologetic public display of military muscle would have been unimaginable here just a few years ago, but the world outside Germany is changing fast, and taking this country with it.
The southern region of Bavaria has become Germany's leading defence technology hub, focusing on AI, drones and aerospace.
People here, like most other Europeans, say they feel increasingly exposed - squeezed between an expansionist Russia and an economically aggressive China to the east, and an increasingly unpredictable, former best pal, the United States, to the west.
According to a recent Eurobarometer poll, more than two-thirds of Europeans (68%) feel their country is under threat.
This autumn, Germany's Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance warned for the first time since the Cold War that war is no longer ""unlikely"". While emphasising that this is a safe country, it also recommends that Germans keep food supplies to last three to ten days at home. Just in case.
Germany is the number one single donor of military and other aid to Ukraine, now that the US has halted any new direct aid. Opinion polls suggest voters here want to feel better protected at home too.
The question for this country, along with others in Europe is whether traditional alliances with the US, in Nato and the EU can suffice, or whether they should be diversifying into ad-hoc coalitions alongside other like-minded nations such as Australia, South Korea and Japan?
By 2029, the German defence budget will be higher than the UK and French equivalents combined, Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte pointed out to me.
He described the €150bn they say they will spend on defence as ""a staggering amount"".
It's something the United States notices and appreciates, he said. Donald Trump is far from the first US president to insist that Europe do more for its own security, though his tone has been noticeably more threatening than that of his predecessors.
The precarious state of transatlantic relations was the main focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) this weekend. It's the world's biggest annual defence meeting, bringing leaders, security experts and defence industries together.
While it's easy to dismiss speech-heavy get-togethers like this as wind-baggy talking shops, in the turbulent times we live in, they can make a difference - especially the informal private huddles between global decision makers, far away from the glare of the cameras.
The most eagerly - and for some the most anxiously - anticipated speech at this year's conference was that of the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who represented the Trump administration here.
European leaders and top diplomats were seriously on the edge of their seats. But why was a simple 30-minute address given so much importance?
It's because Europe-US relations have never been so frayed as they are now, over the last 80 years since World War Two. And this isn't a bust-up between buddies that will easily blow over.
In the just over 12 months since Trump returned to the White House, he has at times insulted and undermined European leaders, slapped big tariffs on their exports, and most shockingly of all to his allies in Nato, threatened Danish sovereignty over its territory, Greenland, refusing for a while to rule out taking the island by force.
Speaking at the MSC on Saturday, Denmark's still clearly furious prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Trump's designs on Greenland remained ""the same"" despite ongoing trilateral talks between representatives of Greenland, the US and Denmark.
Trump has ruled out taking Greenland by military force for now, and he's backed away (for the moment, at least) from slapping economic sanctions on allies, including the UK, France and Germany, that were getting in the way of the US acquiring the Arctic island. But transatlantic trust was severely damaged.
European powers see in Trump a truly transactional president who thinks nothing of leveraging security or economic relations with his closest allies to get what he wants. Just before being re-elected president, for example, he told Europeans that the US would not protect nations that didn't pay their way on defence.
It is true though, that Europe has been coasting on America's security blanket for decades. Critics in the US argue that European nations have been able to run generous welfare states for decades while Washington picked up the tab for security spending.
Germany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, told me on Saturday: ""We got used to the strong support from the US; we got used to our comfort zone in which we used to live. This time is over, definitely over,"" he said. ""Washington was right.""
But the crisis over Greenland and other actions by the Trump administration - such as when it temporarily paused intelligence-sharing with Ukrainian forces last March, leaving them blind on the battlefield, in order to pressure Kyiv into engaging in peace talks with Moscow - have left deep scars and a troubling sense of transatlantic wariness.
Hence the trepidation in Munich before Rubio took the stage.
In the end, his words were laced with a sense of historic kinship. ""We want Europe to be strong,"" he said. ""The two great wars of the last century serve for us as a constant reminder that ultimately our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.""
I found it telling that so many leading European figures in the audience jumped on the warmth of his words, rising to their feet to applaud the US Secretary of State. They were clearly relieved he hadn't threatened or berated Europe as the US Vice President JD Vance famously did at last year's MSC.
But for those listening closely, Rubio's speech was loyal to themes close to the heart of the Trump administration and hard for many European leaders to swallow: anti climate action, sceptical of globalisation, multilateralism, migration and pro the building of a new era of Christian western civilisation.
Rubio was clear: the US wasn't interested in allies clinging to the old status quo. It wanted to forge a new path, ideally alongside Europe, but only if it shared the same values.
This US offer of close partnership was conditional and absent of a sense of compromise.
""A bit like a (psychologically) abusive partner,"" said one European diplomat, speaking candidly on condition of anonymity. ""He reminded Europe how wonderful the (transatlantic) relationship used to be, but he then switched to coercion: If you want things to be good between us in the future, you have to do as I say!""
Another diplomat pointed out that, while talking of shared values, it was telling, he said, that of all the European countries that Rubio could have gone to after making his speech in Germany, he chose to visit Slovakia and Hungary before heading back to the US.
They are viewed by Brussels as two of the EU's most problematic members, both with Eurosceptic nationalist prime ministers who oppose sending military aid to Ukraine and who are tough on migration.
Rubio's softer tone also divided European leaders who had recently spoken as one, in defence of Denmark, at the height of the Greenland crisis last month.
The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, underlined a now fragile relationship with the US, despite Rubio's gentler rhetoric. ""Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore,"" she said. ""Europeans have suffered shock therapy.""
But will some countries in Europe grasp what warmness there was in Rubio's speech as an excuse not to rush to boost defence spending as promised? The coffers of most European governments are over stretched already and their voters tend to prioritise cost-of-living concerns over defence budgets.
Rachel Ellehuus, Director-General of defence think-tank RUSI told me she sees a rift opening up across the continent.
On the one hand, you have the Nordic and Baltic nations that are geographically close to Russia, and also Germany and the Netherlands, which are all big defence spenders, she says, whereas in southern Europe, there's Spain, for example, that is absolutely unapologetic about refusing to increase defence budgets to the levels demanded by Donald Trump.
France and Britain are both verbally committed to boosting defence spending, says Ellehuus, but are still looking for a ""political band aid"" to help them explain to voters the trade-offs that will involve - higher taxes, less welfare or more borrowing.
""Europeans need to get to work yesterday and to focus,"" she says. ""They have 5-10 years to stand on their own two feet in terms of conventional defence capabilities.""
Last week, U.S. Undersecretary of Defence Elbridge Colby couldn't have been more stark in his messaging at a meeting of Nato defence ministers he attended in Brussels: Europe was no longer a US priority, the Indo-Pacific was.
""Under President Trump's leadership, we are reprioritising the defence of our homeland and the protection of our interests in our Hemisphere,"" he said.
While he emphasised that the US remained committed to Nato's mutual defence clause, where an attack against one member is viewed as an attack against all, Colby insisted the US would be reducing its capabilities in Europe, becoming ""a more limited and focused"" presence.
Europe had to become a partner, rather than a dependent, he said, calling for a new ""Nato 3.0"". The old world order with the West at its core, has faded but the MSC this weekend made clear that what comes next for Europe and the US is still very much up in the air.
Marco Rubio called for a new century of western civilisation, Elbridge Colby wants a re-vamped Nato, while the UK's prime minister appealed in Munich for the western alliance to be re-made.
In stark contrast to Marco Rubio's insistence on greater national sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer spoke in favour of greater integration between the UK and Europe on defence - to cut re-armament costs, though, he emphasised this did not mean the UK turning its back on the United States.
Sophia Gaston, national security expert at Kings College London, told me that in Munich, Starmer was able to better articulate the nuance of Britain's strategic outlook.
""Other allies in Europe may be more willing to speak of divergence from Washington"", she says, ""but for Britain it remains a strategic imperative to triangulate within the Transatlantic relationship. There will also be times when Britain will have to make hard choices, and Starmer appeared more confident in confronting that reality.
""The key is to have a really strong grasp of the national interest and our instruments of power and influence. This requires a much more competitive approach that has not always felt natural to Britain, which has typically pursued much of its diplomacy in elegant, consensus-focused and invisible ways.""
In these fast-moving, unpredictable times, Europe's leaders are increasingly turning to a la carte coalitions, alongside traditional organisations like Nato or the EU, which are larger and therefore often slower to react. These groupings also include non-European nations.
Take, for example, the so-called Coalition of the Willing group of countries, led by the UK and France and formed to secure Ukrainian sovereignty in the case of an eventual peace deal with Russia. Turkey has attended coalition meetings, as have New Zealand and Australia.
Canada is increasingly working alongside Nordic and Baltic nations that share geopolitical challenges and common values, they say, and want to promote stability and deterrence from the edges of the Baltic Sea, through the Nordic and Baltic states, through the North Atlantic, Greenland and across the Canadian arctic.
One European policy-maker who asked not to be named joked to me that Canada was becoming ""more and more European by the day"". Japan and South Korea were increasingly seen as part of the ""like-minded family"" too, he said.
These ad hoc coalitions are not restricted to defence alone. France's President Macron has long called for Europe to increase what he calls its strategic autonomy, in traditional security terms but also energy security, supply chains and new technologies. In Munich he recommended Europe ""de-risk"" from all outside powers.
This weekend even saw the president of the European Commission admitting that if the EU failed to move fast enough on improving competitiveness, ""a group of its member states would have to move forward alone"".
Attempts by smaller pockets of European powers to work together to advance European strategic independence are by no means always successful. Take the current row between France and Germany over their joint attempt to come up with the next generation of fighter jet with the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).
You could also say that for all the talk of building European independence, this weekend's conference was also a reminder of just how dependent Europe remains on US security support - from its nuclear umbrella to intelligence sharing and command and control structures. It was also a reminder of how far Europe trails the US in high tech innovation.
But more than short-term mechanisms designed to 'survive' Donald Trump, the changes we are witnessing in Europe, including closer alliances outside the continent, are liable to be longer lasting. The world now seems to dance to the tune of big power politics. And even slow-moving Europe is having to adapt.

Austrian climber found guilty after girlfriend froze to death on mountain,2026-02-20T01:10:28.568Z," Bethany Bell
BBC Vienna correspondent
","An Austrian climber has been found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter after his girlfriend froze to death on Austria's highest mountain last year.
The man, named only as Thomas P in line with Austrian privacy laws, has been given a five-month suspended sentence and fined €9,600 (£8,400).
His girlfriend, Kerstin G, died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025.
In a statement sent to the BBC, the court said it considered Thomas P's previous clean record and the loss of a person close to him ""to be mitigating factors"".
It said it also took into account ""the public discussion on social media, which was incriminating for the defendant"".
The judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced climber who works with mountain and helicopter rescue teams in Tyrol, said Thomas P was an excellent Alpinist, but that his girlfriend was light-years behind him in terms of her climbing abilities.
He said the couple should have turned back as Kerstin G did not have enough experience in winter conditions.
The court also heard from Andrea B, a former girlfriend of Thomas P, who described how he had left her alone on a previous tour on the Grossglockner in 2023.
She said she had been at the end of her tether, feeling dizzy and her headlight had gone out.
She said she was crying and screaming when he suddenly disappeared, walking ahead and leaving her behind.
According to reports in the Austrian media, the court heard how the mountain rescue team found Kerstin's body hanging upside down from a rock face.
""We were amazed that she remained in that position,"" one of the rescuers told the court. If the wind had been any stronger, ""she would have fallen over the south face"".
The prosecution said there were strong winds of up to 74 km/h (45 mph), and was very cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20C, they said.
They argued that as the more experienced climber, Thomas P was ""the responsible guide for the tour"".
They said he failed to turn back or call for help in time to help his girlfriend.
Thomas P should never have allowed himself to get into this situation, the prosecutor said.
Thomas P pleaded not guilty. He told the court he was deeply sorry. He said he had loved his girlfriend, who was very sporty and that they had planned the trip together.
His lawyer Kurt Jelinek said the couple had found themselves in a really difficult and stressful situation.
He said Kerstin was not inexperienced and knew what she was getting into.
Prosecutors say the couple got stuck on the mountain and that the man failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:30.
Video footage from the helicopter showed the couple still climbing. The judge noted that no distress signals were sent.
The defence argued that at that point Thomas P and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.
Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.
But shortly afterwards, the defence said the situation changed dramatically, when Kerstin became exhausted close to the summit.
The defence said that she told Thomas P to go to get help.
At 00:35 on 19 January, he called the mountain police. The content of the conversation is disputed. Rescuers said it wasn't an emergency call but the lawyer says he denies telling police that everything was fine.
He scaled the summit and descended on the other side, leaving Kerstin behind. Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00 am.
Webcam images show his torchlit figure coming down from the summit.
The trial sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders, raising questions about when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability.
The case is subject to appeal.

Man jailed for causing unlawful termination of pregnancy,2026-02-19T17:26:18.705Z,No Author Listed,"A man who caused the termination of a woman's pregnancy by forcing her to take abortion pills before locking her in a room, has been jailed for nine years in the Republic of Ireland.
Adeleke Adelani, who is currently serving a seven year sentence for a separate offence, had previously admitted unlawfully ending the life of a foetus on 14 February 2020 in Letterkenny, County Donegal.
At Letterkenny Circuit Court on Thursday, judge John Alymer said Adelani had carried out an act an extreme act of physical and emotional violence.
He sentenced Adelani to 11 years in prison, the final two years of which are suspended, for causing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy.
Warning: This article contains details that some readers may find distressing
Adelani was also sentenced to five years, with the final 12 months suspended, for assault causing harm.
The sentences are to run concurrently.
Adelani had been due to stand trial in November 2025 but pleaded guilty before a jury was selected.
In a victim impact statement, which the woman had read to the court during proceedings, she said: ""I have forgiven the defendant. The forgiveness does not mean what he did was acceptable. It means I refuse to let what he did continue to control my heart and my life.""
She added: ""When he wrongfully imprisoned me and caused the termination of my nine-week pregnancy, he took far more than my freedom.
""He took my child. He took my sense of safety. He took a future that I had already begun to plan and love.""
The court was told the woman had become pregnant by Adelani in 2019 but they both decided to terminate the pregnancy.
She became pregnant again in 2020 and had decided to keep the baby, the court was told.
Adelani had invited the woman to his home in Donegal on Valentine's Day 2020, the court heard, under the belief that he too wanted to keep the baby.
The court heard that after they spoke face-to-face, he forced her to take tablets normally prescribed by medical professionals in a controlled environment.
The court was told Adelani told her that he would beat her nine-week-old foetus out of her if she did not take the abortion tablets.
After forcing her to swallow the tablets, Adelani left to buy a pregnancy test, the court heard.
The woman, who Adelani had met on Snapchat, then phoned gardaí (Irish police) and officers arrived at the house at 14:20 on 14 February 2020.
Adelani was arrested at the scene and his phone was seized. It remained locked for four years, as he would not provide the pin.
Officers accessed the phone before he was due to stand trial last year, the court heard.
A conversation between Adelani and the woman, recorded on his phone, when he told her she had to have an abortion was played to the courtroom.
The court was told Adelani forced the woman to take five misoprostol 200mg tablets, told her how to swallow them and then locked her in a bedroom.
The woman became unwell after she was forced to take the tablets. She came down with a fever, she was shivering and she also had cramps, the court was told.
She was in great pain and was passing clots of blood.
During police interviews, Adelani, did not make any admissions, was non-compliant and did not look at the woman as a girlfriend, the court heard.
In a letter to his victim, read in court, Adelani said he now takes full responsibility for his actions and was ""heavily apologising"" for the pain he caused.
Judge Aylmer said the offence of unlawfully ending the pregnancy of the victim was ""extremely premediated"" and had involved a ""great deal of internet research"".
""You were fully aware of her expressed desire to keep her baby and completely aware of the potential appalling emotional consequences of terminating the pregnancy without her consent.
Following sentencing Det Insp Paul McGee praised the ""unwavering strength and resolve"" of the victim.

Climber on trial for leaving girlfriend to die on Austria's highest mountain,2026-02-18T07:58:02.750Z," Bethany Bell
Vienna correspondent
","More than a year after a 33-year-old woman froze to death on Austria's highest mountain, her boyfriend goes on trial on Thursday accused of gross negligent manslaughter.
Kerstin G died of hypothermia on a mountain climbing trip to the Grossglockner that went horribly wrong. Her boyfriend is accused of leaving her unprotected and exhausted close to the summit in stormy conditions in the early hours of 19 January 2025, while he went to get help.
The trial has sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders.
Prosecutors say that, as the more experienced climber, the man on trial was ""the responsible guide for the tour"" and failed to turn back or call for support in time to help his girlfriend.
Identified by Austrian media as Thomas P, he denies the charges and his lawyer, Kurt Jelinek, has described the woman's death as ""a tragic accident.""
The tragedy unfolded after the couple began their climb of the 3,798m (12,460ft) Grossglockner.
Prosecutors accuse Thomas P of making mistakes from the outset and have published a list of nine errors.
At stake is the question of when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability. If the climber is found guilty it could mean ""a paradigm shift for mountain sports"", says Austria's Der Standard newspaper.
Key to the case is the charge by state prosecutors in Innsbruck that he was to be considered the ""responsible guide for the tour"", as ""unlike his girlfriend [he was] already very experienced in high-altitude Alpine tours and had planned the tour"".
They said he attempted the trip even though his girlfriend had ""never undertaken an Alpine tour of this length, difficulty, and altitude, and despite the challenging winter conditions"".
They also allege he started out two hours too late and had failed to take ""enough emergency bivouac equipment"".
He also ""allowed his girlfriend to use... snowboard soft boots, equipment that is not suitable for a high-altitude tour in mixed terrain"", say prosecutors.
The defendant disputes this. In a statement, his lawyer Kurt Jelinek, said the couple had planned the tour together.
""Both considered themselves... to be sufficiently experienced, adequately prepared, and well equipped,"" he said. Both had ""relevant Alpine experience"" and were ""in very good physical condition"".
Once on the mountain, prosecutors say the man should have turned back, when it was still possible, because of strong winds of up to 74km/h (45mph), and the winter cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20, they said.
The couple did not turn back.
Accounts of what happened next differ.
According to the defendant's lawyer, they reached a place called Frühstücksplatz at 13:30 on 18 January, the point of the tour after which there was no turning back before the summit.
As neither of them was ""exhausted or overwhelmed, they continued on"", Kurt Jelinek said.
Prosecutors say the couple got stuck at about 20:50 and that the man failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:50.
The boyfriend's lawyer said at that point his client and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.
Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.
But shortly afterwards, Mr Jelinek said the situation changed dramatically. To the man's ""complete surprise"", the woman ""suddenly showed increased signs of exhaustion"", although by then turning back was too late.
At 00:35 on 19 January, he called mountain police. The content of the conversation is unclear but the lawyer says he asked for help and denies telling police that everything was fine. Police allege he then put his phone on silent and did not take any more calls.
Kurt Jelinek says the couple managed to reach an area about 40m (130ft) below the cross marking the summit of the Grossglockner.
As the defendant's girlfriend was too exhausted to move, he left her to find help, scaling the summit and descending on the other side, he says. Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00am.
His torchlit figure is captured on webcam images as he descended from the summit.
Prosecutors say he did not use aluminium rescue blankets or other gear to protect her from the cold and waited until 03:30 before notifying emergency services.
By that point it was most probably too late. The strong winds meant that no helicopter rescue could take place during the night.
Kerstin G died alone in the snow on the frozen mountainside.
Her social media feed suggests she was a keen mountaineer and her mother has told German media that she loved mountain hiking at night.
Thomas P's lawyer says he is ""deeply sorry"" for her death. ""Above all, he would like to express his sincere condolences to the family of the deceased,"" Mr Jelinek said.
If found guilty, Thomas P faces up to three years in prison.
And a guilty verdict could also have implications for other mountain climbers, and how much they could be liable for their companions in the future.

US says 'meaningful progress' made as Ukraine talks enter second day,2026-02-18T07:37:24.724Z," Chris Graham
BBC News
","US special envoy Steve Witkoff said talks between Ukraine and Russia had ""brought about meaningful progress"" to end the war, as both sides prepared for a second day of negotiations in Geneva on Wednesday.
However, hopes of a breakthrough remain low, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying it ""was not fair"" that US President Donald Trump keeps asking his country to compromise, adding that ""peace wouldn't be achieved if victory is handed to Russia"".
US President Donald Trump has recently suggested it is up to Ukraine to ensure talks in Switzerland are successful, without mentioning Russia.
The Kremlin has not wavered from its maximalist demands for Ukrainian territory.
""President Trump's success in bringing both sides of this war together has brought about meaningful progress, and we are proud to work under his leadership to stop the killing in this terrible conflict,"" Witkoff wrote on X after the first day of talks.
Zelensky has repeatedly said his country is being asked to make disproportionate compromises compared to Russia.
Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including large parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over the rest of the region, which Ukraine has ruled out.
Ukraine says robust security guarantees from the West - including the US - must come before any settlement with Russia can be agreed.
Zelensky told the Axios website on Tuesday it was ""not fair"" that Trump kept calling on Ukraine to broker a deal, adding: ""I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision.""
In a statement on social media on Tuesday evening, top Ukrainian negotiator Umerov said the first day of talks focused on ""practical issues and the mechanics of possible solutions"".
In a video address shortly afterwards, Zelensky said Ukraine was ready to refrain from carrying out strikes, as proposed by the US to both Kyiv and Moscow.
""We don't need war,"" he said, stressing that Ukrainians were ""defending our state, our independence"".
""We are also ready to quickly move towards a worthy agreement to end the war. The question is only for the Russians: What do they want?""
The talks are the third round of trilateral negotiations.
Russia's state news agency RIA quoted a source saying that Tuesday's negotiations, which lasted six hours, had been tense and took place in different bilateral and trilateral formats.
The talks are being mediated by Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the US president's son-in-law.
On the Russian side, President Vladimir Putin's aide Vladimir Medinsky is the top negotiator.
The negotiations are being held a week before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian defence ministry said 43 Ukrainian drones were shot down over several Russian regions and Crimea overnight into Wednesday.
Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 126 attack drones at Ukraine overnight, adding preliminary data suggested 100 had been shot down before they reached their target.

Nine arrested in France over death of far-right student,2026-02-17T21:08:32.667Z," Hugh Schofield
Paris
","Nine people have been arrested in France following an investigation into the murder of a far-right nationalist student by suspected militants from the far-left.
Those detained include a parliamentary assistant for a deputy from the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) party.
Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old maths student, died in hospital on Saturday - two days after being beaten and kicked about the head by a gang of masked young men in Lyon.
It happened after a small demonstration by far-right feminists - who Deranque was supposed to be helping protect - at the city's Institute of Political Studies (IEP), commonly known as Sciences-Po.
The arrests confirm what has widely been reported: that those suspected of the murder are far-left militants linked to a banned group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard).
The most striking news is that among the nine in custody is Jacques-Elie Favrot, a young man who until now has been employed as parliamentary assistant at the National Assembly in Paris for a deputy from LFI.
The murder is putting huge pressure on LFI, on its 70 MPs, and on its veteran leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is a likely contender in next year's presidential election.
On Sunday, Mélenchon said his party had ""nothing to do with this story. Those who accuse us are committing a libel.
""We express our consternation, but also our empathy and compassion for [Deranque's] family and friends. We have said dozens of times that we oppose all forms of violence,"" he said.
On Monday, state prosecutor Thierry Dran told a news conference that Deranque was kicked and punched by ""at least six"" individuals, and that the post-mortem examination showed fatal damage to his skull and brain.

Shein under EU investigation over childlike sex dolls,2026-02-17T19:08:57.942Z," Dearbail Jordan
Business reporter
","The European Union (EU) has launched a formal investigation into fast fashion giant Shein over possible breaches of digital law, including the sale of childlike sex dolls.
The European Commission (EC), the EU's executive arm, said it will examine what systems the Chinese firm has in place to prevent the sale of illegal products ""including content which could constitute child sexual abuse material"".
It will also investigate the ""addictive design"" of Shein's platform and the transparency of the system it uses to suggest products and content to shoppers.
Shein said: ""Protecting minors and reducing the risk of harmful content and behaviours are central to how we develop and operate our platform.""
Last year, Shein was reported to French authorities for selling ""sex dolls with a childlike appearance"" on its website.
The firm said it removed the products immediately, banned the sellers, and removed the sale of sex dolls ""regardless of appearance"" across its global site. It also said it worked with local and international authorities on investigations into both the buyers and sellers of the childlike sex dolls.
The Commission said it will investigate the systems Shein uses to limit the sale of illegal products. It said that would include weapons but declined to specify particular items.
It has sent a number of requests for information to Shein in the past and EC spokesperson Thomas Regnier told the BBC's World Business Report that Shein was ""very cooperative"".
But the EC said that once there were indications that a platform may have systemic risks for its users, the EC could open proceedings to investigate further.
Regnier said the EC was concerned about the ""addictive"" nature of Shein's website, and the ""gamification"" of the platform, including its ""rewards programme"" for consumers.
He said that the Commission was not against reward programmes per se, but that online platform algorithms were ""often opaque"".
""You don't know how they're being designed [and] you're not in control of what you see,"" he said.
The EC will also examine the transparency of so-called ""recommender systems"" which use a shopper's data to push certain products their way.
It said that under the Digital Services Act (DSA), Shein must disclosed the main parameters it uses to recommend products and must provide users with ""at least one easily accessible option"" that is not based on using their data to profile their likely purchases.
Opening a formal investigation into a company means that the EC can take ""enforcement steps"" such as fines of up to 6% of a company's global sales. In the most recent figures available, Shein reported $38bn in sales for 2024.
A spokesperson for Shein said: ""Over the last few months, we have continued to invest significantly in measures to strengthen our compliance with the DSA.
""These include comprehensive systemic-risk assessments and mitigation frameworks, enhanced protections for younger users, and ongoing work to design our services in ways that promote a safe and trusted user experience,"" it said.

France releases suspected Russian 'shadow fleet' tanker after fine paid,2026-02-17T14:20:33.037Z," Jessica Rawnsley
","France says it has released an oil tanker suspected of being part of Russia's sanctions-busting ""shadow fleet"" after its owner paid a fine.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the vessel, Grinch, was ""leaving French waters"" on Tuesday having paid a penalty of ""several million euros"".
The tanker was seized by French forces in the Mediterranean in January and then diverted to the port city of Marseille. It had set sail from Murmansk in northern Russia and was flying under a Comoros flag, officials said.
Moscow's so-called shadow fleet is a clandestine network of tankers used to evade Western sanctions on Russian oil exports by using aged tankers with obscure ownership or insurance.
Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian oil after it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
""Circumventing European sanctions comes at a price. Russia will no longer be able to finance its war with impunity through a ghost fleet off our coasts,"" Barrot said in a post on X.
He added: ""The tanker Grinch will leave French waters after shelling out several million euros and three weeks of costly immobilisation at Fos-sur-Mer. Let's keep it up.""
""As part of a guilty plea procedure the company that owns the vessel was sentenced by the Marseille judicial court to a financial penalty of confiscation,"" the public prosecutor's office and regional maritime authorities said in a statement.
The exact amount the vessel's owner was fined was unclear.
Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common. A growing number of tankers transporting Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil are using a variety of methods to conceal their identities and contravene Western sanctions.
While estimates vary, data from the monitoring group TankerTrackers.com suggests the fleet currently consists of 1,468 vessels, roughly triple its size at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago.
The vessels tend to be old and are often poorly maintained. Details of ownership and management are deliberately opaque - names, identification numbers and flags are frequently changed.
Efforts have been stepped up to tackle shadow fleets in recent months and a number of sanctioned tankers have been seized.
In January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia.
Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.

Deportation of Irish man in ICE custody temporarily halted,2026-02-17T13:28:04.243Z," Gabija Gataveckaite
BBC News NI Dublin correspondent
","The deportation of an Irish man who is being held in an US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in El Paso, Texas, has been temporarily halted.
Seamus Culleton, who is originally from Glenmore, County Kilkenny, was detained by ICE in September 2025 while he was in the process of applying for his green card.
Lawyers for Culleton, the BOS Legal Group in Boston, Massachusetts, said a court has issued a temporary order pausing his deportation for 10 business days.
The US Department Of Homeland Security has previously told BBC News NI that ""a pending green card application and work authorisation does not give someone legal status"" to remain in the US.
Culleton entered the United States in 2009 under the visa waiver program, which allows people to stay in the US for 90 days without needing a visa.
He is married to a US citizen and owns a plastering business in the Boston area.
He has lived in the US for almost 18 years.
""Culleton has resided in the United States for nearly two decades and is married to a US citizen,"" a BOS Legal Group spokesperson said.
""He has no criminal entries since living in the United States.""
The spokesperson added that he ""presents no public safety concerns, and has strong familial and community ties in the United States"".
""Our legal team remains focused on securing his release from ICE custody and obtaining the immigration relief necessary for him to be reunited with his wife and to remain in the United States with his family,"" the legal group said.
While he had previously been undocumented in the US, Culleton's lawyer said last week that he was in the final stages of receiving his green card and had a valid work permit.
He was arrested on 9 September 2025, and has since been held at a number of ICE detention facilities, most recently in El Paso, Texas.
The detention facility is almost 4,000km from his home in Boston.
Speaking to RTÉ's Liveline from the detention centre, Culleton said he had been locked in the same room with 71 other detainees in what he described as squalid conditions and with insufficient food and negligible time outside for fresh air, sunshine or exercise.
""You don't know what's going to happen on a day-to-day basis.
""You don't know if there's going to be riots, you don't know what's going to happen. It's a nightmare down here.""
In a statement issued to BBC News NI last week, Department Of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: ""On September 9, 2025, ICE arrested Seamus Culleton, an illegal alien from Ireland.""
She added: ""He entered the United States in 2009 under the visa waiver program, which allows you to stay in the US for 90 days without a visa. He failed to depart the US. He received full due process and was issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge on September 10, 2025.""
She said Culleton was offered the chance to be removed to Ireland but he ""chose to stay in ICE custody, in fact he took affirmative steps to remain in detention"".
""A pending green card application and work authorisation does not give someone legal status to be in our country. Being in detention is a choice,"" she added.
McLaughlin added: ""The United States is offering illegal aliens $2,600 and a free flight to self-deport now. We encourage every person here illegally to take advantage of this offer and reserve the chance to come back to the US the right legal way to live the American dream.
""If not, you will be arrested and deported without a chance to return.""

Five young people die in Spain apartment block fire,2026-02-17T10:06:36.358Z," Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor
","Five young people have died in a fire that broke out in a storage space in a residential block of flats in north-east Spain.
Residents raised the alarm about the fire in a five-storey building in the small town of Manlleu, about 80km (50 miles) north of Barcelona, shortly after 21:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Monday, Catalonia's fire brigade said. Four other people were slightly hurt in the blaze.
The identities of those who died is not yet known but reports said they include children and none of them lived in the building.
It is not clear why they could not escape the storage room, which is on the upper floor, according to firefighters. An investigation is under way into the fire's cause.
The grandfather of one of the young victims told La Vanguardia that the boys used the storage room, which is thought to have been converted into a living space, to meet each other.
No official details have been confirmed about the victims but witnesses told local media that they were aged between 14 and 18.
The local authority said it was providing support to the victims and it declared three days of mourning.
Catalan President Salvador Illa Roca said he was shocked by the deaths and expressed his deepest condolences to families and friends.

Search for Irish women missing since 1990s ends for the night,2026-02-16T22:17:33.137Z,No Author Listed,"A search taking place in the Republic of Ireland as part of the investigation into the disappearance and murders of Josephine ""Jo Jo"" Dullard and Deirdre Jacob in the 1990s has ended for the night.
Gardaí (Irish police) will resume the search on Tuesday, where the force is searching open ground at a location near the border between Wicklow and Kildare.
They added that the area of land would be ""searched and subject to excavation, technical and forensic examinations over the coming days"".
Dullard went missing in 1995, while Jacob disappeared in 1998.
Gardaí said they ""continue to keep an open mind into these investigations"".
Dullard, 21, went missing from Moone in County Kildare on 9 November 1995, after earlier socialising in Dublin.
The case was upgraded from a missing persons to a murder inquiry in 2020.
Jacob disappeared on 28 July 1998, aged 18.
She was last seen crossing the road towards the entrance to her home at Roseberry, Newbridge, County Kildare.
The investigation into her disappearance was upgraded to a murder inquiry in 2018.
Gardaí said the search operation ""has the support of other state expertise, if required"" and they continue to keep the families of the two women updated.
They have appealed to ""anyone with any information, no matter how small or insignificant"" to contact them.
The operation is being led by the organisation's Serious Crime Review Team, the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation supported by the Garda National Technical Bureau and local resources from the Kildare Division.

Austrian man faces terror charges over Taylor Swift concert attack plot,2026-02-16T16:56:27.963Z," Jaroslav Lukiv
","An Austrian man has been charged with terrorism and other offences over a plot to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in August 2024.
Prosecutors said the 21-year-old suspect, identified only as Beran A, was accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation, making explosives and attempting to purchase weapons illegally.
He is also said to have been disseminating propaganda for the jihadist group Islamic State. He faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted.
The suspect was arrested after a tip-off from the CIA before Swift's concert. Three sold-out gigs by the US star singer at Vienna's Ernst Happel Stadium were called off. More than 195,000 people had been expected to attend.
Last year, a 16-year-old Syrian national, identified as Mohamed A, was given an 18-month suspended sentence by a court in Germany over the attack. He avoided prison under juvenile criminal law.
Overall, three people - including Beran A - were arrested in 2024. They were all teenagers at the time.
The charges against Beran A, who is the main suspect in the case, were announced on Monday by the Vienna prosecutor's office.
According to the indictment, he had received online instructions and worked to make a shrapnel bomb using the explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP).
The type of shrapnel bomb was ""specific to IS attacks"", the statement said.
He is also believed to have sought advice from IS members on how to carry out a bomb attack.
Beran A has not commented on the latest developments.
The US foreign intelligence service said back in 2024 that the plotters had hoped to kill a large number of concert-goers.
Investigators alleged Beran A had also planned to carry out an earlier attack in Dubai in March 2024.
Reports at the time suggested it was part of a co-ordinated plot involving three simultaneous IS attacks but he had changed his mind at the last minute.
In a post on social media two years ago, Swift described the cancellation of her Vienna tour dates as ""devastating"".
""But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives,"" she added.

French police conduct searches over ex-minister Jack Lang's links to Epstein,2026-02-16T16:39:00.174Z," Hugh Schofield
Paris
","French police have been conducting searches at Paris' prestigious Arab World Institute (IMA) as part of an investigation into links between its former president Jack Lang and the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Lang, an 86-year-old former Socialist minister, resigned from his IMA post just over a week ago after his name was found nearly 700 times in the latest release of Epstein's personal files in the US.
Lang is being investigated in France for suspected ""laundering of the proceeds of tax evasion"". He denies any wrongdoing, describing the allegations as ""baseless"".
On Monday, he told IMA staff the investigation would clear his name. ""I am totally serene because I have nothing to hide.""
Inaugurated in 1987, the IMA is an important cultural centre dedicated to the Arab world, situated on the river Seine and mainly financed by the French foreign ministry.
On 6 February, the financial division of the prosecutor's office opened a preliminary enquiry into Lang and his 64 year-old daughter Caroline Lang.
A preliminary enquiry is conducted on the basis of unverified information and does not necessarily lead to criminal charges.
According to media reports, investigators want to know about an offshore company set up jointly by Epstein and his daughter in the US Virgin Islands, ostensibly with the aim of purchasing art works.
The company was not declared to the French tax authorities, but Caroline Lang says she received no money from it.
Caroline Lang - who once worked for UK media tycoon Robert Maxwell, father of Epstein's imprisoned associate Ghislaine Maxell - is reported in French media to be a named beneficiary of Epstein's will.
She told the French public broadcaster France 2 this week that she had never heard of the will and had never seen any such document or received any funds.
The BBC contacted representatives of both Jack and Caroline Lang.
Epstein is also alleged to have paid $50,000 (£36,670) for a film to be made about Jack Lang's political career.
Lang was a loyal follower of the late Socialist President François Mitterrand, and became famous as culture minister for creating France's annual Fête de la Musique (Festival of Music).
French investigators are also looking into other names mentioned in the Epstein papers, notably modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel who took his own life in a Paris prison in 2022 after being accused of procuring girls for Epstein.

Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old maths student and nationalist activist, died on Saturday, two days after being beaten up on the street by a group of young men.
State prosecutor Thierry Dran told a news conference on Monday afternoon in Lyon that a murder investigation has been opened into the death.
He said that Deranque was kicked and punched by ""at least six"" individuals, and that the autopsy showed fatal damage to his skull and brain.
On Thursday afternoon Deranque had given support to a hard-right feminist collective Némésis, which staged a small protest against a left-wing politician's visit to Lyon's Institute of Political Studies (IEP), commonly known as Sciences-Po.
Mobile phone video footage taken a few streets away from the protest's location showed three young men being kicked and punched by a larger group. One person - believed to be Quentin - remained lying on the ground.
According to Dran, there was an initial confrontation between two groups. A short time later Deranque was one of three nationalist activists who, having failed to get away, were cornered by the opposing group.
Ministers from President Macron's centre-right government blamed ""far-left"" militants for the killing.
Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said: ""Manifestly it was the far-left that was at work … This was a mob-killing, with blows that the perpetrators probably did not intend to be fatal.""
According to Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, ""it is the far-left that killed him. Of that there is no question.""
Dran said investigations were continuing to identify the suspects but no arrests had yet been made.
In a tense political atmosphere ahead of important municipal elections next month, all eyes on Monday were on the radical left party France Unbowed (LFI) and a banned security outfit La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) that in the past helped provide protection at its rallies.
Members from the Némésis collective – whose demonstration Thursday was against a meeting given by LFI euro-deputy Rima Hassan - said they recognised activists from La Jeune Garde in the group that initially disrupted their protest. The group has denied involvement.
Two of the seven Némésis protesters were attacked and hurt in that first confrontation, Dran said.
Hassan on Friday condemned the incident and called for an investigation. In a post on X, she said LFI provided the only security protection for her during the visit and that they were ""in no way"" involved in the violence.
The Deranque family's lawyer, Fabrice Rajon, said Deranque ""was not a security agent or the member of any kind of protection group.
""He had never been involved in trouble … He defended his convictions in a non-violent way.""
Friends told French media that Deranque had rediscovered his Catholic faith in recent years and was active in nationalist politics.
Alice Cordier, of Némésis, said Deranque was one of ""15 or so young boys"" who the collective asked to provide protection at their demonstration.
""It wasn't a professional security service, just friends who came to protect the girls.""
Dran told the news conference that after the beating Deranque was able to start walking home with one of his friends. But en route it became clear that he was in a deteriorating medical state, and the emergency services were called.
Right-wing politicians were outspoken in their denunciation of LFI, saying it had a clear responsibility for encouraging violence by so-called ""antifa"" - anti-fascist militants.
Euro-deputy Marion Maréchal - niece of National Rally leader Marine Le Pen - said: ""The militia of [LFI leader Jean-Luc] Mélenchon has killed and has blood on its hands.""
According to Laurent Wauquiez, parliamentary leader of the centre-right Republicans: ""Quentin fell beneath the blows of monsters guided by hate and blinded by violence.""
Bruno Retailleau, who last week declared himself a candidate for the Republicans in next year's presidential elections, said: ""Jean-Luc Mélenchon … contrary to what you claim, it is not the police that kills in France, it is the far-left.""
On Sunday Mélenchon said his party had ""nothing to do with this story. Those who accuse us are committing a libel.
""We express our consternation, but also our empathy and compassion for [Deranque's] family and friends. We have said dozens of times that we oppose all forms of violence.""

Italy's 'Lovers’ Arch' collapses into sea on Valentine's Day,2026-02-16T15:41:36.025Z," Kerena Cobbina
","A famous rock structure in Italy dubbed ""Lovers' Arch"" collapsed on Valentine's Day after days of heavy rain and strong winds.
The rock formation at Sant'Andrea in Melendugno, Puglia served as a tourist attraction for wedding proposals and was a popular landmark on the Adriatic coast.
""This is an unwanted Valentine's Day gift"", Melendugno Mayor Maurizio Cisternino told local media.
He said it was ""a very hard blow"" for the region and for tourism.
""Nature as it created the bow, has taken it back"", he added.
Passers-by first noticed the absence of the natural landmark on Sunday morning.
Officials have suggested severe weather brought by a storm named Oriana - which has battered southern Italy in recent days - accelerated the rock's erosion, causing its collapse.
""We have lost one of our region's defining characteristics, a symbolic asset,"" Puglia's regional president Antonio Decaro told reporters at the site on Monday.
""Unfortunately, natural processes are often accelerated by meteorological phenomena, such as the tail end of storm Oriana"", he said.
Decaro said authorities needed to concentrate on attempting to slow coastal erosion and preserving the coast.
The Salento region, where the arch was located, is one of Italy's most popular tourist areas.

Five injured as Swiss train derails in heavy snow,2026-02-16T14:17:20.487Z," George Wright
","Five people have been injured after a train derailed in southern Switzerland, in an incident that could have been caused by an avalanche, police say.
The derailment happened near the village of Goppenstein - which is under an avalanche warning - around 07:00 local time (06:00 GMT), officials said.
All 29 passengers have been rescued, while one of the injured was sent to hospital, police said.
Switzerland has experienced heavy rain and snow in recent days, and the country's Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research says the avalanche risk is very high across the alps.
""According to initial findings, an avalanche may have crossed the tracks shortly before the train passed,"" police stated, adding that the public prosecutor's office has opened an investigation.
""Five people were injured. One of them was taken to hospital,"" police added.
The regional commuter train was on its way from Spiez to Brig when it derailed.
Goppenstein, a key hub for road and rail transport, sits at the exit of the Lotschberg rail tunnel. The train derailed as it was exiting the tunnel, police said.
The region is under its second highest avalanche warning - level four of five.
Heavy snow also resulted in 50 people being evacuated from the village of Orsieres, near the French border.
Skiers have been warned by authorities to stay on the marked slopes, and those walking in the mountains should also check avalanche bulletins before setting off.
Last month, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing in the Swiss alps.

Navalny's mother says she always knew he was murdered after poison finding,2026-02-16T13:01:28.058Z," Laura Gozzi
","The mother of the late Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny says the assessment that her son died of poisoning has validated her belief that he was murdered.
On Saturday, the UK and European allies put out a statement saying Navalny, who died in 2024, was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin, and that ""only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin"".
""This confirms what we knew from the very beginning,"" Lyudmila Navalnaya said while visiting her son's grave in Moscow on Monday - the second anniversary of his death. ""We knew that our son did not simply die in prison, he was murdered.""
Russia has firmly rejected the accusations.
""Of course, we do not accept such accusations. We disagree with them, we consider them biased and unfounded. And, in fact, we resolutely reject them,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.
Navalny's widow Yulia has also marked the two-year anniversary of his death, writing in a social media post: ""We have achieved truth and we will achieve justice one day too.""
She previously said that analysis of smuggled biological samples carried out by laboratories in two countries showed that her husband had been ""murdered"", and challenged the facilities to publish their results.
The Kremlin did not comment on her statements at the time.
Dozens of Muscovites, as well as several foreign diplomats, visited Borisovskoye cemetery on Monday, heaping flowers on Navalny's grave.
A note left on the grave read: ""Alexei, we remember you every day"".
Navalny was 47 when he died in the Siberian penal colony where he was serving a 19-year sentence for ""extremism"".
A fierce and charismatic critic of President Vladimir Putin, he mounted campaigns highlighting high-level corruption in government, bringing hundreds of thousands onto the streets and becoming known abroad as Russia's only opposition leader.
He survived a suspected poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent in 2020, for which he received treatment in a German hospital. He returned to Russia the following year, saying he did not want to ""give up either my country or my beliefs"".
Police arrested him on arrival. Just over three years later, he died in the Polar Wolf penal colony above the Arctic Circle.
At the time, the Kremlin said Navalny had died of natural causes. Although the authorities initially refused to release his body, he was eventually buried in Moscow in March 2024.
His funeral, which was attended by thousands of mourners who defied fears of a police crackdown, was the last time like-minded Russians gathered publicly.
Repression in Russia has steadily intensified over the years, ramping up following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Punitive new laws have been introduced and displays of anti-government stance – whether in the form of street protests or online posts – are routinely met with long prison sentences.
Many associates of Navalny have been jailed or have fled Russia.
His widow Yulia – who has since taken the helm of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation – also faces arrest, and lives abroad alongside their two children.
The Russian opposition in exile is politically fragmented and has struggled to present a united front, with different factions publicly falling out.

What is the dart frog toxin allegedly used to kill Alexei Navalny?,2026-02-16T08:05:27.668Z,No Author Listed,"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a deadly toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America, the UK and some of its European allies have said.
Traces of epibatidine were found in samples from Navalny's body and highly likely resulted in his death in a Siberian penal colony two years ago, the UK Foreign Office said.
The allies said only the Russian state had the ""means, motive and opportunity"" to deploy this lethal toxin.
The Kremlin dismissed the finding as ""an information campaign"", according to Tass news agency.
Epibatidine is a natural neurotoxin isolated from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog, according to toxicology expert Jill Johnson.
It was ""200 times more potent"" than morphine, she told BBC Russian.
Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America as well as being manufactured in a laboratory.
Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia, the European allies said in their statement.
Species known as Anthony's poison arrow frog and the Phantasmal poison frog are among those that secrete the toxin onto their skin.
Although epibatidine has been investigated as a painkiller and for relief from painful inflammatory lung conditions, it is not used clinically because of its toxicity.
This powerful chemical compound acts on nicotinic receptors in the nervous system, according to Johnson.
Because it overstimulates these nerve receptors, if dosed correctly, it can cause muscle twitching, paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and ultimately death, she explained.
Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, told PA that its effects can result in breathing being blocked, and that ""any person poisoned dies from suffocation"".
The toxin being found in someone's blood ""suggests deliberate administration"", he added.
Epibatidine toxicity can even be ""increased by co-administration of certain other drugs and these combinations have been researched"", Hay said.
Epibatidine is extremely rare and found in only one geographic region and only in trace amounts, Johnson said.
It is understood the dart frog referred to by the UK Foreign Office and others was Anthony's poison arrow frog, a species endemic to Ecuador and Peru.
The frogs produce the chemical through eating the right foods to produce alkaloids - a type of organic compound - that make epibatidine and accumulate it in their skin. If the frog's diet changes, its epibatidine reserves will be depleted.
""Finding a wild frog in the right place, eating exactly the food needed to produce the right alkaloids, is almost impossible... almost,"" Johnson said.
""This is an incredibly rare method of human poisoning. The only other cases of epibatidine poisoning I know of were laboratory-based and non-fatal.""
European laboratories confirmed Navalny died from the obscure poison, the allies said on Saturday.
Moscow has previously claimed Navalny died of natural causes, though Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya has consistently argued her husband was ""murdered"" by poisoning.
The Russian embassy in London denied Moscow was involved in Navalny's death and described the announcement as ""feeble-mindedness of Western fabulists"" and ""necro-propaganda"".
Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted by Russian state-run news agency Tass as saying: ""All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems.""
Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former UK and Nato senior officer, who is also a chemical weapons expert, said people should take anything the Kremlin says, including about Navalny's death, ""with a pinch of salt"".
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Nato countries ""have demonstrated that they have the evidence that Navalny was murdered by the state"".
At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years and had latterly been transferred to an Arctic penal colony.
According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.

Ukraine's ex-energy minister detained while attempting to leave country,2026-02-15T17:11:49.003Z," Rachel Muller-Heyndyk
","A former energy minister in Ukraine has been detained while attempting to leave the country, authorities have said.
German Galushchenko, who was forced out of his government role last year after being among officials named in a corruption scandal, was reportedly apprehended while on a train leaving Ukraine. It is unclear where he intended to travel to.
He was one of several government figures implicated in an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scheme in November.
The scandal threatened to engulf Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration, which swept to power before Russia's full-scale invasion on the promise to root out corruption.
Zelensky's chief-of-staff Andriy Yermak - his closest adviser throughout the war - resigned after his home was searched. Neither the president nor Yermak have been accused of any wrongdoing.
The scandal has, however, increased pressure from the US to hold elections, which have been suspended since the start of the war in 2022 due to provisions in Ukraine's constitution.
The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) said in a statement on Sunday that its detectives had detained the former energy minister ""while crossing the state border"", as part of the Midas case.
It did not name Galushchenko explicitly, but he has been named by several prominent Ukrainian media organisations.
Galushchenko was briefly justice minister, a post he held when he was told by Zelensky to resign in November, having served as energy minister for three years prior to that. His successor, Svitlana Hrynchuk, also resigned after being implicated in the scandal.
Nabu gave no further details on Galuschenko's detention, but said it would provide updates in due course.
Radio Free Europe reports that he was being transported to Kyiv for further questioning, after border guards were told to alert the authorities if he attempted to flee.
A massive anti-corruption probe, dubbed Operation Midas, was the culmination of 15 months of investigating, Nabu and Ukraine's other anti-corruption body, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap), said.
They accused several people of orchestrating a scheme to embezzle money in Ukraine's energy sector, including at the national nuclear opertor Energoatom.
Galuschenko was among those alleged to have systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.
The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.
Galushchenko previously said he would defend himself against the accusations.
Former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov was arrested in November on suspicion of ""illicit enrichment"", having already been charged with abuse of office.
Timur Mindich, a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95, reportedly fled the country after he was flagged as a suspect.
That the figures were accused of enriching themselves from Ukraine's energy sector caused particular outrage domestically, as the scandal broke as Russia stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of a bitterly cold winter.
The former Soviet Union member has long been plagued by issues of corruption, which have continued despite Nabu and Sap operating for a decade.
Cracking down on corruption is seen as a key requirement for Ukraine joining the EU.

"UK wants action taken on Russia after Navalny frog poisoning, Cooper says",2026-02-15T12:26:26.724Z," Jennifer McKiernan
Political reporter
","The UK wants action to be taken after evidence showed Russia killed political prisoner Alexei Navalny with frog poison, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.
Two years ago, Russian opposition leader Navalny, a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin, died suddenly in the the Siberian prison where he was being held on trumped-up charges.
European labs have now confirmed he died from the obscure poison, which Cooper says only the Russian government had the ""means, motive and opportunity"" to use.
She told the BBC proof of the toxin was a ""clear breach"" of international chemical weapons rules and ""we do want to see action"" taken, which could include continuing coordinated sanctions on Russia.
Cooper is currently attending the Munich Security Conference alongside Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, where the pair have been calling for European allies to be ready to fight, particularly against threats from Russia.
Appearing on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, she was asked what the consequences would be after evidence showed the Kremlin was responsible for Navalny's death.
Speaking from a snow-covered Munich rooftop, Cooper said Britain and its allies must be ready to face down Russian aggression, which includes ""the use of lethal toxins against their own citizens"".
""We have been pursuing the truth on this since Alexei died in prison,"" she said, in an effort to continue Navalny's work to ""tell the truth, spread the truth"" about the Russian regime under Putin, ""because that is the most dangerous weapon of all"".
""He is no longer able to do that, but that is why we are continuing to do that for him, and for his widow as well,"" she added.
Moscow has previously claimed Navalny died of natural causes, although Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya has consistently argued her husband was ""murdered"" by poisoning.
The tests - carried out by five European countries using samples from his body smuggled out of the prison - showed the substance that killed him was developed from the toxin found in Ecuadorian dart frogs.
The Russian embassy in London has denied Moscow was involved in Navalny's death and described the announcement as ""feeble-mindedness of Western fabulists"" and accused critics of ""necro-propaganda"".
However, Cooper told Kuenssberg the use of poison ""is evidence of the aggression that is unfortunately going to be continuing"" against Europe ""and we need to be ready to respond to that"".
""A group of European ministers has now reported this to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for them to pursue because we see this as a clear breach of the chemical weapons international rules and convention so we do want to see action there, holding some accountability,"" she said.
Asked what specific action could be taken by the UK, Cooper said: ""We continue to look at co-ordinated action, including increasing sanctions on the Russian regime.
""As you know, we have been pursuing this as part of our response to the brutal invasion of Ukraine, where we are also coming up to the fourth anniversary of that invasion as well.
""We believe that it is the partnerships that we build abroad that make us stronger at home. It is by acting alongside our European allies, alongside allies across the world, that we do maintain that pressure on the Russian regime.""
Also appearing on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel called on the government to ""step up its own actions"" against Russia because sanctions are ""being busted and circumvented"".
Speaking from the conference in Munich, she said: ""Action needs to be taken against Russia, there's no doubt about that, and you will recall when Alexei Navalny was murdered back in 2024 it was our government that led the way in terms of sanctions, taking drastic action, calling for the transparent investigation of his murder.
""We need to do much more, I think, when it comes to action against Russia.
""We really need to take direct action against some of the individuals in the UK, the ambassador again needs to be called in.""
Dame Priti argued for ""cutting off all the financial flows that are basically still propping up Russia and the Russian economy"", including closing down Russian oil refineries.
""We've got to target those businesses and go after them,"" she said.
""We've really got to start taking direct action against these financial lifelines that basically are propping up Russia, the Russian state, and this awful permissive Russian activity that we're seeing, including the state sponsored murders and assassinations that the Russian state is so heavily involved in.""
A statement from the Russian embassy in London has continued to deny all involvement in Navalny's death, stating: ""There is no reason whatsoever to credit such 'findings' by Western 'experts'.
""As with the Skripal case, there are strident accusations, media hysteria, zero evidence, and a host of questions the accusers would rather ignore.
""So what was it in the end - poison derived from the skin of a South American frog or Novichok?""
The statement added: ""We have become accustomed to the feeble-mindedness of Western fabulists. One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog.
""Yet what truly shocks is the method now favoured by Western politicians - necro-propaganda. This is not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead.
""Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace - a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign.""

"Russia killed opposition leader Alexei Navalny using dart frog toxin, UK says",2026-02-15T02:04:02.303Z," Adam GoldsmithandTom McArthur
","Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin, the UK and European allies have said.
Two years on from the death of Navalny at a Siberian penal colony, Britain and its allies have blamed the Kremlin following analysis of material samples found on his body.
Speaking from the Munich Security Conference, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said ""only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity"" to use the poison while Navalny was imprisoned in Russia.
According to Tass news agency Moscow has dismissed the finding as ""an information campaign"", but Cooper said there is no explanation for the toxin, called epibatidine, being found.
While Cooper announced the findings, a joint statement was issued by the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.
Cooper met with Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya at the conference this weekend.
""Russia saw Navalny as a threat,"" Cooper said at the event.
""By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition,"" she added.
In the statement the allies said: ""Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.
""Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia.
""There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny's body.""
The Foreign Office said the UK has informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of Russia's alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Praising Navalny's ""huge courage"", UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said ""his determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy"".
""I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin's murderous intent,"" he added.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot also said his country ""pays tribute"" to Navalny, who he suggested was ""killed for his fight in favour of a free and democratic Russia"".
Navalny – an anti-corruption campaigner and Russia's most vociferous opposition leader - died suddenly in jail on 16 February 2024 at the age of 47.
In 2020 he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.
Epibatidine, the toxin the UK and its European allies have said was used to kill Alexei Navalny, was first derived from a group of poison dart frogs native to northern South America.
Though epibatidine has previously been investigated as a pain killer and for relief from painful inflammatory conditions of the lungs, it has been deemed too toxic to use clinically.
Speaking to BBC Russian, toxicology expert Jill Johnson said it was ""200 times more potent than morphine"".
By acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause ""muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death,"" Johnson said.
The extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in particular wild frogs in tiny quantities, and only when the frogs eat a specific diet, she told the BBC.
Researchers believe the frogs acquire it through their diet because animals from different habitats have displayed different levels of the toxin, and those raised in captivity have none.
Johnson described it as an ""incredibly rare way to poison a person"".
She added: ""Finding the wild frog in the correct location that is eating the specific diet to create the correct alkaloids is almost impossible...almost.""
Before Saturday's announcement, Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya had consistently argued that her husband was killed by poisoning while serving a prison sentence in an Arctic penal colony in 2024.
In September last year, Navalnaya said analysis of smuggled biological samples carried out by laboratories in two countries showed that her husband had been ""murdered"".
She did not provide details on the poison allegedly used, on the samples or on the analysis – but challenged the two laboratories to publish their results.
Reacting to the announcement, Navalnaya said: ""I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof.
""I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,"" she added.
According to the state-run news agency Tass, Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: ""All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was ""always a sad event"".
At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to the penal colony.
According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk at his Siberian penal colony, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.

The spectacular multimillion-euro heist nobody noticed,2026-02-15T00:01:17.949Z," Bethany Bell
Germany reporter
","It has been described as Germany's most ""spectacular"" bank heist in years.
On a quiet weekend just after Christmas, a group of thieves broke into a High Street bank in the western town of Gelsenkirchen, by boring through a wall with an industrial drill.
They looted more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes and made off with millions of euros.
Over a month later, police have yet to make an arrest.
For the bank's clients, some of whom say they have lost their life savings and precious family jewellery and valuables, this is a time of anger, confusion and shock.
There is a strong sense that trust in institutions has been shaken.
The case has thrown up all sorts of difficult questions, and some of them have been spelled out by Herbert Reul, the interior minister in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Why did no-one notice what was going on? Was it an insider job?
Why did no-one hear the drill and how did the thieves know exactly where the vault was?
Were the bank's security systems too weak?
Police in Gelsenkirchen are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
Investigators believe the thieves probably broke into the Sparkasse savings bank in Nienhofstrasse through the next-door multi-storey car park in the town's Buer district.
The thieves may have tampered with an escape door between the car park and the bank, they believe.
Under normal circumstances the door could not be opened from the outside, but the gang managed to make sure it no longer closed properly, allowing them ""unhindered access from the car park to the Sparkasse building"".
From there, police believe they overcame several security systems and made their way into an archive room next to the vault, in the bank's basement.
They set up the drill and bored a hole 40cm (15.7in) wide in the wall leading to the strongroom, where the safe deposit boxes were kept.
The heist must have taken place some time between Saturday 27 and Monday 29 December, according to officials, who think the burglars may almost have been caught shortly before reaching the vault.
Just after 06:00 on 27 December, the fire brigade in Gelsenkirchen and a private security firm received a fire alarm warning from the bank, which may have been triggered by the thieves.
Police and 20 firefighters arrived at the bank at 06:15, ""but could not find anything that indicated damage"", police said in a statement.
The fire alarm had come from the vault, Herbert Reul revealed.
But firefighters could not get in because it was locked with a roll shutter. Reul said they saw ""no smoke, no smell of fire, or damage"", so they ""concluded it was a false alarm"", which he said was not unusual.
He told a state parliament committee the police did not have the right to search the bank at the time, as it was a matter for the fire brigade. They would have needed a warrant.
Once inside the vault, the thieves opened almost all the 3,250 safe deposit boxes, taking cash, gold and jewellery.
Reul said that computer systems in the bank show that the first box was broken into at 10:45 on 27 December and the last at 14:44. It is not clear whether they managed to open most of the boxes in four hours or if the technology stopped recording data.
Witnesses later told police they saw several men in the stairwell of the car park carrying big bags during the night into 28 December.
Authorities say they do not know exactly how much was taken, but German media estimate the thieves must have got away with up to €100 million (£87m).
Police subsequently released photos and video footage from the car park's security cameras, which showed men with their faces covered, and two cars, a black Audi RS 6 and a white Mercedes Citan. Both had fake licence plates.
The theft was not discovered until 29 December when another fire alarm went off at 03:58 on the Monday – and firefighters returned to the bank to find a scene of chaos.
Herbert Reul said it looked like ""a rubbish dump"", with more than 500,000 items strewn across the floor - the contents of the safe deposit boxes that the thieves had left behind.
Police said many items were damaged after the thieves threw water and chemicals on them. They have since been painstakingly sorting through the debris, searching for clues and trying to establish what belongs to whom.
As details of the heist emerged, about 200 clients gathered outside the Sparkasse, demanding to be let in. Police arrived with several patrol cars and secured the entrance.
Joachim Alfred Wagner, 63, said he had lost not only gold worth tens of thousands of euros, but also jewellery that belonged to his father and grandparents.
He had rented the safe deposit box after several break-ins at his apartment, thinking that his valuables would be safe there. ""I cried with rage,"" he said.
The bank has said the contents of security boxes are generally insured for €10,300 each.
Wagner is one of the first people to file a lawsuit against the bank, suing for damages for what his lawyer, Daniel Kuhlmann, has called lax security. Another had deposited €400,000 in cash from the sale of a flat which had been meant for their retirement.
The bank has said it was itself a victim of the crime and that its premises were ""secured in accordance with recognised state-of-the-art technology"".
While some clients had official receipts for the contents of their safe deposit boxes, others do not.
""Even the Sparkasse doesn't know what is in [the boxes] because each person can put whatever they want into them,"" Herbert Reul said.
He stressed that the psychological damage shouldn't be underestimated.
""We need to help the victims,"" he said. ""For many, this is more than just the loss of property, this can also impact their trust in their own sense of security and... their trust in our order,"" he said.
Police Chief Tim Frommeyer said they were dealing with ""one of the biggest criminal cases in the history of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia"".
""My department and all of its employees are aware of the magnitude of this case. The financial damage, uncertainty, and frustration run deep!""
Shortly after the theft was discovered, Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party held a rally outside the bank, prompting some to accuse the party of trying to stir up trouble.
German magazine Der Spiegel said the heist had become a political issue and a symbol of something greater than the crime itself: ""The feeling that promises of security are hollow, that institutions are failing, that ultimately no-one is being held accountable.""

"Europe must be ready to fight, PM tells Munich Security Conference",2026-02-14T22:23:54.991Z," Fiona Nimoni
","Europe must be ready to fight to protect its people, values, and way of life, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told world leaders on Saturday.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Starmer also called for deeper links and cooperation, including economic ties, between the UK and EU.
The PM stressed the continent must ""stand on its own two feet"" when it comes to defence commitments.
During his speech, Starmer also said the UK would deploy its carrier strike group to the Arctic and High North as part of efforts to bolster security against Russian threats.
The High North - a term used to describe the northernmost part of the globe - includes the Arctic circle and areas adjacent to it.
Starmer said the US, Canada and other Nato allies would also join the initiative to combat Russian threats in the region.
Russian rearmament following a future peace deal for Ukraine would ""only accelerate"" and Europe must be prepared to ""deter aggression"" and be ready to fight if necessary, he added.
""We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age,"" he told the conference.
US President Donald Trump has previously questioned whether European partners would adhere to the commitment to defend its allies if called upon, known as Article 5.
The alliance was formed in 1949 with the primary aim of blocking expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union.
Numbering 32 members, including several Eastern European countries, Article 5 is one of Nato's core principles. It says that an armed attack against one or more members will be considered an attack against all.
But Starmer sought to dispel Trump's doubts, telling the conference that the UK's commitment to Article 5 is ""as profound now as ever"".
He added: ""Be in no doubt, if called on, the UK would come to your aid today.""
Delivering her speech prior to the PM, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described Starmer as an ""unflinching ally and friend,"" and said both the EU and UK faced the threat of ""outside forces trying to weaken our union from within"".
She said Europe had undergone ""shock therapy"" from the US and must take more responsibility for its defence.
""Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility,"" she added.
Von der Leyen also called for more pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, posting on X: ""Now is the time to raise the costs of Russia's war higher than ever.""
Downing Street said the pair met in Munich on Saturday and ""agreed that Europe needs to step up and work towards becoming a more European Nato"".
Although Starmer's Labour government has worked to ""re-set"" the relationship with Brussels following Brexit in January 2020, it had previously pledged not to return to the single market.
Marking a shift in policy, the PM insisted the EU-UK status quo was ""not fit for purpose"" and acknowledged there would be ""trade-offs"" as a result.
Speaking on ""closer economic alignment"" with the EU, he told the audience: ""We must look at where we could move closer to the single market in other sectors as well, where that would work for both sides.
""The prize here is greater security, stronger growth for the United Kingdom and the EU, which will fuel increased defence spending, and the chance to place the UK at the centre of a wave of European industrial renewal.""
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called for a strengthening of European defence capabilities, ""in a co-ordinated and targeted way"", as well as the need to ""stop Putin"".
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Europe needs to do more collectively when it comes to security in the Arctic region.
Finnish President Alexander Stubb said he did not believe Russia would test the resolve of Article 5, and that he did not see a ""direct threat"" from Russia to Nato currently.
Starmer's speech at the annual Munich Security Conference, an event billed as the world's leading forum for debating challenges to international security, came after a tumultuous week which saw him face the most perilous threat to his premiership so far.
The PM's accepted misjudgement in appointing Peter Mandelson, despite his known links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, had many Labour MPs asking themselves whether they wanted to stick with Starmer.
Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, even went as far as to call for his resignation.
On Monday afternoon, many in Westminster concluded that Starmer would not see out the day without resigning - but his cabinet rallied around him and he survived.
Asked whether domestic challenges left him vulnerable, the PM told the crowd of world leaders and politicians in Munich: ""No, I reject that. I ended the week much stronger than I started it.
""And that's a very good place to be"".

Queen's letter of support left Pelicot 'overwhelmed',2026-02-14T09:24:21.501Z," Tiffany Wertheimer
","Rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot has said she felt ""overwhelmed"" and ""very honoured"" to receive a personal letter of support from Queen Camilla.
The Queen had commended Ms Pelicot for her ""courage"" and ""grace"", writing: ""I very much wanted to write to express my heartfelt admiration for the courage, grace and dignity with which you have faced the horrific crimes committed against you.""
Over the course of nearly a decade, Ms Pelicot was repeatedly drugged and raped by her then-husband, who also invited men he met online to abuse her as well.
The Queen told Ms Pelicot that she had ""inspired women across the globe"" and ""created a powerful legacy that will change the narrative around shame, forever"".
Gisèle Pelicot waived her right to anonymity during the 2024 trial to make the ""shame swap sides"" from the victim to the rapist.
She became a global figurehead of strength and feminism, and during the 15-week trial in Avignon, supporters stood outside the court every day with signs thanking Ms Pelicot for her courage, and calling for justice.
""It was an honour for me to receive this letter, I wasn't expecting it at all,"" Ms Pelicot, 73, told Victoria Derbyshire for BBC Newsnight.
""I was overwhelmed that the Queen could send me this letter.""
The Queen is a long-standing campaigner on domestic and sexual violence and has worked with organisations that support survivors for years.
""Thank you for all that you have done,"" she wrote to Ms Pelicot.
""You are very much in my thoughts and prayers, and I hope that you will now be able to rest and recover from this devastating ordeal.""
It is the first time the contents of the letter have been revealed. But with the Queen and Ms Pelicot's permission, it was shared with the BBC during Ms Pelicot's interview with Newsnight ahead of the release of her memoir: A Hymn To Life.
Ms Pelicot said she was surprised and felt ""very honoured"" when she received the note, ""because although my words touched the whole world, I wasn't expecting a letter from the Court of England"".
""I felt moved and very honoured that she had become aware of what had happened to me. I am grateful to her.""

BBC NewsnightandLaura Gozzi
","Gisèle Pelicot, the woman at the centre of France's largest rape trial, has told BBC Newsnight she was ""crushed by horror"" on discovering that, for years, her husband had repeatedly drugged her unconscious and invited dozens of men to rape her.
""Something exploded inside me,"" says Ms Pelicot, 73, of the moment she realised the scale of her husband's crimes. ""It was like a tsunami.""
In an extensive interview ahead of the publication of her memoir, A Hymn To Life, she describes how phoning her three children with the news of what she had discovered about their father was possibly the toughest experience of her life.
She recalls the moment she decided to waive her legal right to anonymity, and how she has never regretted that decision. She also reveals she still has unanswered questions she wants to ask her now ex-husband - the man she refers to as ""Mr Pelicot"" - in jail, where he is serving a 20-year term.
Warning: This article contains accounts of rape and sexual abuse
The Hôtel de Ville in central Paris, with its ceiling frescoes and rich wood panelling, is a far cry from the drab courtrooms in which Ms Pelicot was last seen publicly, during the four-month trial that shook France.
She describes the moment that marked the beginning of what she calls her ""descent into hell"".
She had accompanied her husband, Dominique Pelicot, to a police station near their home in Mazan, southern France. He had been summoned for secretly filming underneath women's skirts in a supermarket.
Ms Pelicot was taken aside by a policeman, who started asking her a series of increasingly probing questions. What kind of man was her husband? A great guy, she answered. Had they had ever engaged in swinging? No, of course not, she protested.
""He told me: 'I am about to show you something you won't like.' I didn't understand right away.""
The officer showed her two photos of a lifeless woman lying on a bed. They were among thousands of pictures and videos her husband had taken of her while she was drugged.
""I didn't recognise myself,"" she says. ""This woman was lying on the bed as if she were dead. There are men next to her. I didn't understand who they were. I didn't know them. I'd never met them.""
She pauses, fiddling with her red-framed reading glasses. As she recounts the shock that engulfed her, her voice grows quieter but never falters.
Police told Ms Pelicot that she had been repeatedly raped by dozens of men. Although her husband had recorded, labelled and neatly catalogued the videos of the rapes on a hard disk, many of the men could not be identified.
She was advised by the police not to be alone after receiving this news. She went home in a daze and phoned a friend. ""I told her: 'Dominique is in custody because he raped me and had me raped.' That's when I used the word rape. It was after five hours of questioning that I put words to Mr Pelicot's crime.""

Her three grown-up children - David, Caroline and Florian - also had to be told what their father had done.
""I was well aware that for my children it was going to be immensely difficult,"" says Ms Pelicot. She now believes making those three phone calls was the hardest thing she has ever had to do.
She remembers Caroline's reaction: ""I heard my daughter scream. It was almost inhuman, that scream.""
She remembers David, her eldest, being in a state of shock, and Florian, the youngest, immediately asking how she was.
""They realised I was alone, and that I might do something stupid. For them, too, it was like an explosion.""
Her children travelled to be with her in Mazan the following day. All three have since recalled destroying or throwing out the family's belongings - from furniture to photo albums - in an attempt to cancel their father's existence.
Their mother stood by and watched.
""I told myself that my life was in ruins, that I had nothing left apart from my children.""
Since David's birth, when Ms Pelicot was in her early 20s, her children had been the centre of her life. Motherhood became a way to leave behind a childhood steeped in sadness.
""I lost my mother at a very young age, my brother and my father too,"" she recalls. ""So I needed to rebuild everything I had lost.""
In the interview, Ms Pelicot talks of her beloved parents, whose marriage profoundly shaped her own understanding of love.
She was nine when her mother died of cancer, plunging her father and the family into grief they never truly recovered from. Meeting Dominique Pelicot - 19 years old, handsome and just as bruised by a tough upbringing - had provided her with a chance to start anew. They married in 1973.
""We were very in love, and we threw ourselves into life. And we started a family, because that was the main goal for me,"" she recalls in a steady voice.
By 2011, Ms Pelicot had started suffering from memory loss. She attributed this to neurological problems, but she was also suffering from persistent gynaecological issues. These were later proven to have been caused by the sedatives she was plied with, and the strangers who came to rape her multiple times a week.
She consulted a number of doctors. Her husband was by her side throughout the inconclusive examinations. He was also there every morning after the night-time assaults.
""It was inconceivable that this man who shared my life could have committed these horrors,"" says Ms Pelicot. ""I would get up and have breakfast, and he would look at me in the eye. And I don't know how he could have betrayed me for so many years.""
She would later learn that, alongside the drugs, her husband had given her powerful muscle relaxants, so that the next day she would not feel any pain for what her body had been put through.
She now believes her abused body was close to giving up, and that her survival was at risk.
""It is hard for me to recognise that he had no mercy,"" she says.
The revelations have taken their toll on the whole family, says Ms Pelicot.
""It's wrong to think that such a tragedy brings a family together. It took us a long time to rebuild ourselves.""
Her daughter Caroline, in particular, has been condemned to a ""perpetual torment"", she says, as photos of her asleep in her underwear were found on her father's laptop.
""The incestuous look he cast on his daughter, I found utterly unbearable.""
Ms Pelicot's ex-husband has given contradictory explanations for those photos. Caroline is convinced he drugged and raped her too, but lack of additional evidence means he has never been prosecuted.
Relations between mother and daughter were strained during the trial, and Caroline said she felt like a ""forgotten victim"". At various times - both before and after the case – Ms Pelicot lost touch with some of her children.
""It took Caroline time, because she's filled with hatred and anger - feelings I don't have,"" Ms Pelicot says. ""I have neither hatred, nor anger. I felt betrayed and outraged by Mr Pelicot, but that's just how I am.""
Ms Pelicot says she and her daughter are now repairing their relationship.
""Each of us needed time to find our own path. Today, we're trying to bring each other peace, and I hope we're on the right road to healing.""
Revelation was to follow revelation. In 2022, police informed Ms Pelicot that her husband had admitted to the attempted rape of a young woman. He was also being investigated for the killing of a 23-year-old estate agent in Paris in 1991 - an allegation he denies.
That her husband could be a murderer as well as a serial rapist is almost too much for Ms Pelicot to contemplate.
""I dare hope he is not the perpetrator of this heinous crime, because otherwise it would once again be a descent into hell, both for me and for his children.""
While the investigation was taking place, she relocated to the quiet Île de Ré, a small island off France's Atlantic coast. ""I really wanted to stay in the shadows,"" she says. ""I absolutely didn't want anyone to know who I was.""
As is the case for rape victims in France, Ms Pelicot was entitled to a closed-door trial - full anonymity, no media. She had pushed back on suggestions from her daughter to have an open hearing, worried about cementing her status as the victim of a heinous crime.
Then, walking on the beach, four months before the case began, something within her shifted.
A closed hearing would mean the men on trial would also benefit from anonymity, she realised. Moreover, it would leave her outnumbered - 51 men and 40 lawyers versus her, her small legal team, and her children.
""For more than four years, I carried this shame,"" says Ms Pelicot. ""And I felt that it was like a double punishment for victims, and a suffering we imposed on ourselves.""
Her lawyers gave her a week to decide whether she truly wanted to open the trial up to the public and the media. She only needed one night. ""By the next morning, I knew,"" she says.
It was an extraordinary choice.
""I have never regretted my decision, not once,"" she says. ""It was also a message to all victims who don't dare to do the same… It could give them some of the strength I found in me.
""Because,"" she says without hesitation, ""within us we have resources that we don't even suspect. And if I was able to do this, all victims can too. I am convinced of this.""
In 2024, the Pelicot trial exploded into full view of France and the world.
The ability to let the light shine through the depravity Ms Pelicot was subjected to - the ""filth"", as she repeatedly calls it - is a testament to her resilience.
Every day, she held her head high as she walked into the Avignon courthouse. A throng of women assembled outside to show their support, and she acknowledged them with a slight nod and a hand on her heart.
Surrounded by dozens of cameras, Ms Pelicot says they gave her ""unbelievable strength"".
""For me, they soothed what was happening within the courtroom,"" she says. ""On my own, I think it would have been difficult.""
Even Queen Camilla reached out from the UK to express her admiration with a personal letter, which surprised her. ""I felt moved and very honoured... I am grateful to her,"" she says.
Throughout the interview, Ms Pelicot is composed and assured. Then, she is shown videos of French women, filmed by Newsnight, thanking her for her choice to have an open hearing.
""Thank you for being so brave,"" says one woman.
""We are here to support you! Life is beautiful, madame!"" says another.
As one beaming face follows the next, Ms Pelicot, for the first time, wipes away a tear.
""It touches me enormously because these are the faces I met during the trial,"" she says. ""I saw them putting up posters, I saw their collages, I saw the banners.""
""They were truly exceptional,"" she smiles.
In the courtroom, Ms Pelicot and her family sat through nearly four months of veiled insinuations and open accusations of complicity from both the defendants and their lawyers. ""You go through hell in a courtroom. You're really humiliated,"" she says.
At the time, this led her to label what was unfolding as the ""trial of cowardice"". Now, too, her voice rises slightly as she recalls those moments.
""They didn't want to own up to what they had done,"" she says of the 50 men her husband had allowed to abuse her. She feels they acted as if they had committed a petty crime and refused to accept that she could not have given consent.
""Then, the video attesting to the truth would be shown,"" she says. ""We could see that man raping me. He'd be asked those questions again, and would reply: 'No, I didn't rape her, I didn't have any intention of raping her.'
""So where are we supposed to go from there?"" she wonders aloud, exasperated.
""I think that as far as they're concerned, they couldn't have raped me because Mr Pelicot was there and had given his consent. Therefore, they didn't consider it rape,"" she concludes.
The argument was rejected by the seven judges who oversaw the case. All the defendants were found guilty. Her former husband (their divorce was finalised shortly before his trial) was given a maximum sentence of 20 years. The other 50 men were jailed for terms between five and 15 years.
As Ms Pelicot speaks, a tall bespectacled widower named Jean-Loup watches on discreetly. She met him on Île de Ré in 2023. ""We had this stroke of luck,"" she says, her voice measured and warm. ""We fell in love like teenagers, when neither of us was expecting it.""
They have been a couple ever since. ""Life put a man on my path who has the same values, the same principles as me - and who has also been through many ordeals in his life.""
""So you see,"" she continues, her head tilting to one side, ""life always holds beautiful surprises. It's brought a lot of colour into our lives.""
It has been almost six years since Ms Pelicot was shown the photos of a woman who looked ""dead"". The question of why her ex-husband subjected her to years of abuse still looms large. Dominique Pelicot admitted in court he wanted to ""subdue an unbreakable woman"".
""He would have liked me to participate in swinging sessions and I always refused because I have a sense of modesty,"" she says. ""I think he found a way around it by subduing me.""
But how he could have brought himself to do what he did is a different question. ""I might ask myself this for the rest of my life,"" she says.
Ms Pelicot says she intends to visit him in jail to ask him what he may have done to their daughter Caroline, and the murder case he has been linked to.
""I need to meet him to have answers. I don't know if I will, but I need to look at him straight in the eye.""
Meanwhile, the rebuilding of her life continues. ""I am healing,"" she says.
She resists the idea of entirely disavowing the life she led with her ex-husband.
""In order to live, I have needed to think that the 50 years I spent with Mr Pelicot were not all just a lie. Because otherwise, it's as if I'd been dead. As if I no longer existed.""
During one of the rare times she took the stand in court, Ms Pelicot told her ex-husband that his betrayal had been ""immeasurable"".
""I always tried to lead you towards the light, but you chose the depths of the human soul,"" she said.
It is a sentiment she echoes now. In life, she says, ""you always have to choose, to decide which path to follow. There is the good and the bad.""
""As for me,"" she concludes in her poised voice, ""I have always chosen to walk toward the good.""

Two Britons among three dead in French Alps avalanche,2026-02-14T02:55:21.841Z," Ian Casey
","Two Britons and one French person have died in an avalanche in the French Alps on Friday.
The British pair were part of a group of five people skiing off-piste with an instructor in the Manchet valley, near Val d'Isère, a spokeswoman for the resort told the BBC.
The French national was skiing alone when the avalanche struck at 11:30 local time (10:30 GMT), Albertville prosecutor Benoit Bachelet said in a statement announcing the deaths.
Another British person has minor injuries, he added.
A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told the BBC they are aware of the death of the two British men and they are ""in contact with the local authorities and stand ready to offer consular assistance"".
A manslaughter investigation has now been launched by the Albertville public prosecutor's office and will be carried out by CRS Alpes mountain rescue police.
The ski instructor, who was unharmed, tested negative after taking alcohol and drug tests, according to Bachelet.
Antoine Martignon and his wife were in La Vallée du Manchet on Friday morning, and captured the avalanche on video.
The pair had initially tried to ski in Val d'Isère, but found the slopes too crowded and decided to go for a walk.
""I was watching people free riding and skiing off-piste, and thought it looks very dangerous,"" said Martignon.
""In 20 seconds there was an avalanche, it went down and took people below.""
Val d'Isère has already experienced avalanches this winter, with one person dying in the resort of Tignes nearby last month.
France's national weather service had issued a red alert for avalanche risk across the Savoie region on Thursday, which was then lifted on Friday. But the risk level remained high across the Alps with ""very unstable snow cover"".
The avalanche comes in the wake of Storm Nils, which passed through France the day before, leaving between 60cm and 100cm of snow, the weather service said.
There have been a number of fatal avalanches in the region in recent weeks, including the death of a British man off-piste skiing at the La Plagne resort in January.
""We have had some very complicated, very unstable snow since the beginning of the season,"" Luc Nicolino, slopes manager at La Plagne, told AFP.
""It's a kind of mille-feuille with many hidden, fragile layers.""

France probes baby formula producers over contamination recalls,2026-02-13T22:30:17.599Z," Aleks Phillips
","Prosecutors in Paris have opened investigations into five baby formula manufacturers after several issued mass recalls over concerns their product contained a toxin.
Nestle, Lactalis, Danone, Babybio and La Marque en moins will be probed over whether there was any criminal wrongdoing in distributing baby formula that may have been contaminated with cereulide.
French authorities have received complaints from eight individuals who reported their child vomited after consuming baby formula.
Last week, Nestle and Danone issued recalls in more than 60 countries, including the UK, over potentially contaminated batches.
At least 36 infants in the UK have suffered from suspected food poisoning after consuming baby formula, officials have said.
Cereulide is a toxin which is unlikely to be destroyed through cooking or when making baby milk. If consumed, it can cause nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps.
The toxin in baby formula was linked to an ingredient called arachidonic acid (ARA) oil, which gives it some of the same growth properties as breast milk.
The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) earlier said a third-party supplier of ARA was the source of the contamination and was no longer being used.
That supplier is now widely thought to be a Chinese firm, which Agence France-Presse identified as Wuhan-based Cabio Biotech. The BBC has approached the company for comment.
On Thursday, China's national market regulator told domestic baby formula manufacturers to test for cereulide, without mentioning specific companies.
Prosecutors in Paris will seek to establish whether the baby formula producers are liable for distributing a tainted product.
It will be co-ordinated with local probes into whether there was a causal link between the contaminated formula and the deaths of three babies in France. Nestle and France's health ministry have stressed there was as-yet no evidence to indicate such a link.
So far 28 batches of baby formula produced by Nestle, which makes SMA, and Danone, which makes Aptamil and Cow & Gate, have been recalled.
Danone and Nestle have given assurances to the FSA that recalled batches were produced some time ago and were unlikely still to be on UK shop shelves.
However, they may be in cupboards at home, which is why parents and caregivers are being asked to check their supplies.
Nestle said on Friday that it intended to run five factories around the clock to increase baby formula production after the global recall. Those factories are in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
""We are focused on increasing the availability of infant formula to meet demand, providing parents and families with high quality products they can trust,"" the Swiss firm said.

The war dead pictured on banned Ukrainian athlete's helmet,2026-02-13T18:14:06.559Z," Alys Davies
","Ukrainian skeleton slider Vladyslav Heraskevych's disqualification from the Winter Olympics over his helmet depicting fellow athletes killed since Russia's full-scale invasion is the Games' biggest controversy so far.
Heraskevych was barred from the men's skeleton in Milan-Cortina earlier this week after he refused to stop wearing it and on Friday his appeal was denied.
He has said those featured on his helmet include teenage weightlifter Alina Perehudova, boxer Pavlo Ishchenko and ice hockey player Oleksiy Lohinov, adding that some of them were his friends.
More than 20 athletes appear on the helmet in total - here's more on each of them.
Androschuk died a few days after his 22nd birthday in January 2025 while fighting in the Bakhmut area of eastern Ukraine.
He represented his country at the international level, competing in decathlon and pentathlon events.
At one time he had hoped to qualify for the 2024 Olympics in Paris or the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, the New York Times reported, but by 2022 injuries meant he decided to volunteer for the army instead.
""It was his dream,"" Oleksiy Kasyanov, the general secretary of Ukraine's track and field federation and formerly its national decathlon coach, told the paper in reference to Androschuk's sporting ambitions.
Bakhur was killed last year during Russian shelling in the Kharkiv region, north-eastern Ukraine.
The 17-year-old was a kickboxing champion who represented Ukraine at national and international level.
She died a few weeks before her 18th birthday after suffering shrapnel wounds while running for shelter in the city of Berestyn.
Speaking to Ukrainian newspaper Pravda after her death, Bakhur's coach, Volodymyr Zibarov, said the athlete ""had enormous potential"".
""We were supposed to leave tonight for the World Cup in Austria... Russian missile simply took Karyna from us one day earlier,"" he said.
Eleven-year-old Diachenko was a promising gymnast who died in the south-eastern city of Mariupol in March 2022, according to the memorial website Angels of Sport.
She had been inside her home with her family when a Russian air strike hit the building, killing her and her father instantly. Her mother and brother were taken to hospital, which was later hit by an air strike, killing them too.
Halinichev died in 2023 in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine.
According to Ukrainian sports news outlet Tribuna, he refused to participate in a 2022 European boxing championship in order to volunteer as a soldier.
Speaking to Voice of America, one of his coaches said once Halinichiev had seen the destruction caused by the war, he felt he had to fight.
""I have a little child. I don't want her to live in occupation among the aggressor, among the Russians,"" another of his coaches quoted him as saying.
Tribuna said Halinichev was injured twice during the war but continued to fight until his death.
He won silver at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games and the 2021 European U22 Championships.
Ishchenko from Kyiv was a four-time strongman champion and former Ukrainian powerlifting champion.
He was also a coach, mentoring young people.
Ukrainian outlet Sport.ua said following his death: ""His legacy continues to inspire new generations of athletes who see in him a model of resilience, courage, and dedication to sport and the country.""
He died last year on the front lines.
Nine-year-old Ivashko was a judo enthusiast who was killed while trying to shelter from Russian air strikes alongside her mother in Kyiv in June 2023.
Following her death, the Ukrainian Judo Federation's president Mykhailo Koshlyak said Ivashko's death was ""painful for the entire Ukrainian judo family"".
Khabarov, 31, was a ""stalwart"" of the Ukrainian national shooting sport for over a decade, according to the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF).
During his career he was a national record holder on multiple occasions, as well as a national champion.
In 2023 he joined the army and died in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine last year.
""He was an elite athlete who paused his career to defend his country, and will forever be in the hearts and memories of the Ukrainian people,"" ISSF president Luciano Rossi said in a statement following his death.
Kononenko was a competitive strongman as well as an actor who starred in popular Ukrainian TV programmes.
He went to fight on the front lines in February 2022 and by November had suffered a severe injury, Pravda reported.
He designed his own rehabilitation programme, which he shared with others on social media, before later going back to fight on the front, becoming a senior lieutenant and commander of a rifle platoon.
Contact with him was lost during a combat mission in February last year and in December he was declared killed in action.
Kozubenko was a diver and coach from Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine.
He died in combat last year aged 31.
""In the country's most difficult time, Kozubenko took up arms to defend his native land,"" the Ukrainian Sports Comittee said when announcing his death.
Kurdel was a 20-year-old dancer who died in the central city of Kryvyi Rih in July 2022 during a Russian air attack.
She had been training at a sports ground with her father at the time of the attack. Her parents were also injured but survived.
Kurdel won a number of international dance competitions before her death.
Kutsenko was a track cycling champion who had competed for Ukraine between 2006 and 2016, representing his country at European and World championships.

Orban rival accuses opponents of blackmail plot ahead of Hungary election,2026-02-13T16:27:53.701Z," Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor
","Less than two months before Hungary's election, opposition leader Peter Magyar has accused his rivals of planning to blackmail him with a secretly recorded sex tape, and says he is filing a complaint with authorities.
Magyar, who leads long-time Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the polls, said he suspected there were plans to release a tape of him from August 2024, when he says he engaged in consensual sex with a now ex-girlfriend at a party.
He was responding to a photo recently posted online of a bedroom in an apartment dating back to then.
Leading figures in Orban's Fidesz party said they knew nothing about the claims. The BBC has approached Orban's spokesman for comment.
Magyar accused Fidesz of trying to blackmail him and made three allegations of unlawful conduct in a statement on Friday.
Although no video has been published, he said one from that date would have been ""recorded with secret service equipment and possibly faked"".
Magyar made no mention in his statement of the ex-girlfriend he had been with at the time of the alleged incident, although he said on Thursday he had accused her of extortion 15 months ago - an allegation she denied.
She told Hungarian media that they were both victims regarding the alleged illicit video and she was ready to take legal action with him.
Magyar accused Fidesz leaders of timing their campaign to coincide with the start of his nationwide campaign next week, and of trying to ruin the last week he was spending with his three sons ahead of the April election.
Fidesz communications director Tamas Menczer accused Magyar of lying, while Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told reporters he could not comment on something he knew nothing about.
Orban, Hungary's nationalist leader, has been in office for 16 years, but with parliamentary elections on 12 April, Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is at least eight points ahead in the latest opinion poll by Hungary's Idea Institute.
Fidesz has so far focused its campaign on attacking the European Union, accusing Brussels of trying to bring down his government. He is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has called on the EU to stop sending money to Ukraine.
On Friday, US President Donald Trump praised Orban as a ""truly strong and powerful leader"", ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump said he had been ""proud to ENDORSE Viktor"" for re-election in 2022 and was ""honoured to do so again"".
The election campaign is not even due to start until 21 February, but Magyar's allegations of dirty tricks are an indication of how murky the next few weeks may become.
Magyar has built support across Hungary over the past two years, promising to reset relations with Hungary's European partners.
A one-time Fidesz loyalist, he was once married to former justice minister Judit Varga, whose political career ended during a scandal in 2024. They divorced the year prior.

Leak damages 19th Century painting in latest Louvre setback,2026-02-13T15:06:49.266Z," Anna LamcheandMarianne Baisnee
in Paris
","A water leak at the Louvre has caused damage to a 19th Century ceiling painting, in the latest major setback for the Parisian museum.
Water damage was discovered in room 707, also known as the ""Duchâtel"" room, late on Thursday night, the museum said. The room houses multiple 15th and 16th Century artworks.
The museum said the leak - from a heating pipe - was stopped shortly after midnight and the only painting damaged was Charles Meynier's The Apotheosis of Poussin, Le Sueur and Le Brun.
It comes a day after French police reportedly detained nine people - including two museum staff - over a suspected ticket fraud scheme.
Museum bosses have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months, after thieves stole priceless French crown jewels from the museum in broad daylight and hundreds of books were damaged in a leak.
The Louvre said Thursday night's leak occurred at the entrance to the paintings department in the Denon wing.
It said firefighters responded ""immediately"" and the leak was stopped 40 minutes after it began.
A painting restorer inspected Meynier's ceiling painting on Friday morning and found it had ""two tears in the same area, caused by the water, and the paint layer on the ceiling and its arches has lifted"".
The ceiling painting, signed by Meynier in 1822, depicts lauded French painters Nicolas Poussin, Eustache Le Sueur, and Charles Le Brun, who appear in the clouds among angelic figures.
Rooms 706, 707 and 708 in the Denon wing on the building's first floor were closed on Friday morning, but are expected to reopen later in the day.
The chief architect of historic monuments also came to assess the condition of the ceiling, the Louvre said, but found there were no structural problems.
A union representative told news agency Reuters that scaffolding had been erected in the affected area.
The cost of the damage to the painting and the building remains unclear.
This leak is the latest in a long series of problems faced by the museum, which is the most visited in the world, in the recent past.
In December, 300-400 pieces, mostly books, were damaged by a leak in the Louvre's Egyptian department. At the time, the museum's deputy administrator, Francis Steinbock, said the problem that caused the leak had been known about for years.
The month prior, structural weaknesses prompted the partial closure of one of the galleries hosting Greek vases and offices.
This came shortly after a high-profile heist on 19 October in which four burglars made off with historic jewellery worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring gaps in the musuem's security.
The brazen theft involved a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift, which was used to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.
Several people have been arrested in relation to the heist, which the French police are still investigating.
The majority of the stolen pieces have still not been recovered and the museum has since moved some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France.
A report published in October by France's public audit body criticised the museum's excessive spending on artwork, which it said was ""to the detriment of the maintenance and renovation of buildings.""

IOC criticised for selling Nazi-era Olympics T-shirt,2026-02-12T20:37:06.707Z," Bethany Bell
Germany reporter
","The official online fan shop of the Olympic Games has been selling T-shirts with designs from the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936, which were used by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis for propaganda.
There are calls in Germany for the sale of the shirts to be stopped, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has defended it as being part of its Heritage Collection, celebrating styles from all editions of the Games.
The T-shirts, which are emblazoned with the original poster design for the Berlin Olympics by Franz Würbel, are currently out of stock.
The 1936 Games were used by Hitler as a chance to promote his ideals of racial supremacy and to glorify Nazi Germany on an international stage.
The Berlin T-Shirt shows a male figure wearing a laurel wreath. Over his head are the Olympic rings. Underneath him is the Brandenburg Gate and the words ""Germany Berlin 1936 Olympic Games"".
""The 1936 Olympic Games were a central propaganda tool of the Nazi regime,"" Klara Schedlich, spokesperson for sports policy for the Green Party faction in the Berlin House of Representatives, told the German press agency, DPA.
She accused the IOC of ""clearly not reflecting sufficiently on its own history"" and said ""the choice of image is problematic and unsuitable for a T-shirt"", without context.
The IOC told the BBC that while it ""of course acknowledge[s] the historical issues of Nazi propaganda"" it wanted to also remember that the Berlin 1936 Games saw ""4,483 athletes from 49 countries compete in 149 medal events"".
""We made an Olympic Heritage Collection available to the public that celebrates 130 years of Olympic art and design. For this series, emblems, pictograms, posters and mascots from all editions of the Olympic Games are featured,"" a spokesperson said.
""Many of them stunned the world with their athletic achievements, including Jesse Owens.""
Jesse Owens, an African-American track and field athlete, won four gold medals at the 1936 Games, crushing the Nazi myth of Aryan racial supremacy.
The spokesperson said that the historical context of the Berlin Games was explained at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, and that only a limited number of 1936 T-Shirts had been produced and sold.

Norway's former PM charged with gross corruption over Epstein links,2026-02-12T16:37:32.629Z," Alicia Curry
","Former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland has been charged with ""gross corruption"" over his ties with the US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, police have said.
The charge was brought after the Council of Europe lifted Jagland's immunity, which he enjoyed because of his past diplomatic role. He denies criminal liability and is willing to cooperate, his lawyer says.
Emails released by the US government are thought to show that Jagland planned solo and family visits to Epstein's homes in Paris, New York and Palm Beach after the billionaire was convicted of a child sex offence.
Three of Jagland's properties were searched by Norwegian crime unit Økokrim and he is now expected to be questioned.
As well as serving as prime minister from 1996 to 1997, Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent a decade as secretary general of the Council of Europe.
Jagland had diplomatic immunity from heading the Council, Europe's watchdog for democracy and human rights, for alleged acts carried out during his 2009 to 2019 tenure.
Økokrim requested the Council revoke his immunity after it launched an investigation earlier this month into allegations of gross corruption made against him between 2011 and 2018.
The so-called Epstein files appear to show instances where the late financier covered the travel expenses to his properties for Jagland and his family.
The former leader had planned a family trip to Epstein's private Caribbean island in 2014, but it was ultimately cancelled after Epstein fell ill.
Jagland also faces allegations that he solicited Epstein's help in obtaining a bank loan in another exchange, although it is not clear whether this materialised, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. Police have not confirmed whether this allegation is part of the gross corruption charge.
Mention in the Epstein files - which have been released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) - does not indicate any wrongdoing.
Jagland was seen walking out of his home alongside his lawyer in Oslo on Thursday, one of the properties - alongside two in Risør and Rauland - that Økokrim confirmed it had searched.
Politicians, celebrities and royals have been caught up in the turmoil after the US DOJ published the latest tranche of files last month, containing millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into the late sex offender - who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.
The Nordic country has seen several public figures drawn into the widening scandal, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit, diplomats Mona Juul and Terje Rød-Larsen, and chief executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende.
Mette-Marit gave a ""profound apology"" to Norwegians for her friendship with Epstein, after it emerged they had exchanged messages for three years.
Mona Juul and her husband Terje Rød-Larsen are also being investigated by Norway's Økokrim for ""aggravated corruption"" following Norwegian media reports, that each of her children would receive $5m (£3.6m) in a will allegedly signed by Epstein days before he died.
Juul's lawyer has said she ""does not recognise the accusations made against her"" and Rød-Larsen's lawyer said he is confident the investigation will clarify ""there is no basis for criminal liability"".
The WEF ordered an independent review into Brende - who also served as the Norwegian foreign minister - over his interactions with the paedophile.
Brende has acknowledged dining with Epstein three times in 2018 and 2019 and communicating with him by email and text, but said he was ""completely unaware"" of his past criminal activity. He added that he welcomes the WEF's decision to launch a review.

US man found not guilty of father's murder by reason of insanity,2026-02-12T16:32:32.162Z,No Author Listed,"An American man who killed his father at a five-star Irish hotel has been found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity.
Henry McGowan, 31, from Clinton Street, Brooklyn, New York, killed his 66-year-old father John McGowan at Ballyfin Demesne on 12 November 2024.
The court heard two consultant psychiatrists, for the defence and prosecution, agreed Henry McGowan was suffering from schizoaffective disorder at the time of the killing.
McGowan suffered a relapse of his mental health during a trip around Europe, and his father had travelled from the US to Ireland to take him back.
Irish broadcaster RTÉ reports that Henry Mcgowan had travelled to Dublin on 11 November, where he claimed he ran from Dublin Airport to the city centre.
The next day he went to the Mater Hospital where he was prescribed medication.
His family had become deeply concerned about him and his father flew from the US on what was described as a mission of mercy to bring him home.
However, within hours of reuniting with his son, John McGowan had been killed by Henry, who was going through a psychotic episode.
The case will be back in court again on 20 February, when the judge will hear evidence about the proposed treatment programme for Henry McGowan.

"Motorway collapses as deadly storms hit France, Portugal and Spain",2026-02-12T13:00:27.857Z," Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor
","A lorry-driver was killed by a falling tree as Storm Nils swept across western France, leaving 900,000 homes without power.
Gales of 162km/h (100mph) were reported near France's south-west coast, and Alpine ski resorts in the east closed because of the high risk of avalanche, including La Plagne.
In Portugal a section of the A1 motorway linking Lisbon to Porto collapsed when a river burst its banks near Coimbra.
The storms caused significant disruption to transport in Spain, with schools suspended in Catalonia in the north-east, the Basque country on red alert for waves of up to 10m (32ft) on the north-west coast, and winds of 148km/h recorded at Alicante in the south-east.
A number of people were hurt in accidents in Spain.
In the Barcelona area, four workers were injured as they cleared fallen trees and a pedestrian was hurt when a wall collapsed. Dozens of flights were cancelled at the city's El Prat airport.
Meanwhile, a woman had to be rescued when her car fell into a sinkhole that emerged on a road near the western town of Cáceres.
Across the border in central Portugal, a 10m section of the A1 motorway collapsed after the Mondego river burst its banks, and the flooded river breached the Casais do Campo dyke.
The stretch of motorway had already been closed before it collapsed.
Visiting the scene on Thursday, Infrastructure Minister Miguel Pinto Luz said it would take weeks for the road to be repaired.
This week alone, the government says Portugal has experienced 20% of its annual average rainfall, but the poor weather has been going on for weeks, battering the country's infrastructure.
""Since the start of January, discharges from dams and reservoirs have been the equivalent of about a year of our country's water consumption,"" Maria Graça Carvalho told Portuguese media.
Authorities are also closely watching the River Tagus, where they say the flow of water from three dams was 6,500 cubic metres per second Thursday morning.
Interior Minister Maria Lucia Amaral resigned earlier this week following political criticism of her handling of the worsening conditions, which have left several people dead and caused billions of euros in damage.
Even before the latest storm, Portugal had endured Storm Kristin, Leonardo and Storm Marta.
While winter storms are not uncommon, scientists say the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events on the Iberian Peninsula is partly down to climate change linked to rising greenhouse gas emissions.
Meanwhile, in France, red alerts were declared in several areas in the south-west, south and south-east.
In the southern Aude region 40 roads were declared impassable with gales of up to 110km/h.
Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot paid tribute to the lorry driver killed in the Landes region and appealed to the public to ""exercise utmost caution when travelling and check with their transport operator before any journey"".
Police told French media that a tree fell on the man's vehicle and a branch went through his windscreen.
Elsewhere a worker was seriously hurt when a tree fell on his vehicle at Castelsarrasin north of Toulouse.

Roadworks causing 'traffic chaos' for town,2026-02-12T06:31:40.754Z," CJ McGinley
BBC News NI
","People in County Donegal's largest town have hit out at what they say are chronic traffic problems caused by roadworks, which are due to continue for six months.
Jimmy Stafford, president of Letterkenny chamber of commerce, said motorists are facing lengthy delays as a result of the Active Travel projects, which include the creation of bike lanes.
Donegal County Council (DCC) said the works should help ""alleviate congestion in Letterkenny"" once completed.
Some traders have also complained that the ongoing roadwords are losing them business.
Letterkenny, a town of about 22,000 people, has close links to Londonderry in Northern Ireland, with many people making the 20.5m (33km) half-hour daily commute between the two places to work or study.
Large numbers of people from Derry and other parts of Northern Ireland also regularly travel through Letterkenny to get to holiday homes in places like Dunfanaghy, Gweedore and Downings, as well as to the west of Ireland.
The governments in Northern Ireland and the Republic have long-terms plans to restore the cross-border railway line between Letterkenny and Derry, then onto Portadown.
This has been identified as key to improving cross-border rail connections.
The Irish government has invested more than €1bn (£870m) in active travel schemes since 2020, with an estimated €360m (£313m) earmarked for projects in 2026.
Active travel schemes help to develop walking and cycling projects that offer safe, sustainable and healthy transport options.
BBC Radio Foyle has contacted The National Transport Authority (NTA) for comment.
Fianna Fáil councillor Donal ""Mandy"" Kelly said he receives calls every day, particularly in the morning, due to the heavy build-up of traffic on the four-lane route into the town.
Problem areas include Dromore, Windyhall and Oldtown.
""The view of many people in Letterkenny is that works on Active Travel projects are a major hindrance, causing traffic congestion,"" he said.
""I've had numerous calls from bus operators who can't get children to school on time, as well as from businesses.
""A well-established business owner who has invested millions recently is reporting that staff are arriving late for work due to traffic delays around the town.""
Leonard Watson, who owns Watson Menswear in Letterkenny, believes the town is a victim of its own success due to the large numbers of people travelling there for work and shopping.
""Letterkenny is a busy town,"" he said.
""We have something like 25,000 people coming into the town in the morning and leaving again in the evening.""
While his trade is down, he said the traffic situation outside peak hours is not a major problem.
Brian Gallagher, who owns the Station House Hotel, said the authorities need to find a solution to the ""traffic gridlock"" in the town.
""The solution to this problem is the construction of a new bridge across the River Swilly,"" he said. ""We've been campaigning for this bridge for up to 40 years.
""Letterkenny is the main town in Donegal and there is massive employment, with 3,500 staff going to work in the hospital every day, another 4,000 students at ATU (Atlantic Technological University) and social welfare workers.
""A lot of traffic wouldn't have to come into the town at all if we had a new bridge over the River Swilly and another relief road to the south of the town.""
Gallagher believes the whole of County Donegal is hindered by a lack of suitable infrastructure.

"Six dead in suspected murder-suicides in Bulgarian mountains, officials say",2026-02-11T23:06:58.648Z," Maia Davies
","Six people have been found dead in suspected murder-suicides in a mountain range in western Bulgaria, officials have said.
Three bodies, including that of a 15 year old, were found in a van parked in a remote area of Stara Planina on Sunday. Investigators said they were connected to three others found dead near a burned-down hut six days prior.
Officers said CCTV footage showed the two groups saying goodbye to each other at the hut, with the three who remained at the scene later filmed setting it on fire.
Bulgaria's acting prosecutor general Borislav Sarafov said the case contained ""more shocking details"" than Twin Peaks - the drama about a murder investigation in a US logging town.
Prosecutors have said the deaths were likely murder-suicides or suicides - sparking fevered speculation in the country and criticism of the investigation.
The national police chief branded the case an ""unprecedented crime"" unlike any other seen before in the country.
The first three men - aged 45, 49 and 51 - were found dead near a burned-down hut on 2 February, local media reported citing Bulgaria's interior ministry.
All had gunshot wounds and there were ""no signs of a struggle"" or further trauma, Natalia Nikolova from the Appeal Prosecutor's Office in Sofia told reporters on Monday.
Forensic experts determined that shots had been fired from close range.
According to the Reuters news agency, two handguns and a rifle were found at the scene near the Petrohan mountain pass, about an hour's distance from the capital Sofia.
Six days later, officers found two men and a 15-year-old boy dead in a parked camper van near Mount Okolchista.
""The individuals are connected to the Petrohan case,"" national police chief Zahari Vaskov told reporters.
He said they had wounds from shots which appeared to have been fired inside the vehicle. Prosecutors later said autopsies indicated there had likely been two murders and one suicide.
Most of the victims belonged to a nature protection NGO, officials said.

"Russian strike kills 3 Ukrainian toddlers and father, with pregnant mother injured",2026-02-11T16:08:10.997Z," Claire KeenanandJaroslav Lukiv
","An overnight Russian drone strike has killed three toddlers and their father and also injured their pregnant mother in Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region, local officials say.
Regional head Oleh Synegubov said Ivan and Vladyslav, two-year-old twin boys, and their one-year-old sister Myroslava died when their house was hit in the town of Bohodukhiv. Their father was named as Hryhoriy, aged 34.
The toddlers' mother Olha, 35, had minor burns - but survived.
Russia has renewed its almost daily drone and missile strikes after a week-long pause earlier this month that Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.
In a statement on social media, Synegubov described the Russian attack on Bohodukhiv as ""brutal"".
He said that the family that was in the hit house had recently evacuated from a town near the Russian border, trying to escape constant shelling.
""It was their first night in the new place,"" the regional head added.
Bohodukhiv, north-west of Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv, has been under almost daily Russian attack in recent days.
On Monday, a 41-year-old woman and a 10-year-old boy were killed in the town, local officials said.
Russian forces also dropped seven bombs on the city of Slovyansk on Tuesday, Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram. Three people, including an 11-year-old girl, were killed.
Moscow has increased pressure on the area by targeting transport and energy infrastructure with a record number of ballistic missiles, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
A state of emergency has been declared over the energy situation in the Kharkiv region by local authorities.
It comes after a so-called ""energy truce"", which was meant to allow Ukraine's energy sector a reprieve during -20C (-4F) temperatures, expired last week.
Tens of thousands of people across Ukraine are experiencing severe power cuts, and many households have no running water or heating.
Zelensky has said the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, and that both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week.
Meanwhile, a massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Volzhsky, in the Volgograd region in Russia, was reported on Wednesday night.
Regional Governor Andrei Bocharov said an apartment was damaged in the strike and a fire broke out at a factory.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Taoiseach names Stakeknife in Irish parliament,2026-02-11T15:51:28.544Z," Gabija Gataveckaite
BBC News NI Dublin correspondent
","Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin has named the army agent known as Stakeknife, Freddie Scappaticci, in the Dáil (Irish parliament).
Martin named the west Belfast man, who died in 2023, during a Dáil debate on the report of Operation Kenova.
The final report of an investigation into his crimes, which cost £47.5m, was published last year but its authors could not secure government permission to name Stakeknife.
Scappaticci was alleged to have been the most high-ranking British agent within the Provisional IRA, who was given the code-name Stakeknife by the army.
Martin told the Dáil his identity is ""clear to everybody here"".
""I have previously stated that the agent should be officially named by the UK government,"" he said.
""Particularly because of his close relationship with those who like to refer to themselves as the republican movement, it is widely known that Stakeknife was Freddie Scappaticci.""
He said the agent was recruited by the British Army and worked with it between the late 1970s and 1990s.
Scappaticci was a ""prized informant and during this period, the British Army dedicated a 24-hour phone line within its Intelligence Section to his calls"".
Martin said the agent became implicated in 14 murders and the abductions of 15 individuals in crimes committed ""for and with"" the Provisional IRA.
""No amount of aggressive revisionist history from its supporters will ever erase their crimes against their own community,"" he said.
Martin said it is ""widely accepted"" that the Provisional IRA were ""responsible for over 1,700 deaths in Northern Ireland. They were a scourge on all communities, including those communities they falsely claimed to protect.""
Martin also called on Sinn Féin to apologise for ""the activities of the Provisional IRA as documented in this report"".
""It's long past time for that apology and renunciation of what happened, to occur,"" he said.
Responding to the Taoiseach, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald opened her remarks with an apology.
""To all those who have suffered such grievous loss, I am sorry for all the lives lost during the conflict and for the hurt and loss endured, without exception.
""Those words reflect a genuine sense of sorrow and regret for everyone who was hurt and harmed during those years of violence. By that I mean civilians, combatants and families whose lives were forever changed.""
McDonald said ""no debate, no report and no political process"" will ever fully address that ""human cost"".
She said findings from the Kenova report are ""stark and deeply disturbing"".
McDonald said collusion was ""not an aberration but defining feature of British state policy during the conflict"".
She said ""all families"" are entitled to truth and justice.
She also called on the Irish government to consider a ""full public inquiry"" into this ""British State activity in this jurisdiction"" as well as the Dublin Monaghan bombings and ""other killings of Irish citizens"".
She said the UK Legacy Act is ""designed to close down truth"" and not deliver it.
""The message is unmistakable - British state actors will not be pursued regardless of the dead. That is not the rule of law. That is impunity.""
The Sinn Féin leader said the question now is what will the Irish government accept as the controversial Legacy Act is finalised by the UK government.
A UK Government spokesperson said:""The Government is not yet in a position to formally respond to the request by Operation Kenova to name Stakeknife as there remains ongoing litigation, and consideration of the recent judgement in the Thompson Supreme Court case.
""The Secretary of State has committed to updating Parliament on the matter as soon as he is able to.""

","The mother of two young women who were badly injured in the New Year's Day fire in the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana has had a private encounter with the couple who own the bar.
Leila Micheloud had said earlier she wanted to ""speak privately"" to Jacques and Jessica Moretti, who were attending a hearing on the fire that left 41 people dead and 115 injured.
A lawyer for the victims' families, Sébastien Fanti, said it was ""an extremely intense moment and rare in its humanity"", without going into what was said.
During the hearing Jacques Moretti was questioned by lawyers for the families, and his wife was due to face further questions on Thursday.
Micheloud told reporters outside the hearing in the Swiss town of Sion that her presence showed that the victims were ""not just names on a list but they too had faces"".
She told Swiss TV earlier of the injuries her daughters had suffered, and that ""we must fight, keep on fighting every day"". Farah, 20, is still in hospital with burns on over 35% of her body.
Another mother, Laetitia Brodard-Sitre, lost her 16-year-on son Arthur in the disaster and said what was important was for the truth to come out.
""There must be no more lies,"" she told public broadcaster SRF. ""I want everyone to take responsibility; politics and parties don't matter to me.""
Jacques and Jessica Moretti are under criminal investigation for involuntary manslaughter, as well as bodily harm and arson through negligence. Neither is being held in custody; Mr Moretti was released on bail last month.
Micheloud's lawyer would not say what she had discussed with the Morettis, but described the encounter as an important moment in the process.
""There will be a time to say who is responsible for what. But there is also a time for humanity, to think of all the victims, of all the wounded,"" Fanti told reporters outside the hearing.
The Morettis' lawyer, Yaël Hayat, had earlier described the hearings in Sion as ""moments of truth"", insisting that neither was trying to shirk justice for their part in the tragedy at Le Constellation bar.
She told reporters that Micheloud had shown rare courage and humanity in approaching the couple: ""Maybe this moment will be, for both sides, a soothing moment in shared suffering.""
The Morettis have been criticised by several former employees for safety failings that have emerged since the fire.
Sparkling candles in champagne bottles have been blamed for setting light to the ceiling, and footage has emerged showing an employee using snooker cues to push sound-proofing foam back into place on the ceiling weeks before the disaster.
Many of the victims of the new year fire were teenagers - the ages of the dead ranging from 14 to 39. It has since emerged that a service door had been locked, preventing many of those inside the bar from getting out as the fire spread at about 01:30 on New Year's Day.
A month after the disaster, the death toll rose to 41 when an 18-year-old Swiss man died of his injuries.
No fire inspection had taken place there since 2019 and earlier this week, the former security officer at Crans-Montana's town hall told a hearing that local authorities had not closed any establishment there because of fire risks until last month.
He said he had only checked La Constellation twice - in 2018 and 2019 - and the acoustic foam on the ceiling, blamed for the fast spread of the fire, was not considered part of his fire safety examination.
Three days ago, one of the survivors of the fire, Mélanie Van de Velde, posted an open letter, describing the extent of her injuries and how her body had become ""a battlefield"", with 40% burns.
""Every time the dressings [on my wounds] are changed, every two days, is an ordeal. Every treatment revives the pain,"" she said on Facebook. ""My face will never be the same again... the one my daughter recognised is also gone.""
She also asked where justice was when responsibility had been left ""blurred, silent and diluted"".

UK will bolster troops in Norway to counter Russian threat,2026-02-11T11:54:23.159Z," Jessica Rawnsley
","The UK government has pledged to increase its military presence in Norway over the next three years, as part of efforts to combat Russian threats in the region.
Defence Secretary John Healey said the number of British troops stationed in Norway will increase from 1,000 to 2,000 personnel.
According to Healey, Moscow is ""rapidly re-establishing military presence in the region, including reopening old Cold War bases"".
His concern is echoed across Europe. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago, the continent has seen an increase in Kremlin aggression.
""Demands on defence are rising and Russia poses the greatest threat to Arctic and High North security that we have seen since the Cold War,"" Healey said.
The High North includes the Arctic circle and areas adjacent to it, it is a term used to describe the northernmost part of the globe.
The defence secretary will join his Nato counterparts at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the proposals.
The announcement comes weeks after a rift between European allies and Washington over Greenland, which is also in the Arctic.
US President Donald Trump had threatened to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, citing alleged threats from Russia and China. He has since appeared to back down from plans to annex Greenland.
The Arctic Sentry mission, proposed by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, aims to bolster surveillance and security in the region - modelled on existing Nato alliances such as the Baltic Sentry and the Eastern Sentry.
As part of the expanded presence in the region, 1,500 Royal Marine Commandos will take part in Nato's Exercise Cold Response in March. The large-scale drill across Norway, Finland and Sweden is designed to train allied forces in extreme Arctic conditions.
In September, the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force will conduct an exercise known as Lion Protector involving air, land and naval forces from several European nations.
The government says that operation will train armed forces to defend critical infrastructure against attacks and sabotage across Norway, Iceland and the Danish straits.
The UK and its Nato allies have become increasingly concerned about the risk Moscow poses to underwater cables and pipelines, amid heightened tensions following the invasion of Ukraine.
Last year, the UK and Norway signed a defence pact aimed at protecting undersea cables which will see the two nation's navies operate a combined fleet to track Russian submarines.
There has been a 30% rise in Russian submarines in UK waters over the past two years, according to the MoD.
The defence ministry has said Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic is now back to the same levels as the Cold War era.

Ireland launches world first scheme to provide basic income for artists,2026-02-11T11:26:50.410Z," Angus Harron
","Artists based in the Republic of Ireland could be paid €325 (£283) a week by the Irish government as part of a scheme to support them in their work.
The Basic Income for the Arts (BIA) project is believed to be the first permanent one of its kind in the world and Ireland's Culture Minister Patrick O'Donovan says it makes Ireland a ""global leader in the area of artist support"".
Some 2,000 eligible artists will be selected after applications open in May and will receive the weekly payment for three years.
The permanent scheme follows a pilot which was launched in 2022 to help the arts and culture sector recover after Covid-19.
O'Donovan said that every €1 (£0.87) invested in the pilot had generated €1.39 (£1.21) in return while allowing artists to devote more time to their work and improving their quality of life.
He said the permanent project was a ""major milestone"" that would ""sustain the careers"" of the artists selected and help ""retain their talent in the arts sector"".
""The pilot research has consistently demonstrated both the positive impact it has had on those in receipt of it and how difficult it is to work as an artist in Ireland given the income precarity prevalent in the sector"", he added.
""I encourage artists from all over the country to apply to ensure that those selected for the scheme represent the broadest range of artists practicing in Ireland today.""

Ireland's Department of Culture says 2,000 applicants will be selected using an ""anonymous randomised selection process"" to give every applicant ""an equal chance of selection"".
The department says detailed guidelines on applying will be published in April but that to be considered eligible artists must:
Be resident in Ireland when applying
Be a professional artist with a professional creative practice
Have a creative practice which is primarily based in Ireland
It says it expects to receive a ""high volume"" of applications and it ""will not be possible to provide funding to all eligible applicants"".
Those not selected in 2026 will be able to apply for the next scheme in 2029.

Campaigner 'devastated' over Donegal-Dublin flight changes,2026-02-10T18:48:24.832Z," Michael McBride
BBC News NI
","There has been criticism of the Irish government's decision to proceed with changes to the Donegal–Dublin flight route, despite campaigners' concerns that it could impact cancer patients travelling for medical appointments.
A new Public Service Obligation (PSO) contract announced on Tuesday removes afternoon flights in favour of a new schedule, and says the aircraft will no longer be based overnight in Donegal.
Mary Coyle from the charity Donegal Cancer Flights and Services, which helps organise flights for cancer patients, said she and fellow campaigners are ""devastated"".
The Department for Transport said it will ""closely monitor the performance of the new schedule"" over the next three months.
In a statement, a Department of Transport spokesperson confirmed the government-funded Donegal–Dublin air service has been awarded following a competitive tender process.
""This new contract demonstrates the government's continued commitment to maintaining vital connectivity to the northwest,"" the spokesperson said.
They said the service will provide twice-daily return flights between Donegal and Dublin, with onward international connections.
""The early morning flight departing from Donegal and the evening return from Dublin, which is relied on by many, including critical care patients, to ensure a daily round trip, will continue to be facilitated,"" the spokesperson said.
Under the new schedule, starting 29 March 2026, a same-day return service from Dublin will be available, and an evening departure from Donegal will replace the afternoon flight.
Speaking to BBC News NI on Tuesday, Mary Coyle said she was ""devastated"" and ""taken aback"" by the department's decision to proceed with changes to the route, despite what she described as ""widespread opposition"" to removing the afternoon flights in favour of a new schedule.
She said she and other campaigners still intend to travel to Dublin on Wednesday morning to deliver a petition, which they said has received 15,000 signatures, voicing opposition to the changes to Minister Darragh O'Brien.
Previously, Kathleen Griffin, who was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer, told BBC News NI the removal of the afternoon flight could force cancer patients into costly overnight stays or exhausting alternative journeys if they could no longer access same-day flights due to the timings of medical appointments.
Speaking to BBC News NI on Tuesday, Coyle said the people most impacted by this decision did not get the chance to meet with the minister and put forward their case.
""We have had no chance at all to be involved in the process,"" Coyle said.
""We are not happy about this at all and it just is another example of Donegal, the forgotten county, being let down once again.
""The route wasn't broken, it was running well, and many people who relied on it for medical appointments were able to benefit from it, but I think what this really shows is a real lack of compassion"".
She said the fact that many patients travelling from Donegal in the morning will be reliant on what she called a ""ghost flight"" with no passengers on board arriving from Dublin, which she believed ""would not be a priority for departure from Dublin Airport"".
Coyle said, despite the decision being already taken, they will go to Dublin on Wednesday and still voice their frustrations to department officials.
In a statement released by Donegal Airport, the airport said they were notified on Tuesday afternoon that the Department of Transport had executed ""a new contract for the Donegal–Dublin PSO route.""
Donegal Airport said it does not believe the new contract reflects ""the spirit"" of the original PSO.
""It does not maximise connectivity to the region,"" the statement added.
The airport also expressed serious concerns over the aircraft no longer staying overnight in Donegal, ""which was the case for the preceding 21 years"" and had given ""confidence to time-critical users of the certainty of departure on the morning flight"".
The board confirmed it is continuing to seek legal advice and expects to conclude its review in the coming days.
It said its priority remains providing services that meet the needs of passengers in Donegal and beyond.
The airport also thanked customers and the local community for what it described as strong support in recent days.
It added that once legal advice has been considered, the airport will decide on its next steps and communicate its position to both passengers and the Department of Transport.

French former teacher charged with abusing 89 teens dating back to 1960s,2026-02-10T17:16:52.287Z," Hugh Schofield
Paris correspondent
","An elderly French man has been charged with the rape and sexual assault of 89 teenagers in a mass abuse case that police allege spans many countries and dates back to the 1960s.
Jacques Leveugle, 79, who is in custody in south-east France, was arrested after his nephew found a USB that allegedly detailed his ""sexual relations"" with minors aged 13 to 17, the Grenoble prosecutor, Etienne Manteaux, told a news conference.
In an unusual move, authorities are naming the suspect because out of the 89 assaults, Manteaux said that only around 40 victims had been identified.
""If victims wish to come forward, now is the time,"" he added.
Police allege the crimes took place between 1967 and 2022.
Throughout much of his life, Leveugle worked as an informal teacher or assistant at holiday camps, the prosecutor said.
A timeline released of Leveugle's whereabouts dating back to the 1960s shows his appearance throughout the decades.
Police allege that he could have carried out assaults not only in France, but also Germany, Switzerland, Morocco, Niger, Algeria, the Philippines, India, Colombia, and the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.
""He travelled to these different countries and in each of these places where he settled to provide tutoring and teach, he would meet young people and have sexual relations with them,"" Manteaux told the news conference on Tuesday.

Leveugle was arrested in 2024 after visiting his brother in the Isère department around Grenoble, a city in south-eastern France. At the time, Leveugle was living in Morocco.
His brother's son - who had suspicions about his uncle - took advantage of his absence one day in October 2023 to examine a USB drive that belonged to Leveugle. It allegedly contained ""15 tomes of very dense material"" - photographs and written accounts of his ""sexual relations"" with minors, Manteaux said.
""The victims we have spoken to tell us that he spent a lot of time helping them to learn foreign languages, awakening their sense of culture... He has a complex personality,"" the prosecutor said.
""A lot of work has been done to identify all the victims. But in his journal, some only have first names, and there we found ourselves up against a wall. That's why we decided to launch this appeal - and also in case there are other victims not listed in his journal,"" Manteaux added.
The prosecutor revealed that under questioning, Leveugle also allegedly admitted to killing his own mother and aunt by smothering them with cushions.
He is accused of killing his mother in 1974 when she was in the terminal phase of cancer, and he allegedly did the same to his 92-year-old aunt in 1992.
""He explained to us that he told (his aunt) he had to leave for the Cévennes. She was pleading with him not to go, so he took the decision to kill her too,"" the prosecutor said.
""He justifies the killings by saying he hoped someone would do the same to him if he was in the same situation at the end of his life.""
A separate judicial investigation has been opened into these alleged killings.
Under French law, alleged assaults that took place before 1993 come under the country's statute of limitations, so no prosecutions for them would be possible. However Manteaux said it was still important to get a full picture of Leveugle's alleged crimes.
In two other recent and high-profile sexual assault cases in France, offenders kept records of their activities which were later key in bringing them to justice.
In the Pélicot rape case, Dominique Pélicot kept videos of men assaulting his sleeping wife Gisèle, whom he had drugged. He was jailed for 20 years.
In Brittany, former doctor Joêl Le Scouarnec compiled detailed computer records of the hundreds of children he molested in hospital. Without this evidence, he may never have been convicted. He, too, was jailed for 20 years.

Macron urges Europe to start acting like world power,2026-02-10T11:12:08.617Z," Hugh Schofield
Paris
","French President Emmanuel Macron has urged Europe to assert itself on the world stage, saying it is time to start acting like a ""power"".
In the face of growing threats from China, Russia and now the US, he told a group of European newspapers that the continent faced a ""wake-up call"".
""Are we ready to become a power? This is the question in the field of economy and finance, in defence and security, and in our democratic systems.
""In another era we might have said it is the moment to 'assume our majority',"" he said ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later this week.
Macron repeated his call for EU-wide mutualised loans in order to raise hundreds of billions of euros needed for industrial investment.
""The time has come to launch a shared debt capacity to fund our future expense - eurobonds for the future. We need big European programmes to finance the best projects,"" he said.
Similar calls in the past have met scepticism from Germany and other countries, who feel France wants to use Europe to bear a financial burden which it alone - because of its failure to reform - is unable to take up.
Macron admitted that France ""has never had a balanced model, unlike certain economies of the north, which are built more on a sense of responsibility.
""And we have never had reforms like the ones initiated in the 2010s in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece, which are paying dividends today.""
But he said there was growing demand in the world's financial markets for mutualised European debt, which currently the EU was not equipped to supply.
""The world markets are increasingly afraid of the American greenback [dollar]. They want alternatives…
""For investors everywhere a democratic state of law is a huge attraction. And when I look at the world as it is, we have the authoritarian regime that is China, and on the other side we have the US distancing itself further and further from a state of law.""
According to Macron, the 27-member EU needs €1,2tn (£1tn; $1.4tn) a year to invest in the vital sectors of security and defence, clean energy, and artificial intelligence.
Calling on the EU to ""protect"" these and other industries, he said: ""The Chinese do it, the Americans too. Europe today is the most open market in the world.
""In the face of that, I am not saying we should be protectionist. It's more a question of being coherent - in other words not imposing on our own producers rules which we do not impose on non-Europeans.""
""Today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder,"" he said.
""Climate change is accelerating. The US – which we thought would guarantee our security for ever – is no longer sure. Russia was to give us cheap energy for ever, but that stopped three years ago. China... has become a rival that gets fiercer and fiercer.
""Today, we Europeans are on our own. But we have each other. We are 450 million people. It's huge. For me [becoming a power] is the fulfilment of the European adventure.
""We came together to stop war, we came together to build a market. But we always forbade ourselves to think of power.""
Asked about the latest stand-off with Washington over Greenland, at the end of which US President Donald Trump appeared to back down from threats to annex the Danish territory, Macron said the Europeans should not be fooled.
""At the end of a crisis, there is a cowardly tendency to sit back and say 'phew'. There are threats and intimidation, and then suddenly Washington gives way. And people think it's over.
""Don't believe it for a single second,"" the French leader said.

Norway police investigate diplomat over Epstein links,2026-02-09T21:12:09.251Z," Tom McArthur
","Police in Norway have opened an investigation into a high-profile diplomat and her husband over their links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Mona Juul resigned as ambassador to Jordan and Iraq on Sunday, days after she was suspended following Norwegian media reports that each of her children would receive $5m (£3.6m) in a will allegedly signed by Epstein days before he died.
Emails released in the so-called Epstein files also appear to show that Juul's husband, Terje Rød-Larsen, had dinner with Epstein in Paris in June 2019, weeks before Epstein's arrest in the US on sex trafficking charges.
Juul's lawyer has said she ""does not recognise the accusations made against her"" and Rød-Larsen's lawyer said he is confident the investigation will clarify ""there is no basis for criminal liability"".
Appearing in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.
Norway's foreign ministry has said Juul's contact with Epstein revealed a ""serious lapse in judgement"".
An ""aggravated corruption"" inquiry has been launched by the Norwegian economic crime unit Økokrim, police announced on Monday.
""Økokrim will, among other things, investigate whether benefits were received in connection with her position,"" police said in a statement, referring to Juul.
A property in Oslo has been searched in connection with the investigation.
Juul and Rød-Larsen were part of a small group of diplomats that negotiated the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, which at the time were seen as a breakthrough in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
Norwegian media reports Rød-Larsen had extensive communication with Epstein and arranged to meet him with Juul more than once.
The wider Epstein documents, released by the US Department of Justice last month, contain millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into the late sex offender - who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.
Juul is the latest prominent public figure from the Nordic country to be drawn into the widening scandal surrounding the contents of the files, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit, former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland, and chief executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende.
Mette-Marit gave a ""profound apology"" to Norwegians for her friendship with Epstein, after it emerged they had exchanged messages for three years.
Jagland, who is also former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, is being investigated over his alleged links to Epstein. His lawyer said they would fully co-operate with the police probe.
The WEF ordered an independent review into Brende – who also served as the Norwegian foreign minister - over his interactions with the paedophile.
Brende has acknowledged dining with Epstein three times in 2018 and 2019 and communicating with him by email and text. He said he welcomes the WEF's decision to launch a review.
Correction 9 February: An earlier version of this article carried a picture of Danish politician Mona Juul, who is not the subject of this story.

Spanish train drivers to begin nationwide strike after fatal crashes,2026-02-09T03:00:05.733Z," Yang Tian
","Train drivers in Spain are due to begin a three-day nationwide strike on Monday in protest of what they say is a lack of safety guarantees on the country's rail system.
The action follows two fatal train crashes in January, one in Adamuz in the country's southern region which killed 46 people, and the second just two days later near Barcelona where a train driver died and dozens were injured.
The accidents have caused severe disruption for travellers and cast doubt on Spain's much-vaunted rail system.
Semaf, the train drivers' union, are demanding the hiring of more staff and increased investment and maintenance in what it has described as ""the constant deterioration of the rail network"".
Following the two collisions, subsequent safety checks also revealed faults and maintenance issues on a number of routes.
Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is due to be grilled in parliament later this week about the failures in the rail system.
The accident in Adamuz on 18 January, where a high-speed train derailed and collided with another travelling in the opposite direction was the country's worst rail disaster in more than a decade.
A preliminary report by rail accident investigation commission CIAF has found that grooves found on the wheels of the derailed train and three earlier trains suggests that a fracture in the track occurred before the train went over it.
Just two days later in Catalonia, a trainee driver was killed and at least 37 passengers were injured when a collapsed wall caused another local train to derail.
Rail officials believe the wall collapsed as the train was passing, striking the driver's cab first and then causing considerable damage to the first carriage of the train in which most of the injured passengers were travelling.
Semaf has previously said the collisions represent ""a turning point in demanding that all necessary actions be taken to guarantee the safety of railway operations"".
The amount of investment the rail network receives has come under particular scrutiny. The Socialist-led government has sought to dismiss such queries, pointing out that €700m (£605m) has been invested in updating the Madrid-Andalusia line in recent years, with the stretch of track where the accident took place included in that renovation.
""We're not looking at a problem of lack of maintenance, we're not looking at a problem of obsolete [infrastructure], and we're not looking at a problem of lack of investment,"" said Transport Minister Óscar Puente.

Italy says railways hit by 'serious sabotage' as Winter Olympics begin,2026-02-08T22:55:49.342Z," Rachel Muller-Heyndyk
","Suspected attacks on northern Italy's railway network have led to severe travel disruption in the region, the authorities say, as thousands gathered for the start of the Winter Olympic Games.
Police reported three separate incidents involving damage to railway lines that they believe are connected to the Games.
A fire hit rail infrastructure between Bologna and Venice, triggering delays of up to two-and-a-half hours, and police later found severed cables and an explosive device in locations nearby.
The Ministry of Transport called the incidents an act of ""serious sabotage"", which they said mirrored vandalism during the Paris Olympics in 2024.
Police said a track switch was set alight near Pesaro, on the Adriatic coast. Several hours later, police discovered severed electric cables near Bologna, along with a rudimentary explosive device left by a track nearby.
Bologna's rail station is a major transport hub, linking cities in the north and south, and east to west lines.
""These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy's image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling and positive,"" said Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini.
A police spokesperson earlier said that they were investigating the incidents and that no one had claimed responsibility.

Salvini compared the events to the Paris Summer Olympics, when saboteurs damaged France's high speed rail network.
""There are similarities in action and timing to the French incident,"" he told AFP.
Bologna's high speed, state-owned railway had to temporarily close, but traffic was returning to normal by Saturday afternoon.
The opening ceremony of the Games took place on Friday evening in Milan, in Cortina in northeastern Italy and two other locations.
Events are spread over hundreds of miles of northern Italy, in locations including the Alps and Dolomite mountains.

Correction 8 February: An earlier version of this article stated that Milan and Cortina were both reachable by train from Venice. Travelling from Venice to Cortina on public transport actually requires using both a train and a bus.

Centre-left candidate poised to comfortably win Portuguese presidency,2026-02-08T21:47:38.869Z," Ian Aikman
","Centre-left candidate António José Seguro is poised to comfortably beat his far-right rival to the Portuguese presidency after a run-off vote.
With 95% of votes counted, Seguro has won 66%, with the leader of the far-right Chega (Enough) party, André Ventura, trailing behind on 34%.
The two men went head-to-head in a campaign at times overshadowed by the deadly storms that has lashed the country in recent days.
Seguro, 63, had been backed by politicians on both sides of the aisle, with several conservative figures voicing support for the moderate socialist to see off his far-right opponent.
Thousands of self-declared ""non-socialists"" had signed an open letter backing Seguro for president, including former conservative ministers.
The former Socialist Party leader is now set to succeed the conservative Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa as president.
The role of president in Portugal is largely ceremonial, but it comes with some key powers – including the so-called ""atomic bomb"" ability to dissolve parliament and call snap elections in certain circumstances – as well as the power to veto legislation, though this can be overturned.
Despite his loss on Sunday, Ventura's position in second place reflects the rapid ascent of his party, which became the second largest in Portugal's parliament last year – just six years after Chega was formed in 2019.
Portugal's centre-right Prime Minister Luís Montenegro has previously denounced Ventura – a 43-year-old former football pundit – as ""xenophobic, racist and demagogic"".
But the prime minister chose not to support Seguro's run for president, instead declining to endorse either candidate.
Voting has been postponed in areas worst-hit by flooding from Storm Leonardo, which triggered mass evacuations in the Iberian Peninsula.

France murder trial complicated by twin brothers with same DNA,2026-02-08T17:49:51.540Z," Henri Astier
","Two identical twins on trial for murder in France have confounded attempts to determine which one pulled the trigger because they have the same DNA, French media report.
The 33-year-old brothers are among five defendants on trial near Paris, accused of a double murder and several subsequent attempted killings in 2020, according to reputable French newspaper Le Parisien.
It reports that both are suspected of conspiring to plot the double murder, but that DNA on an assault rifle used in one of the later gun battles could only be from one twin.
A police officer told the court that forensic experts were unable to tell which of the brothers had been conclusively implicated.
""Only their mother can tell them apart,"" one investigator is quoted as telling the court in Bobigny, north of the French capital.
There is reportedly a tense atmosphere in the court where the trial is taking place. On Tuesday, both twins were said to have been expelled from the courtroom for refusing to stand up.
Police believe they have taken advantage of their resemblance to cover their tracks. A senior officer quoted by Le Parisien said the pair frequently exchanged clothes, phones and identification documents.
Identical twins develop from a single fertilised egg that splits during pregnancy. Because they originate from the same egg and sperm, they share exactly the same DNA, making forensic identification extremely difficult.
With genetic data unable to distinguish between them, investigators relied on phone records, surveillance footage, wiretaps and efforts to corroborate their whereabouts and movements, according to Le Parisien.
But the crucial question of who fired the recovered weapon remains an open one.
The trial continues, with court due to reach a decision in late February.

Italian police arrest protesters after clash in Olympic host city Milan,2026-02-08T13:02:35.959Z," Kathryn Armstrong
","Six people have been arrested after police clashed with protesters in Milan, one of the host cities of the Winter Olympic Games, during the first day of the competition.
Thousands took to the streets in the northern Italian city on Saturday to protest against the Games and a range of issues including the cost of living. Some released fireworks and threw stones at police, who responded with water cannon.
It comes after the government tightened protest laws in the wake of a demonstration last weekend in Turin that left more than 100 officers injured, according to government figures.
Meanwhile, officials are investigating suspected sabotage on northern Italy's railway network on Saturday.
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said those protesting against the Olympics were the ""enemy of Italy"" and had put images of the demonstrations ""on the televisions of half the world"", while thousands of other Italians were working hard to make the competition a success.
She said this had happened ""after others locked railway cables to prevent trains from starting"".
Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini described those involved in confrontations in Milan as ""criminals"".
""Just days after the shameful violence in Turin, more clashes, more attacks on law enforcement,"" he said.
""We're proud to have pushed for a new security package that will allow for even more effective interventions against thugs and criminals.""
The Turin demonstration, which was called in response to the eviction of an unofficial social centre, started peacefully but later turned violent when armed groups confronted police. More than 30 people were arrested.
One officer was attacked with a hammer, which Meloni described as attempted murder.
A new security package, which was adopted on Thursday after being fast-tracked as a result of the violence in Turin, allows police to detain suspected troublemakers for up to 12 hours before demonstrations to stop them from spreading unrest. Critics have called it repressive.
Most of those involved in Saturday's protest in Milan marched peacefully. One woman, Francesca Missana, told news agency AFP that the Olympic Games were ""no longer sustainable from an environmental or a social point of view, their time is up"".
""These Games were promoted as sustainable and cost-neutral,"" protest organiser Alberto di Monte told AFP. He added that because the Games were spread across multiple sites, and that billions had been spent on roads instead of protecting the mountains.
Saturday also saw chaos on some of Italy's northern rail networks, with suspected attacks delaying people for hours.
A fire hit rail infrastructure between Bologna and Venice, and police later found severed cables and an explosive device in locations nearby.
Police said a track switch was set alight near Pesaro on the Adriatic coast and electric cables were found severed near Bologna, along with a rudimentary explosive device left by a track.
Bologna's central rail station is a major hub, linking cities in the north and south, and east to west lines.
RFI, which owns the country's railways, said services have since returned to normal.
The transport ministry described the incidents as ""suspected sabotage"" and said they mirrored vandalism at the start of the Paris Olympics in 2024.
""These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy's image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling,"" Salvini, who is also Italy's transport minister, said on Saturday.
The Winter Olympics are taking place until 22 February in a number of locations, from Milan to the resort town of Cortina d'Ampezzo, the Dolomite regions of Predazzo and Tesero, and the Alpine resorts of Livigno and Bormio.

France investigates ex-minister Jack Lang over Epstein links,2026-02-07T18:10:55.125Z," Henri Astier
","Financial crime prosecutors in France say they have opened a preliminary inquiry into former Culture Minister Jack Lang over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.
Lang, a major figure in French socialist governments between the 1980s and 2000s, is being investigated for suspected ""laundering of tax fraud proceeds"".
It follows the US Department of Justice's release of the Epstein files, which have documented links between the Lang family and the late American sex offender.
Lang, now 86, denies wrongdoing and on Saturday described the allegations against him as ""baseless"".
He told AFP the investigation ""will bring much light on to the accusations that are questioning my probity and my honour"".
Hours after the investigation was announced, Lang offered to resign as head of the Arab World Institute, a body that promotes cooperation and exchanges between France and Arab nations.
In a letter to Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, seen by AFP, Lang said he would submit his resignation at the next board meeting.
The former French minister, who is named almost 700 times in the Epstein files, had until now resisted pressure to step down.
Barrot, who had summoned Lang for talks on Sunday, said he had acknowledged the resignation offer and planned to start the process of looking for a successor.
Lang's daughter Caroline, 64, is also being investigated in the case. Earlier this week she stepped down as head of a French film producers' union.
On Tuesday, he told broadcaster BFMTV he had known nothing about Epstein's crimes when he met him ""some 15 years ago"". The US financier was convicted in Florida in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution.
Lang - who served as culture minister between 1981 and 1993 and later as minister of education - says he was introduced to Epstein by US actor-director Woody Allen.
He said he had found Epstein ""passionate about art, culture and cinema"".
In a separate interview on Tuesday, he told RTL radio that Epstein had been ""generous"" and ""courteous"", adding: ""When I meet people I don't ask to see their criminal record.""
Details from the files revealed by French media suggest Lang appealed to Epstein for funds or favours on several occasions - including the use of Epstein's car and private plane for himself and his family.
Caroline Lang told French news website Mediapart that she met Epstein in 2012, when he told her he wanted to ""invest in young French and international artists"".
She said his lawyers had set up a company, Prytanee LLC, based in the US Virgin Islands. Mediapart said Caroline Lang had received half of the shares, but she said she had not invested in it or received any funds from it.
An email in the Epstein files suggested she contributed her art knowledge, Mediapart reports. She told the website she had been ""incredibly naive"".
Resigning from her post in the Independent Production Union, she said: ""I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union.""
The files do not suggest either Lang or his daughter were implicated in Epstein's sexual crimes.
The latest release of Epstein files by the US government - which include millions of documents - include the names of rich and powerful people from around the world. Being mentioned does not imply wrongdoing.
Epstein died in prison in New York in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

"General shot in Moscow conscious after surgery, Russian media say",2026-02-07T16:10:31.377Z," Ian Aikman
","A Russian general who was shot several times in Moscow on Friday has regained consciousness after successfully undergoing surgery, according to reports in Russian media.
Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, who is Russia's deputy head of military intelligence, was rushed to hospital in serious condition on Friday morning after the attack in the north-western outskirts of the capital.
Two suspects have reportedly been arrested and will soon be taken in for questioning.
Russian officials have blamed Kyiv for the shooting, but Ukraine's foreign minister denied involvement, according to Reuters.
Doctors said on Saturday it can be ""cautiously stated that the threat to [Alexeyev's] life has passed"", Russia's state news agency Tass has reported.
The highly decorated general was ambushed on the landing inside his apartment block, where a gunman inflicted three bullet wounds, a source close to the investigation told the Kommersant newspaper.
He was reportedly hit in the chest or abdomen before the attacker and an accomplice fled the scene.
A neighbour in the building on Volokolamsk Highway told Reuters she had been woken by the sound of ""several"" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.
Alexeyev was taken to a Moscow hospital with injuries where he reportedly underwent successful surgery.
""Afterwards, Alexeyev was placed in a medically induced coma. He has now regained consciousness. At this point, it can be cautiously stated that the threat to his life has passed,"" medical sources said, according to Tass.
Investigators on Friday said they had opened a criminal case for attempted murder.
Two suspects will be taken for questioning and a court hearing could take place on Sunday to determine their pretrial detention, Kommersant reported.
Alexeyev, 64, is the latest high-ranking military figure to be targeted near Moscow since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
As number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence, he has played a significant role in the war in Ukraine and was previously awarded the Hero of Russia title for his part in Moscow's military intervention in the Syrian civil war.
He was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.
He was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.
His boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team at peace talks with Ukrainian and US teams in Abu Dhabi. The latest round ended on Thursday without a major breakthrough.
No-one has so far claimed Friday's attack, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to point the finger at Ukraine, saying it was an attempt at ""disrupting the negotiation process"".
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha told Reuters that Kyiv had nothing to do with Friday's shooting.
Kyiv has claimed responsibility for some attacks on Russian military figures in the past.
An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time it was behind the attack.
Another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow in December. Ukraine did not comment at the time.
Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that the US had proposed talks between negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv for the first time on American soil, ""probably in Miami"".
He added that the US wants the war to end by June. There was no immediate comment from Washington or Moscow.
"
"US wants Russia and Ukraine to end war by June, says Zelensky",2026-02-07T14:05:01.723Z," Kathryn Armstrong
","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, adding both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week.
""America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams – Ukraine and Russia – meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation,"" he said.
There was no immediate comment from Washington or Moscow, but US President Donald Trump has been pushing for an end for the conflict since he took office again more than a year ago.
Meanwhile, Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure - causing further widespread blackouts during freezing conditions.
In comments released on Saturday, Zelensky told reporters what had taken place during the second round of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi, which ended on Friday with no reports of a breakthrough.
Zelensky said ""difficult issues remained difficult"", including territorial concessions that Ukraine is under pressure to make.
He said the parties discussed, for the first time, the possibility of a trilateral meeting between leaders, not simply representatives, but cautioned ""preparatory elements are needed for this"".
Asked whether a time frame had been given for an agreement, the Ukrainian leader replied: ""The Americans say that they want to do everything by June.""
""Why before this summer?"" he added. ""We understand that their domestic issues in the US will have an impact."" These issues include the November midterm elections, which could affect the balance of power in the US government.
As the diplomacy continues, so too are Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities.
""Russian criminals carried out another massive attack on Ukraine's energy facilities,"" Ukraine's energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote on Telegram.
Substations, which control the flow of electricity, and overhead power lines that ""form the backbone of Ukraine's power grid"" were targeted, Shmyhal said. Power plants were also struck.
Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said ""the power deficit in the power system of Ukraine significantly increased"" as a result of the latest attacks.
Shmyhal said neighbouring Poland had been asked for emergency power supplies.
Zelensky wrote on social media that Friday night's attack involved more than 400 drones and 40 missiles. Air-defence systems intercepted most, but not all, of them, the Ukrainian military said.
""The main targets were the energy grid, generation facilities, and distribution substations,"" he said, adding that damage had been reported in at least four regions.
In the western region of Lviv, the Dobrotvir power plant came under attack, leaving thousands of people without electricity, according to the regional head, Maksym Kozytskyi.
At least 6,000 people were without power as a result of hourly power outage schedules, he added.
The Burshtyn power plant was also struck in the nearby Ivano-Frankivsk region.
DTEK, which runs both the Dobrotvir and Burshtyn plants said it was the tenth ""massive attack"" on its power plants since October 2025.
""In total, DTEK thermal power plants have been attacked by the enemy more than 220 times since the beginning of the full-scale invasion,"" the company added on Telegram. This was launched by Russia nearly four years ago.
One person was reported dead in the Rivne region and several were injured in Zaporizhzhia. Rivne's head, Oleksandr Koval, said there was also damage to homes and ""critical infrastructure"".
In Kyiv, residents once again took shelter in metro stations. Among them, Oksana Kykhtenko, told the Reuters news agency: ""They [Russians] make us live in inhumane conditions. Without heating, without electricity.""
A drone strike in the city of Yahotyn, about 10km (6.2 miles) away, caused a fire at a warehouse complex, the Ukrainian emergency services said.
Ukraine has also attacked Russia, striking a factory that makes missile fuel components in the western Tver region, according to media reports quoting Ukrainian security officials.
Further south, in the Saratov region, an oil depot was also hit, Ukraine said.
Russia has not commented on any of the latest attacks.
Moscow renewed its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Monday after a pause US President Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe due to the fierce cold in Ukraine. Trump said the pause lasted for a week until last Sunday but Kyiv disputed the timeline.
DTEK said the combined missile and drone strikes caused ""the most powerful blow"" to infrastructure so far this year.
""Moscow must be deprived of the ability to use the cold as leverage against Ukraine,"" Zelensky wrote on X on Saturday, responding to the latest strikes.
Russia has also accused Kyiv of not being serious about securing a lasting peace. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday blamed Ukraine for the shooting of a high-profile general in Russia's military, saying it was aimed at ""disrupting the negotiation process"".
It is not yet known who was behind the shooting.
Some 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zelensky said earlier this week. The BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine.

Norway's crown princess apologises after pressure over Epstein friendship,2026-02-06T21:34:24.148Z," Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor
","Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit has given a ""profound apology"" to Norwegians for her friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after it emerged they had exchanged messages for three years.
""I also apologise for the situation in which I have placed the Royal House, especially the King and Queen,"" she said in a palace statement after days of mounting pressure to address the issue.
Harald V and Queen Sonja, who are both 88, have not commented on the revelations.
The King met Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre on Friday, alongside Crown Prince Haakon, who told reporters later that his wife wanted to speak: ""But right now she can't, and I also tell her she is not allowed to.""
Hundreds of emails from 2011-14 involving Epstein and the crown princess came to light in the cache of files published by the US justice department a week ago.
Some of the exchanges apparently involve plans to meet in person, and reveal she spent four days at Epstein's Palm Beach house in Florida while he was not there.
The warm nature of the correspondence has come as a shock to Norwegians, and she appears to have been aware he had already served a jail term in 2008: ""Googled u after last email,"" she wrote in October 2011. ""Agree didn't look too good.""
Although an initial statement was released last Saturday, in which the crown princess expressed regret and admitted ""poor judgement"", the palace had been pressed to provide further details of how well she knew Epstein.
In a statement on Friday, the palace said the crown princess was deeply saddened that she had failed to realise early enough what kind of person he was.
She wanted to provide a more detailed explanation but was in a ""very difficult situation"" and needed time to ""gather herself"".
""It is important for me to say I am sorry to all those I have disappointed. Some of the content in the messages between Epstein and me does not represent the person I want to be.""
Mette-Marit already had a four-year-old boy, Marius Borg Høiby, from an earlier brief relationship when she married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon in 2001.
Her first child Marius Borg Høiby is now 29 and at the centre of a high-profile seven-week trial which began this week. He faces 38 charges, including four counts of rape which he denies.
Although neither part of the royal family nor a public figure, he has grown up within his step-father Crown Prince Haakon's family, alongside half-sister Princess Ingrid Alexander and half-brother Prince Sverre Magnus.
His mother has not commented on the trial but Crown Prince Haakon told reporters in Oslo there was a lot going on in his family and the most important thing in the past few days ""has been to take care of the flock"".
""We support Marius in the situation he is in. We look after the other children as well... They also need to be cared for, and I have to make sure to take care of the crown princess,"" he said.
Mette-Marit is also extremely unwell with pulmonary fibrosis and her doctors are preparing to put her on a list for a lung transplant.
Giving evidence in court on Wednesday, her son initially struggled to compose himself, holding back tears as he complained of being ""hassled"" by the press since he was three years old.
If found guilty by the three judges at Oslo district court, he could face a jail term of at least 10 years. Two days before the trial began, he was arrested for a fourth time on Sunday, on suspicion of assault, wielding a knife and violating a restraining order.
His half-sister Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 22, was also critical of the press in a post to almost 800 followers on a private Instagram account this week.
In lengthy comments seen by public broadcaster NRK, Aftenposten and VG website, the princess, who is second in line to the Norwegian throne after her father, said it was important ""not to make claims you have no basis for"".
While stressing she was not referring to anything in particular - ""not Marius, not mum or dad or Magnus. It's about personal attacks, it can apply to anyone, but I chose to post this here because I'm going crazy. Enough is enough"".
When approached by the BBC, the palace said it did not wish to comment on the matter.

Ukrainian mother's joy after phone call with son she thought had been killed,2026-02-06T18:17:39.567Z," Sarah Rainsford
Eastern Europe correspondent in Kyiv
","Nazar Daletskyi's family were sure the soldier had been killed in action.
In 2023, they'd buried his body in the village cemetery, in western Ukraine.
But Nazar has just phoned his mother, weakened and exhausted - but very much alive.
He's been released from Russian captivity in the latest prisoner swap.
""My emotions were so strong,"" the soldier's mother Nataliya told the BBC, still reeling from the shock.
The joy of all the family at that first call, captured on video, is overwhelming.
Nataliya asks her son whether he's intact, ""You have your arms, your legs, everything?"" she wants to know.
""My golden child, I have been waiting for you so long.""
Nazar's cousin, Roksolana, is screaming and jumping for joy in the background.
""It was so strange, because my son had died, I buried him, but here's his voice. Can you imagine the emotions of a mother? Happiness. Great happiness. I could not hold back my tears,"" Nataliya said.
The full story of Nazar's return from the grave is extraordinary, especially in a country at war where good news is precious.
When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Nazar - who was 42 then - went straight back to the front: he'd already fought in 2014, so he was experienced.
""He didn't have any doubt. He went immediately,"" his cousin told the BBC.
But in May that first year, Nazar went missing in action.
His mother then got a call from a man speaking Russian who said Nazar had been captured, but ""everything will be fine"".
The mystery voice didn't say where Nazar was, who was holding him - or whether he was injured. The family had no idea whether to believe him - and they got no official news.
That was until a year later, when Nataliya was informed that a body had been identified in a morgue in south-eastern Ukraine, using a sample of DNA she had given.
""The body was badly burned. They had several that they found in a burned bus. When they started looking at the lists of missing soldiers, the data matched,"" Roksolana explains.
""They identified this body as Nazar.""
So the family received the body, held a funeral and they grieved.
Then last September they got the biggest shock of all.
A soldier, just released by Russia, called to tell them Nazar was alive. He had seen him in jail.
""We were shocked, it was so hard to believe. But why would he lie?"" Roksolana remembers how it felt.
Still, without speaking to Nazar or seeing him, they couldn't be sure.
Then this week, he called - back on Ukrainian soil.
Nataliya's son had been gone for three years and nine months.
As they wait for their big reunion, the family have been trying to remove material about Nazar's funeral from social media, not to upset him.
They also had to get his photograph taken down from a display of fallen heroes in the village.
There's now an investigation to understand how such a distressing mistake was made.
But for the moment, the family have other things to focus on.
Nazar's mother is preparing all his favourite homemade food, for when he's recovered a bit and ready to come home.
""I just want more positive outcomes like ours, for other families to get calls and for people to come home,"" Roksolana says.
Some 70,000 people are officially missing here, most thought to be soldiers. Some will have been killed on the battlefield, their bodies impossible to recover.
But many have been taken prisoner and, for their families, Nazar's story will be a glimmer of hope.
""I wish all women, mothers, children get a call like we had - and this happiness,"" Nataliya says.
""I'm just waiting for my son now, to hug him so tightly. I love him very much.""

Suspected Chinese spies arrested in quiet French town,2026-02-06T17:18:13.190Z," Hugh Schofield
Paris correspondent
","Two suspected Chinese spies, accused of using a sleepy village in south-western France to gather information, have been arrested.
Residents of Camblanes-et-Meynac, about 15km (9 miles) from Bordeaux, grew suspicious when - after letting a house through rentals giant Airbnb - the Chinese pair erected a large parabolic antenna in the garden.
The dish was directed at the sky and locals noticed that its installation coincided with a spate of cuts to their own internet service.
Intelligence experts believe south-western France is being increasingly targeted by Chinese and other espionage because of the region's proximity to defence, aerospace and telecommunication sites.
Last Saturday, officers from France's General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI) agency raided the house and seized a large quantity of computer equipment.
The men - Chinese nationals aged 27 and 29 - were questioned at DGSI headquarters in the suburbs of France's capital Paris, and have now been charged with ""delivering information to a foreign power... likely to damage the interests [of France]"".
They are being held in custody.
The prosecutor's office said the men had arrived in France last month under work visas which said they were engineers at a company specialising in wireless communications.
Two other men of Chinese origin, but living in France, have been charged with providing assistance.
According to the prosecutor's office, the suspected spies were trying to ""capture satellite data from [X owner Elon Musk's] Starlink network, as well as data from vital entities, notably military, in order to retransmit them to their country of origin, China"".
It is not the first time suspected Chinese spies have been caught in south-western France.
Last summer, a 51-year-old Chinese engineer was detained in the village of Boulogne-sur-Gesse, about 40 miles south-west of Toulouse. She had also installed a satellite dish and was suspected of trying to intercept signals from the Issus-Aussaguel ground station in the Toulouse suburbs.
Meanwhile, in December, a mathematics researcher at the University of Bordeaux's Institute of Mechanics and Engineering was placed under judicial investigation for ""providing information to a foreign power"" after he allegedly allowed members of a Chinese delegation into a restricted area.
""We do not know precisely what the pair at Camblanes-et-Meynac were up to, but the list of potential targets in the south-west of France is very large,"" said Jeremy André, an expert in Asian espionage at Intelligence Online.
In addition to Issus-Aussaguel - which communicates with satellites used by the French military and intelligence - there is a major airbase at Bordeaux-Mérignac. Defence industries like Airbus, Thales and Dassault all have installations in the area.
""Since World War One, the south-west has been a vital zone for French defence research,"" André said. ""The idea was to focus activity as far as possible from the frontline, and then it stayed.""
He continued: ""We know that the Chinese have spent a lot of energy developing co-operation with towns and other collectivities in the south-west, via legitimate diplomatic and economic channels.
""In itself, there's nothing wrong with that, but in doing so they create a tissue of links which can be activated on demand.""
According to intelligence experts, French authorities have recently decided to take cases like this to court. Previously, they would have chosen to deal with them covertly, suggesting a greater determination to publicise the espionage threat from China.
In Camblanes-et-Meynac, locals were bemused by the story.
""Here we tend to get artists, not spies,"" said Mayor Jean-Philippe Guillemeot. ""Maybe they just wanted somewhere nice and quiet.""

Russian general shot several times in Moscow,2026-02-06T16:39:38.842Z," Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor
","A high-profile general in Russia's military has been shot several times and wounded in Moscow.
Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of the capital, and is believed to be in a serious condition. The attacker fled the scene.
Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
No-one has so far claimed the attack, but senior Russian officials immediately blamed Ukraine, saying it was trying to derail negotiations to end the war.
""The victim has been taken to one of the city's hospitals,"" said Svetlana Petrenko of Russia's Investigations Committee (SK), which said it opened a criminal case for attempted murder.
Investigators are searching CCTV footage for clues and began interviewing potential witnesses of the attack on Friday morning on Volokolamsk Highway.
A neighbour of Alexeyev told the Reuters news agency she had been woken by the sound of ""several"" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.
""This is all I heard. Other neighbours rushed out, too. They asked how they could help, should they call ambulance and police, but she had already called them.""
Alexeyev has played a significant role during the war in Ukraine, taking part in talks with Ukraine during the Russian siege of the city of Mariupol in 2022.
Earlier he was awarded the title Hero of Russia for the role he played in Moscow's military intervention in Syria's civil war.
He was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.
He was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.
His boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team at peace talks with Ukrainian and US teams in Abu Dhabi. The latest round ended on Thursday without a major breakthrough.
It is not yet known who was behind the shooting - but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to accuse Ukraine.
He said ""this terrorist act"" was aimed at ""disrupting the negotiation process"".
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin was being briefed on the shooting. ""We wish first of all that the general survives and recovers. We hope that will be the case,"" Peskov told reporters.
Ukraine has not commented but has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past. Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.
An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time it was behind the attack.
Lt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection troops.
In December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to Russia's SK.

Further 22 infant human remains recovered from Tuam site,2026-02-06T12:54:10.099Z,No Author Listed,"An additional 22 sets of infant human remains have been recovered from the site of the former institution for unmarried mothers and their children in Tuam in County Galway.
This brings the total number of human remains recovered to 33.
The institution at Tuam came to international attention in 2014, after local historian Catherine Corless discovered there were 796 death certificates for children and babies who died there, but no burial records.
Hand excavation has continued under an area identified in historical documents as a ""burial ground"".
To date, all remains recovered from this area are of infants that were buried in coffins.
Forensic analysis is underway.
All were buried there during the period that the home operated in Tuam, between 1925 and 1961.
The Office of the Director of Authorised Intervention in Tuam (ODAIT) also uncovered a pit (over three metres in width; depth will be determined on excavation) which disturbed the ""burial ground"".
It contains modern building debris consistent with the post-institutional era.
In an update on Friday, the ODAIT said the latest evidence uncovered related to the period from 29 November 2025 to 28 January 2026.
In the former yard area, the entire area is now forensically resolved (shown in blue) apart from the well shaft and connected drains where work continues.
The ODAIT said a total of 28 DNA samples have been taken from relatives of those who died in the home.
To date, over 65 cases are being processed for determination of eligibility, with arrangements being made to take their samples in the coming weeks.
The institution at Tuam was owned by Galway County Council and run by a religious order, the Bon Secours Sisters.
The order has previously acknowledged that children and infants were ""buried in a disrespectful and unacceptable way"", and apologised.
It has contributed £2.14m towards the cost of the excavation.
Galway County Council also apologised for ""failing mothers and children"" after the inquiry report in 2021.
The excavation is expected to continue until 2027, with follow-up work expected to last several more years.

Norway investigates former PM Jagland over alleged Epstein links,2026-02-05T23:39:48.808Z," Jaroslav Lukiv
","Police in Norway have opened a corruption investigation into the country's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland over his alleged links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
A special Norwegian police unit which is analysing newly released Epstein files in the US said the 75-year-old was suspected of ""aggravated corruption"".
Police said they had already asked the country's foreign ministry to lift his immunity, which he enjoys because of his past role as a senior foreign diplomat.
Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent 10 years as secretary general of the Council of Europe.
His lawyer said they would fully co-operate with the investigation.
Pål K. Lønseth, head of Økokrim - the economic crime unit investigating Jagland - said: ""We consider there are reasonable grounds for investigation, given that he held the positions of chair of the Nobel Committee and Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the period covered by the released documents.
""Among other things, Økokrim will investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position.""
The police added that further details would be given ""at a later stage"".
Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said it was ""important that the facts of this case are brought to light"".
He added that Oslo would ask the Council of Europe for Jagland's immunity to be revoked.
Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet welcomed the opening of the investigation.
""Based on what we have found so far, we are confident of the outcome,"" he told Reuters news agency.
Separately, Brosveet told Norway's VG news site that he and his client would submit ""the key findings and documentation we have to Økokrim as soon as practically possible"".
Jagland was Norway's prime minister in 1996-97, and the secretary general of the Council of Europe in 2009-19.
He also chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2009-15.

The Bus Éireann operated vehicle is believed to have driven onto a pedestrianised street - North Earl Street, not far from O'Connell Street.
A number of people were trapped under the bus and emergency services had to rescue pedestrians. One of those in hospital is understood to have significant injuries.
Bus Éireann said they are offering full support to the authorities as their ""investigations continue and will provide any additional assistance required"".
Emergency services have now left the scene in Dublin city centre, but Gardaí (Irish police) remain and have cordoned off the area which is right beside the capital's famous Spire.
The man was pronounced dead at the scene.
A second man, aged in his 20s, is being treated in hospital for serious but non-life-threatening injuries.
The driver of the bus, a woman in her 50s, and a female pedestrian in her 30s are being treated in hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.
Restrictions are in place around the scene, which has been preserved for examination, and local traffic and pedestrian diversions are in place.
Jean O'Sullivan, CEO of Bus Éireann, said the company are ""profoundly saddened by this tragic incident"".
""On behalf of everyone at Bus Éireann, I extend our deepest condolences to the family of the deceased, and our thoughts are with all those affected at this very difficult time.""
Speaking in Dáil Éireann (lower house of parliament) on Thursday afternoon, Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan said his thoughts were with the family of the person who had been killed.
A spokesperson for the bus operator said the ""vehicle was not in service at the time of the incident"".
""Emergency services and Bus Éireann personnel attended the scene. Bus Éireann is offering its full support to the relevant authorities and will provide any additional assistance required,"" the spokesperson said.
Dublin Fire Brigade asked people to avoid the area.
Luas Green Line services have been suspended between Parnell Street and St Stephen's Green following the incident.
Speaking at the scene, Dublin Lord Mayor Ray McAdam offered his condolences to the family of the victim, adding: ""My thoughts and prayers to the three injured and their families as well.""
""I think Dubliners are shell-shocked, saddened by what has happened, in what is an awfully distressing incident. There is already a palpable sense of grief,"" he said.
Sinn Féin leader and Dublin Central TD Mary Lou McDonald said she was ""devastated to learn of this terrible incident in the heart of our city"".
""My thoughts are with the family of the deceased and all of the people who were struck or caught up in this collision, with their families, friends, and loved ones, and with everyone affected by what must be a very frightening experience,"" McDonald said.
Social Democrats TD for Dublin Central Gary Gannon said his thoughts were with the victims and their loved ones.
""This is a shocking and tragic incident which has rocked our community. I wish all those who are injured a speedy recovery,"" Gannon said.
""For those in the city, please avoid the area and give emergency services the room to work. It's essential during this time to follow guidance through official channels and reliable news sources.""

Louvre Museum crown left crushed but 'intact' after raid,2026-02-05T18:19:53.537Z," Alex Kleiderman
","The crown of French Empress Eugenie was left crushed after being dropped by fleeing thieves during the raid at the Louvre last October - but is ""nearly intact"" and can be fully restored, the museum has said.
Raiders stole an estimated 88 million euros (£76m, $104m) in jewels, but left the diamond-studded headpiece belonging to the wife of Napoleon III on their escape route.
The museum has issued the first photographs of the crown since the theft, saying it had been left ""badly deformed"" after the thieves tried to remove it through a narrow hole they sawed in its glass display case.
The crown is missing one of eight golden eagles that adorned it but retains its 56 emeralds and all but 10 of its 1,354 diamonds.
It added the 19th Century crown would be restored to its original state ""without the need for reconstruction"".
An expert committee led by the museum's president Laurence des Cars had been selected to supervise the restoration.
The heist took place on 19 October and saw the gang use a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.
Two of the thieves got inside by cutting through the window with power tools. They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the area, and cut through the glass of two display cases housing jewellery that once belonged to French royalty or its imperial rulers.
Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for less than four minutes before making their escape on two scooters waiting outside.
Police have arrested four male suspects who prosecutors allege are the thieves - but the mastermind behind the raid has not been tracked down.
The seven other items of jewellery taken, including a diamond-studded tiara that belonged to Eugenie and necklaces, ear-rings and brooches remain missing.

Russia and Ukraine exchange prisoners as peace talks end without breakthrough,2026-02-05T17:21:57.019Z," Jaroslav Lukiv
","Ukraine and Russia have conducted a rare exchange of prisoners of war and civilians after two days of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi.
A total of 157 Ukrainians - seven of them civilians - and 157 Russian soldiers were returned home in the first such swap in four months.
Russian, Ukrainian and US teams took part in the talks in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, with the main sticking points believed to be territorial concessions Ukraine is under pressure to make and security guarantees for it to prevent further Russian attacks if a deal is agreed to end the four-year war.
No breakthrough has been reported. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the talks had not been easy and he wanted ""faster results"".
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
In a post on social media, Zelensky wrote that Thursday's prisoner exchange ""took place after a long pause"" - referring to the previous such swap last October.
""We are returning our people home - 157 Ukrainians. Soldiers of the Armed Forces, National Guard, State Border Service. And civilians are also returning with the defenders,"" the Ukrainian president said, pledging to bring back every single Ukrainian still in Russian captivity.
Ukrainians officials said 139 had been in Russian captivity since 2022.
Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said 157 of its POWs were returned by Kyiv.
The ministry added that three Russian civilians ""illegally held"" were also handed back. They were residents of the western Kursk region, parts of which were occupied by Ukraine during its incursion in 2024-25.
The talks in Abu Dhabi - the second round in recent weeks - are part of US President Donald Trump's efforts to end the war.
Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner have been leading the negotiations.
The talks had been ""detailed and productive"", Witkoff wrote on X, but added that ""significant work remains"".
The most difficult issue is territory, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cedes the rest of the eastern industrial region of Donbas that Moscow does not currently control.
Another key sticking point is believed to be Kyiv's demand to get robust security guarantees from its European allies and the US.
No details have been released.
The trilateral talks began as Russia renewed its deadly attacks on Ukraine after a week-long pause that Trump had asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.
Moscow has been targeting the country's energy sector, leaving thousands of people without electricity, heating and water in freezing temperatures.

Fears flight route changes could affect cancer patients,2026-02-05T14:51:01.208Z," Mike McBrideandCharlie Joe McGinley
BBC News NI
","A Donegal woman who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer has expressed concern over potential changes to a flight route that she and other cancer patients rely on to access vital medical treatment in Dublin.
The twice-daily Donegal–Dublin flight is funded under a public service obligation (PSO), a government-subsidy for a service that would not otherwise be commercially viable.
The PSO contract is due for renewal on 25 February and there are growing fears proposed timetable changes could see the afternoon return flight cut.
Kathleen Griffin warned the changes could force cancer patients into costly overnight stays or exhausting alternative journeys if they could no longer access same-day flights.
The route has operated since 2004, with an early morning departure to Dublin and an afternoon service returning to the west Donegal airport later that same day.
Emerald Airlines, which is a regional service operated by Irish carrier Aer Lingus, is the current provider of the PSO route.
In a statement, the Department for Transport in the Republic of Ireland said a new procurement process was ""underway in line with EU regulations to ensure continuity of services"".
""As the tender process is still ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further on the new flight schedule at this time,"" a spokesperson said.
Mary Coyle, who is from the charity Donegal Cancer Flights & Services, which helps organise the flights for cancer patients, said the proposed draft flight schedule with no afternoon return flight could force patients to pay higher amounts for accommodation if same-day medical travel was no longer possible.
Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle's Mark Patterson Show, Coyle said the charity had more than 500 clients, many of whom relied on the flight service to access specialised medical treatments not available in Donegal or surrounding areas.
""It's not just cancer patients we cater for, but there are also patients going for kidney transplants, and we also have children with life-long or life-limiting conditions,"" she said.
She added that the charity was unable to book any flights past 25 February due to the uncertainty surrounding the flight route schedule.
Coyle said the charity worked closely with oncology departments in hospitals to coordinate appointments, ensuring people from Donegal could get earlier slots in the day and return home in time for their flights.
""We have a car and a bus, but we already use those for transporting patients to Galway, Roscommon, Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, Ballykelly, and Letterkenny, so that service is already stretched as we are a voluntary service with limited funding,"" she continued.
""These flights are a lifeline for patients going through enough, and financially stretched as they are.""
Kathleen Griffin said she had travelled to Dublin by air six times using the Donegal flight service.
""I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer three years ago and had chemotherapy, and now it's all follow-ups to make sure that it doesn't return,"" she said.
""I'm nearly finished with my treatment, but I'm still waiting on appointments and have another one coming up in Dublin as well.""
She said transport options were already limited.
""The first time I had to go to Dublin, I just rang my doctor in Letterkenny and said I wouldn't be able to travel by car or bus, and that's when I was told about the Donegal cancer flights service,"" she said.
""From leaving my house to being in the hospital in Dublin takes about an hour and a half, maybe two hours with the flight.
""If I had to drive, it would take at least six hours and there's no way I could have done that in one go because of the constant pain I was in.
""Nobody really understands until they're in the situation. When you're unwell, the last thing you want to think about is travel.""

"55,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed in war with Russia, Zelensky says",2026-02-05T14:10:57.316Z," Sarah Rainsford
Eastern and Southern Europe correspondent
KyivandPaulin Kola
","The number of Ukrainian soldiers killed on the battlefield in the four years of war with Russia is 55,000, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
Zelensky announced the figure in an interview with France 2 TV on Wednesday. Additionally, a large number of people are considered officially missing, he said.
While both Kyiv and Moscow have regularly published estimates of the other side's losses, they have been reluctant to detail their own. However, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine.
US President Donald Trump has been leading efforts to end the war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour on 22 February 2022.
Special US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, held talks with Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi, for a second day on Thursday in an effort to try and thrash out the details of the US-proposed peace deal.
It was the second such trilateral meeting and the talks had been ""detailed and productive"", Steve Witkoff wrote on X, but ""significant work remains"".
The most difficult issue is territory, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cedes the rest of the eastern industrial region of Donbas that Moscow does not currently control.
Zelensky said the talks had not been easy, and Ukraine would remain ""as constructive as possible"", but wanted ""faster results"".
Trump often says thousands of Ukrainians and Russians die unnecessarily every week. Western intelligence agencies also publish estimates, which are impossible to verify.
The last time Zelensky gave an update on Ukraine's casualties was in December 2024, when he put deaths at 43,000.
In his interview with French television, he said: ""In Ukraine, officially the number of soldiers killed on the battlefield - either professionals or those conscripted - is 55,000.""
The official number of dead cited by Zelensky is considerably lower than Ukraine's total losses. As he said himself, ""a large number of people"" are registered as missing.
As of six months ago, Ukraine's interior ministry had recorded more than 70,000 people as officially missing - both soldiers and civilians - but the breakdown is never given.
The true figure may be higher - information about the number of dead is highly sensitive and affects morale.
Across Ukraine, military graves are prominent in all cemeteries - marked with blue and yellow national flags. They often have an image of the soldier in uniform engraved on the headstones.
We have also met mothers still searching for their sons, who never returned from battle.
Often, they cling to hope that the men are prisoners of war, captured and held in Russia somewhere but not on any official lists.
Access to Russian prisons for organisations like the Red Cross is highly restricted.
The alternative is that the missing men have been killed and their bodies not recovered from territory now controlled by Russia, or that their remains have not yet been identified using DNA testing.
Every so often, the two countries arrange an exchange of bodies - in addition to swapping prisoners of war - but there has been nothing at all since last August.
Another agreement on swapping prisoners was reached in the Abu Dhabi talks, Witkoff announced. It involved the exchange of 314 prisoners - ""the first such exchange in five months"", he said.
""While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,"" Witkoff added.
Zelensky confirmed 157 Ukrainians were released, and vowed to continue work so everyone was returned home. Russia's ministry of defence also showed pictures of its soldiers after they had been released by the Ukrainians.
At the end of the talks, the US European Command issued a statement saying the US and Russia had agreed to re-establish high-level military-to-military dialogue, which was suspended in the autumn of 2021.
""This channel will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace,"" the statement said.
The Abu Dhabi talks began as Russia renewed attacks on Ukraine after a week-long pause that Trump had asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.
It has been targeting the country's energy sector, leaving thousands without power and heating as temperatures dropped to -20C (-4F)"".

"Fearing Russia will seize her town, war widow moves husband's grave to Kyiv",2026-02-04T21:59:59.480Z," Sarah Rainsford
Eastern Europe correspondent
Kyiv
","The quiet of a Kyiv cemetery is broken by a trumpet salute, then a burst of rifle fire.
Soldiers stretch a Ukrainian flag over a shiny wooden coffin and stand silently alongside in the sparkling white snow. A woman cries, her face crumpling.
Natalia is burying her husband for the second time.
Vitaly was killed three years ago fighting in the eastern Donbas and his first grave was in their home town of Slovyansk. But Russian forces have advanced since then and the area is increasingly under attack.
So Natalia had her husband's grave exhumed and Vitaly's remains moved hundreds of miles to Ukraine's capital.
""When we buried him in Slovyansk, land was being liberated and we thought the war would soon end,"" Natalia explains, after the reburial ceremony conducted with military honours.
""But the frontline is constantly moving closer and I was scared Vitaly might end up under occupation.""
Vitaly was a ceramics artist who volunteered to defend his country in the early days of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.
""He didn't want to, but he had do it. He was a patriot,"" Natalia explains, through her tears. She was pregnant when her husband was killed and he never got to meet their daughter.
The decision to move Vitaly's body from the land where he was born and fought was extremely painful.
""It was very hard, emotionally. But it was the right decision,"" Natalia is sure. ""It would have been far harder to leave him, to know that he had stayed.""
Ukrainians are facing unimaginable choices now as the US tries to broker a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv, but Russia pushes on with its invasion.
That includes massive aerial attacks against Ukraine's energy system, against all rules of war.
Meanwhile, the most pressure for compromise is on Kyiv.
At some point, the US-led talks will hone in on the most sensitive issue of all: the status of land in the eastern Donbas region that so many men have died defending.
Ukraine still controls around a fifth of the area, including Slovyansk. But the town is close to the current frontline where Russian forces have been trying to push forward for months.
Kyiv proposes freezing the fighting there, ceding nothing more. But Moscow wants to be handed control over the rest of the region and the US is thought to agree.
That is far from Vladimir Putin's original plan to take over all Ukraine – to ""denazify"" and ""demilitarise"" as he snarled at the time. But it would allow him to claim a victory for Russia of sorts.
""There are drones in the streets, hitting minibuses, and glide bombs fall in the city centre, leaving craters,"" Natalia says, describing life in Slovyansk now, where her husband had been buried.
""A few months ago, the attacks were weekly. Now it's every couple of days.""
North of Natalia's hometown, up around the city of Kharkiv, there are more signs that the danger zone is spreading.
Workmen hammer stakes into the frozen ground to fit nets which they'll then stretch over the road in a canopy as protection against Russian drones.
Not far away, in an unmarked spot, we visited a workshop for Ukraine's own UAVs.
The soldiers of the Typhoon unit work in a basement filled with heaps of kit and cables, reached via a handmade wooden staircase. The men are responsible for repairing drones damaged at the frontline and for innovation: Ukraine needs every chance against an enemy with more men and more resources.
The music playing as the team work is chirpy French pop, but the soldiers' mood is mixed.
""We try not to discuss it here,"" 29-year old Roman replies, when I ask about giving up territory in return for peace. ""People quarrel and we don't need that right now. We need to unite, and fight the Russians.""
Roman lost ""a lot of guys"", he says, during his two years in the infantry, fighting in the Donbas.
No surprise that it's far harder to recruit these days. Last month the country's defence minister revealed that a staggering 200,000 soldiers were absent without leave.
But like many Ukrainians, Roman is sure that gifting the Donbas to Putin would not make Ukraine secure.
""The Russians will only come back for more,"" he says.
Hunched over a laptop in the back room, another soldier admits that ""victory"" in this war looks very different these days.
""I would say our victory is in preserving our statehood,"" Maksym argues, choosing his words carefully. ""Even if we have three square kilometres of land, but we keep our constitution and our institutions, then this is still Ukraine.""
He thinks the soldiers should fight on, regardless.
""Russia is 10 times our size. But still we can't surrender.""
Back in Kyiv, Natalia clings to the arm of a friend, as grave diggers shovel fresh earth onto her husband's coffin then slot a wooden cross into place on top.
A photograph of Vitaly shows him smiling, posing beside a yellow sunflower.
Natalia is relieved to have her husband close again where she and their daughter, Vitalina, can visit his grave safely.
""[She] watches videos of him, looks at photos and she loves him very much even though they never met,"" Natalia smiles.
She also hopes to tell her husband soon that she's pregnant using the sperm the couple had frozen specially at a clinic, just a few days before Vitaliy was killed.
Many soldiers now do the same before heading for the front.
It's a brutal fact, but Natalia says none of Vitaliy's soldier friends made it to his reburial, because so many of them, too, are now dead.
Ukraine has paid an immense price already for four years of all-out war.
Ceding land to Russia that it already controls is one thing: an option now quietly accepted by many.
But Natalia can't bear the thought of Russia taking more territory, including the town where she and Vitaly lived and were in love.
She has ""no doubt"" her husband would have wanted the army to fight on, not concede now.
""Russia may pause for a year, then there will be another breakthrough and they'll be in Kharkiv,"" Natalia says.
""I just don't believe Russia will stop.""

Church fresco resembling Italian PM has face scrubbed out,2026-02-04T20:04:47.473Z," Tiffany Wertheimer
","The face of an angel on a restored church fresco in Rome that sparked outrage because of its likeness to Italy's prime minister, has been crudely scrubbed out by the artist who painted it.
Church and government officials launched an investigation after pictures of a cherub at the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina showed her newly restored face had an uncanny likeness to right-wing leader, Giorgia Meloni.
The artist, Bruno Valentinetti, at first denied the claims, but on Wednesday he admitted that it was indeed the prime minister's face. He insisted that it was similar to the original, however.
Valentinetti, 83, told la Repubblica that he was ordered to cover up the painting by the Vatican.
The original facial features will now be restored, the office of the Diocese of Rome said on Wednesday, following a strongly worded statement from Rome's Cardinal Baldassare Reina.
Expressing his ""disappointment over what happened"", Reina said ""images of sacred art and Christian tradition cannot be misused or exploited"".
The Basilica of St Lawrence, which is a five minute walk from Meloni's office in the heart of Rome, has seen an influx of curious visitors hoping to catch a glimpse of the now-infamous fresco.
""There was a procession of people who came to see it and take selfies, not to pray,"" the basilica's priest, Rev. Daniele Michelett, told Ansa news agency.
Michelett said he had not noticed the resemblance to the prime minister when he first saw the restoration work, but agreed that it did not ""conform to the original iconography and sacred context"" of the church.
The Basilica of San Lorenzo in Lucina is one of Rome's oldest churches and features artwork by Baroque masters Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Guido Reni.
However the fresco at the centre of this controversy was not old - it was painted in 2000 and was not heritage protected.
The wall painting is located in a chapel dedicated to Italy's last king, Umberto II, and shows the cherub holding a map of Italy.
Bruno Valentinetti was the original artist, and had been asked to restore the artwork after water damage, Micheletti said.
The government agency in charge of preserving Rome's cultural sites has now informed the church that any further restoration work will require authorisation and a sketch of the proposed image.
The BBC has contacted the Vatican for comment.

Irish government to impose total ban on scramblers in public places,2026-02-04T19:12:24.811Z," Gabija Gataveckaite
Dublin correspondent
BBC News NI
","The Irish government is planning to impose a total ban on scrambler bikes in public places.
The new rules come after 16-year-old Grace Lynch died after being hit by a scrambler in Finglas in Dublin last month.
The new law will be called Grace's Law, according to Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin.
At a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, senior Irish ministers gave the go ahead for a total ban on scramblers in public places.
While laws around the use of scrambler bikes in public places are in place already, the Irish government hopes to bring ""additional legal clarity"" that scramblers are banned for use on roads in nearly all cases.
Under existing laws, mechanically propelled vehicles such as scramblers can only be legally driven on public roads if they are registered and have a registration plate.
There will also be an increase in the charged paid to release a scrambler after it has been seized, helping to reduce the number that end up back on our roads.
Regulations will also be changed so gardaí (Irish police) have more powers to seize scramblers and destroy them, instead of giving them back.
The Irish government believes that because most scramblers are designed for off-road use only and are unregistered, they are therefore already illegal for use on the road.
As scramblers are not registered, they cannot be taxed. Gardaí have powers to seize vehicles which are uninsured or have not been taxed or where the driver does not have the correct driving licence.
Gardaí will also be given more powers when seizing scramblers to reduce the numbers that end up back on the roads.
The government is hoping to enact the new laws within weeks.
The fresh clampdown is being brought forward by Transport Minister Darragh O'Brien as well as his junior ministers Sean Canney and Jerry Buttimer.
""These new regulations will help to bring additional legal clarity to the existing position that scramblers are banned for use on the road in almost all cases,"" said O'Brien.
""We owe it to Grace Lynch, her family and her friends to introduce regulations to further restrict the inappropriate use of scramblers in public places as a matter of urgency.""
The Irish government has previously put in place laws tightening the use of scrambler bikes.
Garda figures provided to RTÉ News recently showed 167 scramblers were seized last year.
BBC News NI reported last September that the PSNI received almost 10,000 reports involving scramblers across Northern Ireland over the last six years.

How plans for Trump International hotel in Belgrade unravelled,2026-02-04T18:14:19.338Z," Guy De Launey
Balkans correspondent
","The Trump International Hotel proposed for the Serbian capital Belgrade was supposed to mark a new chapter in the country's modern history.
It would take the place of one of the city's most arresting sights: the bomb-damaged, but still semi-functional, remains of the defence ministry complex, or Generalstab (General Staff) as it is otherwise known.
One major obstacle stood in the way: Generalstab was listed as cultural heritage.
The government tried to get around this by removing the complex from the register of protected buildings but now Culture Minister Nikola Selakovic is on trial for abuse of office, accused of using his position to influence or falsify documents to revoke Generalstab's cultural heritage status.
Prosecutors are calling for a three-year prison sentence, while President Aleksandar Vucic has promised to pardon the minister if judges convict him.
Whatever the verdict, it now seems highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to check into a Trump International in Belgrade.
The project always had been a hard sell, given the recent history between the US and Serbia.
US warplanes carried out the Nato air strikes in 1999 which reduced Generalstab to the shattered state in which it has remained.
Bearing in mind that Washington was also the main sponsor of Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, there is not an abundance of goodwill towards the US among Serbians.
So there was a collective raising of eyebrows in 2024 when Serbia's government struck a deal with the US president's son-in-law Jared Kushner to redevelop Generalstab through his Affinity Global company.
Surprise turned to outrage with his announcement last year that a Trump International Hotel would form the centrepiece of the project.
Vucic insisted the time was right for Serbia to ""overcome the burden from 1999"".
He told the BBC last year that his governing Progressive Party was ""ready to build better relations with the US"", saying: ""I think that is terribly important for this country.""
It soon became clear that many Serbs did not share that perspective – at least when it came to Generalstab.
Opposition to Kushner's project brought together an unlikely coalition of architects, military veterans and student-led anti-corruption protesters.
The architects pointed out that the bombed buildings had been the only project completed in Serbia by the renowned Yugoslav architect Nikola Dorbrovic, while the veterans saw them as a de facto memorial for the people who died in the 1999 air strikes.
The students noted that the deal with Affinity Global had gone through without any tender process.
None of this stopped the government from trying to push through the project. In November, MPs passed special legislation to allow the Trump Hotel to be built.
But prosecutors had also been keeping an eye on the affair, particularly efforts to remove Generalstab from the protected heritage register.
That led to them bringing charges against the culture minister and three other officials in December.
Selakovic responded by calling prosecutors an ""organised criminal group"" and an ""autoimmune disease"", accusing them of ""targeting the president"".
But the charges proved one controversy too many for Kushner. His company stated they wanted to ""unite rather than divide"" and their withdrawal was ""out of respect for the citizens of Serbia and the City of Belgrade"".
Vucic has made no secret of his fury. He has called the prosecution ""shameful and pathetic"" and ""disgusting political manipulation"".
Last month, his governing party pushed through amendments to judicial legislation, despite critics' warnings that this would reduce the independence of prosecutors and judges.
The EU's enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, described the laws as a ""serious step backwards"", saying they had been ""adopted in a very fast and non-transparent procedure, without any consultations"".
Protesters have been back on the streets of Belgrade, this time outside the court where the minister is on trial. They held a banner reading ""we are all witnesses"".
As for Kushner, his focus has switched to Albania, where he plans to build a luxury resort on Sazan Island. The country's Prime Minister Edi Rama says he is ""proud and happy"".
It is not yet clear whether a Trump International Hotel is in the offing.

German activist jailed in Hungary for attacks at Nazi rally,2026-02-04T17:34:54.538Z," Bethany Bell
","A German activist has been sentenced to eight years in a Hungarian prison for assaulting right-wing extremists and for being a member of an extreme left-wing group.
The 25-year-old, identified only as Maja T., was found guilty of involvement in violent assaults by the group Antifa Ost in the lead-up to an annual commemoration of Nazi soldiers in Budapest.
But supporters have raised concerns over whether Maja T., who identifies as non-binary, could receive a fair trial in the Hungarian court, because the country legally recognises only two genders and Pride marches are banned.
Last year, Germany's Constitutional Court found Maja T. could face discriminatory treatment and said an extradition should not proceed.
But the ruling came too late to stop the handover, as police in Germany had already delivered Maja T. to Hungarian authorities by helicopter in an overnight operation in 2024.
The 25-year-old did not comment on the allegations during the trial and the verdict is subject to appeal.
In February 2023, far-right groups from across Europe gathered in Budapest to commemorate the anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
The so-called Day of Honour marked an attempt in 1945 by the German Wehrmacht, the Waffen-SS, and their Hungarian collaborators to break through a Soviet siege of the city.
The commemoration is tolerated by the Hungarian authorities.
Between 9 and 11 February 2023, about 20 alleged left-wing extremists from Antifa Ost, a militant far-left multinational group also known as the ""hammer gang"", attacked people with batons, rubber hammers and pepper spray at several places in Budapest.
Officials said the attackers believed their victims had participated in the commemoration.
Nine people were injured in a number of incidents, four of them seriously.
Prosecutors said Maja T. was involved in two attacks and part of a criminal organisation.
German MEP Martin Schirdewan from the socialist Die Linke party described the proceedings as a ""political show trial"", and said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had ""deliberately exploited this trial for his election campaign"".
""Eight years in prison for Maja T. is disproportionate,"" he wrote. ""This is not about justice, but about setting a political example.""
Trials of other members of Antifa Ost are currently under way in German courts in Düsseldorf and Dresden.
Those trials are focused on the violence in Budapest and other incidents in Germany.
Hungary classifies Antifa Ost as a terrorist group, along with the US, which made the designation last November as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on Antifa activists.
The designation makes group members ineligible to enter the US, freezes any assets they may have there and makes it a crime to provide material support to the group.
Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has called for Antifa Ost to be banned domestically.

Lang refused to resign from his post as president of the Paris-based Arab World Institute after being challenged over revelations from the Epstein documents published in the US.
Earlier, his eldest daughter Caroline quit as head of France's Independent Production Union over her own links to Epstein.
Defending his position, Jack Lang told French broadcaster BFMTV he had known nothing about Epstein's criminal record when he met him ""some 15 years ago"". The US financier had been convicted in Florida in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution.
He killed himself in prison in New York in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Lang, 86, served as culture minister between 1981 and 1993, as well as minister of national education between 1992 and 2002. He also served briefly as a special envoy to Cuba and North Korea in 2009.
The former minister, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, said he had been introduced to Epstein by US actor-director Woody Allen, whom he described as a friend.
Epstein, by contrast, was ""not a friend"", Lang told BFMTV.
""I knew nothing about him,"" he said. ""I found the man passionate about art, culture and cinema.""
Over the course of their acquaintance, Lang requested favours such as the use of his car or plane for himself or his family, French daily Le Monde reports.
A brief video clip from the US Department of Justice files shows the two men standing outside the Louvre Museum in Paris.
""I am not in the habit of spitting on those I knew at a particular time and who went on to be accused of crimes,"" Lang said.
In an earlier statement, the former minister said that had he known of Epstein's crimes he would have ""immediately cut off all contact with him"".
Caroline Lang, a former actress and now a film producer, told French news website Mediapart she had met Epstein through Allen and his wife in 2012, and he had told her he wanted to ""invest in young French and international artists"".
She said his lawyers had set up a company, Prytanee LLC, but that she had not invested in it or received any money from it.
An email in the Epstein files suggested she contributed her art knowledge, Mediapart reports. She told the website she had been ""incredibly naive"".
Resigning from her post in the Independent Production Union, she said: ""I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union.""

"Boy, 14, stabbed art teacher because he had 'too much hatred', he tells police",2026-02-04T16:44:30.131Z," Doug Faulkner
","A 14-year-old who stabbed his art teacher told French police he attacked her because he had ""too much hatred"", a prosecutor has said.
The 60-year-old woman's condition remains a ""serious concern"" after she was stabbed three to four times in her chest in front of 22 students in south-eastern France on Tuesday, a local official said.
Toulon prosecutor Raphaël Balland said in a statement that the boy had premeditated the attack, having described to police taking the knife from his kitchen at home with the ""intention of stabbing his teacher"".
La Guicharde school, in Sanary-sur-Mer, was evacuated after the attack on Tuesday, and lessons the next day were cancelled.
Balland said there was no known religious or political motivation for the stabbing and that the student was allegedly upset that the teacher had reported several disciplinary incidents against him, which the boy said were ""unfair"".
The teenager told authorities he ""deeply regretted"" the attack, AFP news agency reported, and felt more hatred towards himself than the victim.
A decision on whether to place him in pre-trial detention will be made when he appears in court.
The victim, who has been at the school for 28 years, according to AFP, is in Sainte-Anne Military Hospital in Toulon. She is reported to have been stabilised after surgery but remains in a serious condition.
It is the latest in a series of attacks by students in French schools in recent years.
Last year, a 14-year-old was charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June.
In a separate case in April, a student killed a girl and wounded several others in a knife attack in the western city of Nantes.
In 2020, teacher Samuel Paty was murdered by a Chechen refugee outside the school where he taught in a suburb of Paris, an attack which was motivated by religious extremism.
Education minister Édouard Geffray, who visited the Toulon school on Tuesday, has described the attack as ""unacceptable"" and said that since March last year, 525 bladed weapons had been seized at schools ""before they could cause injury"".
""Schools reflect our society, and they cannot, on their own, stem the rise in verbal and physical violence that characterizes our times,"" he wrote on X.
""The real challenge lies here: fundamental work to de-escalate tensions. This involves families, teaching staff, elected officials, and every citizen. This is a fight we must wage together.""

Son of Norway's crown princess holds back tears giving evidence at rape trial,2026-02-04T16:00:39.370Z," Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor in Oslo
","The son of Norway's crown princess has told a court in Oslo he has lived a life of partying out of an extreme need of validation, on the second day of his trial for rape and more than 30 other alleged offences.
Marius Borg Høiby, 29, looked overwhelmed by the occasion, his voice quivering as he paused several times to take off his glasses and wipe his eyes.
Holding back tears, he said it was very difficult to talk, and complained of being followed by the press since he was three years old.
He denies four allegations of rape as well as other serious charges against him.
He was giving evidence after the first woman he is alleged to have raped told the court she believed ""100 percent"" that she had been drugged during an ""after-party"" in the basement of Høiby's parents' house in December 2018.
The woman spoke of her sense of ""betrayal and shock"" after police showed her videos several years later, allegedly depicting him sexually assaulting her shortly after they had had brief, consensual sex.
She had already spoken of a ""black hole"" in her memory and told the court behind closed doors that she had no recollection of what happened.
The court has ordered the media not to give any information that might identify any of the four women. There is also a ban on any photos of Marius Borg Høiby, either inside the court building or on his way to and from the trial.
The 29-year-old defendant, who was born four years before his mother, Mette-Marit, married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon, is not a member of the royal family or a public figure, but grew up as part of the wider family.
During his first appearance in court on Tuesday, he was seen shaking. He is understood have had hospital treatment overnight.
Høiby was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of assault and wielding a knife and remanded in custody for four weeks. However, he did not return to custody before his statement on Wednesday.
He took a seat in court and after several minutes appearing to be overcome by the occasion, he regained his composure and told the court he had had a lot of sex, drugs and alcohol because he had an extreme need of validation.
""I am known for being Mamma's son. Nothing else,"" he told the three judges.
""Few can relate to the life I have led. A lot of parties, alcohol, some drugs.""
His trial comes at a tense moment for his mother, who was found to have exchanged hundreds of messages with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein over a three-year period.
The royal palace said on Wednesday that Crown Princess Mette-Marit had postponed a private trip ""until further notice"", without giving further details.
She has expressed regret and poor judgement over the correspondence.
However, the storm of criticism over the unguarded, warm tone of the exchanges has heaped pressure on the royal house, when Mette-Marit is also seeing her son on trial for rape.
Marius Borg Høiby was arrested in August 2024 after a violent incident at his girlfriend's flat in the Frogner area of western Oslo, when he is alleged to have torn down a chandelier, thrown a knife at the wall and shattered a mirror, while hurling abuse at her.
At the time he spoke of having suffered for years with mental issues and admitted to substance abuse.
After a lengthy police investigation, he was charged a large number of offences, ranging from rape, assault, threatening a girlfriend and damaging her flat, as well as drugs charges and driving offences. If found guilty he could face at least 10 years in jail.
He is accused of raping four women between December 2018 and November 2024, all of them after consensual sex, and while they were either asleep or incapacitated. One of the charges involves full intercourse, and the other three sexual assault, which is also seen as rape in Norway.
Wearing a dark blue woollen sweater over of a smart beige shirt, he looked straight at the three judges who were sitting about 10m (30ft) away from him. Later in the afternoon he removed the sweater.
Although he had notes, he rarely looked down at them. He spoke for about half an hour without interruption.
Høiby did not look to his left where two of the women he is alleged to have raped listened to his evidence a short distance away.
The woman who gave evidence earlier did not stay in court.
He spoke of how he met her at a party in 2018 and had taken cocaine for the first time.
When he finished giving his statement, prosecutor Sturla Henriksbø asked him about the first alleged rape in 2018.
The defendant disputed the account given earlier, and said he did not remember taking videos, denying they had had brief consensual sex for a few seconds in a toilet in his parents' basement. Instead he said they had had consensual sex after others at the after-party had gone to bed.
Asked by the prosecutor if she had been awake when they had sex, he was adamant: ""I don't sleep with women who aren't awake.""
The 29-year-old has denied all but one of six counts of sexually offensive conduct without consent which includes filming graphic videos. In his testimony, he admitted filming a five-minute video of the woman in his family's basement, although he did not remember doing so.
When pressed by the prosecutor how he could be sure she was awake in the video, he appeared to become frustrated, saying he had said ""a million times"" he did not remember the sequence of events.
The woman's attorney, Heidi Reisvang, told the BBC that it had been extremely hard for her client to give evidence over two days and she was relieved it was over: ""The most important thing for her was to say she was not able to resist or give consent.""
Marius Borg Høiby also took aim at the Norwegian press, accusing them of twisting the facts, disputing a story that his mother had taken a sim-card out of his phone before it was handed to police at the time of his arrest in August 2024.
He is due to continue giving evidence on Thursday.

Thousands without power in freezing Ukraine as renewed Russian strikes continue,2026-02-04T14:55:09.893Z," Kathryn Armstrong
","Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says more than 200 repair crews are working to restore power in Kyiv following widespread deadly Russian attacks targeting the country's energy sector.
More than 1,100 apartment buildings in the capital are still without power, Zelensky said, adding that he had spoken to officials about supporting communities in other affected parts of Ukraine.
In the eastern Ukrainian town of Druzhkivka, seven people were killed and fifteen injured in Russian cluster bomb strikes, the regional head said.
Moscow has recently renewed its attacks after a week-long pause that US President Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe as a fierce cold swept Ukraine.
Meanwhile, US, Ukrainian and Russian officials are again meeting in Abu Dhabi to discuss details of a peace plan.
However, there a few signs a breakthrough is imminent during the second round of such trilateral talks in the United Arab Emirates.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

""As of today, the toughest situation is in Kyiv and the region, Kharkiv and the region, Sumy region, and Poltava region,"" Zelensky wrote on social media on Wednesday.
""It is also difficult in other parts of central Ukraine, including Dnipro and Cherkasy regions.""
He added that more repair teams would be brought in to help restore power ""to ensure proper rotation of crew members - people are exhausted.""
Residents have been forced to spend the night sheltering in Kyiv's metro stations, with some pitching tents on the platforms to protect them from the freezing cold.
Authorities have set up centres around the city for people to go to warm up. They are also importing more generators to cope with longer blackout periods as engineers try to fix the damage.
In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, a power plant has been damaged beyond repair.
Ukraine's Energy Minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country's energy system would take some time to fix. This includes Kyiv's Darnytsia Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant, which Shmyhal said had been ""severely damaged"".
Iryna Vovk is a psychologist who lives in Kyiv with her daughter. Her husband is away fighting.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Vovk said she was considering moving to her parents' village because of the problems accessing electricity and water in the capital.
""Here in Kyiv, life is very awful,"" she said.
Asked how her daughter is coping, Vovk said she was ""okay in general"".
""She tries to smile and lead a normal life but it's not a normal life. She cannot study [like] normal, she cannot use online lessons.""
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Russia's attacks on Ukraine's energy sector on Monday night - as temperatures dropped to -20C (-4F) - were ""barbaric"" and ""particularly depraved"".
He made the comments following a phone call with Trump hours after Russia hit power plants and critical infrastructure in Kyiv and elsewhere.
Trump told reporters that Putin had ""kept his word"" on the week-long pause.
The agreement ""was on Sunday, and he [Putin] went from Sunday to Sunday"", Trump said when asked whether he was disappointed with Russia's renewed attacks.
""It's a lot, you know, one week, we'll take anything, because it's really, really cold over there.""
The US president has been leading efforts to end the war, but his Russian counterpart has refused calls for a ceasefire.
The Ukrainian Air Force said it was attacked by more than 100 drones early on Wednesday. While it had intercepted most of these, it added, drone strikes were reported in 14 locations, along with falling debris.
Seven casualties were reported in Druzhkivka by Vadym Filashkin, the head of the eastern Donetsk region.
He wrote on Telegram that Russians had hit the city with cluster shells, including a busy market.
The head of Dnipropetrovsk's military administration, Oleksandr Ganzha, said a 68-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man were killed in a Russian attack.
In the Zaporizhzhia region, leader Ivan Federov said three people were killed and 11 wounded, including children, during attacks on Tuesday evening that continued overnight.
The Russian-controlled government in the neighbouring Luhansk region said a man and a woman were killed on Tuesday night in a drone attack, launched by Ukraine, which hit a minibus.
In Russia itself, the governor of the western Bryansk region, Alexandra Bogomaz, said Ukraine had launched a ""combined attack"" including drones and long-range missiles - destroying a residential building and injuring one person.
Further south in Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said work was continuing to restore power and water services following a Ukrainian missile strike there earlier in the week.
Meanwhile, peace talks continue, with top US envoys again meeting negotiators from Russia and Ukraine in the UAE on Wednesday and Thursday.
Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, are joining teams of Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the capital, Abu Dhabi, to try and thrash out a US-proposed peace deal.
The most difficult issue is territory, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cedes the rest of the eastern industrial region of Donbas that Moscow does not currently control.
The first talks between the three parties, which were also held in Abu Dhabi, ended earlier this month with no apparent result.

Greece blames smugglers over migrant deaths but early accounts have been questioned before,2026-02-04T13:22:02.403Z," Nick Beake
Europe Correspondent
","The death of 15 Afghan and Moroccan migrants after a speedboat carrying them collided with a Greek coastguard vessel has been presented by Greek authorities as an open and shut case.
A statement issued late on Tuesday blamed ""smugglers"" for ""failing to comply with the [Hellenic] Coast Guard's visual and audible signals"" to turn their boat around.
It said the migrant boat was making dangerous manoeuvres before veering into a patrol vessel, off the Chios Strait. The message was that this caused the deaths and the injuries of 24 others who were trying to reach European soil.
But experience tells us to be wary of such instant and unequivocal explanations.
In the summer of 2023, I arrived in the southern Greek port city of Kalamata on the day more than 650 migrants were feared to have drowned.
Already, an official Greek narrative had been established that this was a tragedy caused by criminal gangs cramming too many people into an unseaworthy fishing boat.
We were told there was nothing that could have been done to save those onboard, including the estimated 100 women and children who were travelling in the hold of the Adriana.
But survivors then told the BBC that coastguards had caused the migrant boat to capsize following a botched attempt to tow it.
As we returned to Greece to investigate over the following months, more and more contradictions appeared in the official account.
Nearly three years on, four senior figures in the Greek coastguard, including its current commander, are among 21 officers now facing criminal prosecution for negligent manslaughter over what was the worst loss of life in the Mediterranean Sea for a decade.
It is far too early to draw confident comparisons between 2023 and this latest case, but it may be useful to point out what has happened before where the coastguard has been present when migrants have died at sea.
As for Tuesday's fatal incident, near Chios, much of the Greek media has been amplifying the story that the migrant speedboat was manoeuvring dangerously and would not stop.
There has so far been no testimony from the survivors to back up or question that account.
There is also a lack of independent, third-party evidence that may support the scenario where the packed migrants boat had deliberately hit the specialist military speedboat.
Any video of the supposed collision could be hugely significant.
But it is not clear whether the coastguard was recording its interaction with the migrant boat.
In the case of the Adriana disaster in 2023, the patrol ship involved had been equipped with state-of-the-art, EU-funded, cameras.
They had been deactivated.
Mobile phone footage - taken by their coastguards or the migrants during this latest fatal crossing - could also be pivotal.
Again, we do not know what has happened to the phones owned by those involved on Tuesday night.
But we do know that in the 2023 case 20 mobiles belonging to migrants went missing for 25 days.
They were eventually discovered on the island of Kythira, 60 nautical miles from Kalamata, after being left in a bag on a coastguard vessel, so said officials.
Following previous migrant crossings, Greek authorities have often confiscated communication equipment of those detained for making illegal crossings, while they investigate who - if anyone - had been a smuggler, not merely a paying passenger.
Greece remains a key route for people from the Middle East and elsewhere wanting to reach the European Union.
The UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency, says 41,696 people arrived in Greece by sea in 2025.
That is a fall from 54,417 in 2024.
Last year 107 people were reported dead or missing attempting the crossing to the Greek mainland and islands.
Since 2019, the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has pursued a much tougher approach against illegal migration.
This has proved to be popular among many voters and was an important issue during the last general election, in 2023, which Mitsotakis's party won.
However, human rights groups have consistently accused the Greek coastguard of pursuing dangerous and illegal policies at sea.
The Greek government and the coastguard deny these accusations, saying its officers act within the law and have saved hundreds of migrants' lives at sea over the past decade.
But the EU border agency said last year that it was reviewing 12 cases of potential human rights violations by Greece, including some allegations that migrants seeking asylum were pushed back from Greece's frontiers.

Following the latest fatal crossing, opposition politicians have quickly condemned the Greek coastguard.
Gabriel Sakellaridis, a senior figure in the left-wing Nea Aristera party, posted on social media: ""Another Coast Guard deterrence operation, with specific political instructions from the government, which in the name of the 'tough' anti-immigration policy has turned Greek waters into a cemetery.""
In the Greek parliament on Wednesday, Immigration Minister Thanos Plevris said he trusted the account of the coastguards who were operating off Chios on Tuesday night.
He said they should be praised, in contrast to human rights activists who complained but saved no-one.
Many details about this latest incident are still unknown.
History suggests we may never know what really happened this time in the darkness of the Mediterranean Sea.

Collision with Greek coastguard boat leaves 15 migrants dead,2026-02-04T11:59:37.671Z," Nikos PapanikolaouandOlivia Ireland
","At least 15 migrants have died after a speedboat carrying them collided with a Greek coastguard vessel off the coast of the island of Chios late on Tuesday.
Greek authorities said the speedboat was making dangerous manoeuvres and that a pursuit was under way at the time of the collision in the Chios Strait, near the village of Vrontados.
Twenty-four people were rescued, some of whom were seriously injured, and others are reportedly still missing. Greek TV reports that the survivors say they are mostly Afghans, with one person saying they are Moroccan.
Confirming the collision, the coastguard said the speedboat had capsized and sunk.
Searches in the area continued on Wednesday.
The incident comes amid continued scrutiny of Greece's handling of migrant crossings following the Pylos shipwreck in June 2023, when hundreds of migrants died after an overcrowded fishing boat sank off the country's southern coast.
That disaster prompted investigations by Greek and international authorities into the role of the coastguard and wider search-and-rescue practices in the region.
A search and rescue operation continued on Wednesday in the waters off Myrsinidi beach, which involved four coastguard vessels, a privately owned boat carrying civilian divers and a helicopter.
Greek state broadcaster ERT said the injured included seven children, a pregnant woman and two coastguard officers.
The coastguard confirmed an inflatable patrol boat had seen an inflatable speedboat with foreign passengers and had been moving without navigation lights towards the eastern coast of Chios.
Authorities say light and sound signals were made to the speedboat but it did not stop, reversing course instead and colliding with the patrol boat on the starboard side.
The speedboat then capsized and sank, with all passengers falling into the sea.
The 25 injured people included seven men, seven women and 11 minors who were all taken to the Skylitseio Hospital. Later, one of the women died.
Post-mortem examinations are due to be carried out, with additional forensic staff travelling to Chios to assist with the process.
Three of the injured people had surgery after the accident caused serious trauma to their vital organs.
Hospital authorities said two pregnant women among the injured were going to have surgery after doctors said the foetuses had no cardiac activity.
Many of the injured were also being treated for hypothermia, head injuries and fractures. Some remain in intensive care, while others continue to receive treatment, including in the paediatric ward.
Greek Migration Minister Thanos Plevris said the deaths were a ""tragic incident"" while speaking during a debate in parliament about toughening criminal penalties against traffickers, AFP news agency reported.
""The criminals are the traffickers... who tried to drop off the migrants at Chios,"" he added.
Officials said that some of those being treated may be discharged later and transferred to the Vial reception and detention centre on the island.
Two members of the coastguard were also taken to hospital, with one man discharged and a woman held for further examinations after suffering what officials described as a mild concussion.
The coastguard confirmed two patrol boats had picked up a total of 14 bodies - those of 11 men and three women.
The bodies were taken to hospital for autopsies and the Central Port Authority of Chios has begun an investigation.
Greece's navy also issued a navigational warning, placing the search area under Greek co-ordination.
Naval vessels in the area were put on alert to assist if requested by the search and rescue coordination centre.
Authorities have not yet said how many people were on board the migrant boat, and the precise sequence of events leading up to the collision is still being examined.

Woman tells trial of Norway royal's son she suspects she was drugged,2026-02-04T11:19:13.450Z," Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor
Oslo district court
","The first woman to give evidence in the trial of Marius Borg Høiby, son of Norway's crown princess, has told of her sense of ""betrayal and shock"" after she was shown videos by police allegedly of him sexually assaulting her years earlier.
The woman told the court behind closed doors on Tuesday she had no recollection of what happened after brief, consensual sex at an ""after-party"" at his parents' house outside Oslo. Giving evidence on Wednesday she said she suspected she had been drugged.
The defendant, 29, is due to take the stand later for the first time.
He denies four counts of rape but admits some of the 34 other charges against him. He has not been accused of drugging anyone.
He has admitted to transporting drugs and speeding.
Appearing in court for the first time on Tuesday, he was seen shaking, and he is understood have had hospital treatment overnight, rather than returning to custody after he was arrested by police for an alleged assault on Sunday.
His trial coincides with a tense moment for his mother, after she was found to have exchanged hundreds of messages with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein over a three-year period.
The palace said on Wednesday that Crown Princess Mette-Marit had postponed a private trip ""until further notice"", without giving further details. However, the storm of criticism over the unguarded, warm tone of the exchanges has heaped pressure on the royal house, when Mette-Marit is also seeing her son on trial for rape. She has expressed regret and poor judgement over the correspondence.
She was a commoner when she married Crown Prince Haakon, and her son was already four years old. He is not a member of the royal family or a public figure but has grown up as part of the extended family. No member of his family will be attending the trial.
After his initial arrest in August 2024, Marius Borg Høiby spoke of years of mental health issues and of struggles with substance abuse.
Wednesday's first session in court took place behind closed doors, but a small number of journalists were allowed to follow proceedings from an adjoining room.
However, they had not been allowed on Tuesday to see the videos and images taken from Marius Borg Høiby's phone which police said showed the first witness being sexually assaulted while incapacitated at his parents' Skaugum estate in December 2018.
On Wednesday, the court was then shown videos of her reaction to the images during questioning by police years later.
Asked by the prosecution whether she had been awake or asleep, she told the court that she appeared to be ""completely unconscious - it doesn't even look like I'm breathing"". She said she suspected she had swallowed something without being aware of it.
Asked whether she thought she had been drugged, she replied: ""That's what I think.""
All four of the women alleged to have been raped were either asleep or otherwise incapacitated at the time of the alleged rapes, which all took place after consensual sex.
Heavy court restrictions have been imposed on the trial, with a ban on photos of the defendant or the women he is alleged to have raped inside or outside court.
Prosecutor Sturla Henriksbø said on Tuesday he would be treated no differently than any other Norwegian. But defence counsel Ellen Holager Andenæs said he had already been subjected to prejudicial treatment from the media.
It would be strange, she said, if someone facing such a ""tsunami of negative publicity over such a long time"" did not feel they were losing control of their life and destiny.
Speaking on Tuesday, the first witness said the situation was surreal and overwhelming, and that it was unfair she was being dragged into the criminal case. The alleged events took place in 2018 and it was not until after the defendant's arrest in 2024 that police found videos on his phone.
She told the court that they had had consensual sex for a few seconds before she put an end to it. Then she said there was a ""big black hole"" in her memory. Asked if she had fallen asleep afterwards, she was adamant that she had not.
Marius Borg Høiby's defence counsel told the court on Tuesday that he had pleaded not guilty to rape because he saw all the incidents as ""completely normal and voluntary sexual relations"".
She said the court would need to decide whether the four women had been unable to prevent what had happened, and if he should have understood that they were asleep or unable to resist.
The case will be decided by three judges - if they find him guilty, he could go to jail for at least 10 years.
Meanwhile, there are signs of disquiet among Norwegians from snap polls this week.
One survey by the Verdens Gang website suggested that its popularity was down to 60.9%. The same poll also suggested 44% of Norwegians believed Mette-Marit should not become queen.
The palace sees opinion polls as snapshots that change over time, and it will have been comforted by a vote by Norwegian MPs as the trial got under way.
Traditionally, they vote once in every parliament on a republican motion to abolish the monarchy and the motion came up by coincidence on Tuesday. The result was never in doubt - and only 26 of the 169 members of the Storting supported abolition.

Spain announces plans to ban social media for under-16s,2026-02-03T20:32:33.013Z," Tiffany Wertheimer
","Spain has become the latest European country to make plans to ban social media for children under the age of 16.
""We will protect them from the digital Wild West,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Tuesday.
The ban, which still needs parliamentary approval, is part of a raft of changes that include making company executives responsible for ""illegal or harmful content"" on their platforms.
Australia became the world's first country to bring in a ban last year, with others watching - and judging - its success.
France, Denmark and Austria have also announced that they are considering their own national age limits.
The UK government has launched a consultation on whether to implement a ban for under-16s.
Social media companies have argued that the bans would be ineffective, difficult to implement and could isolate vulnerable teenagers. Reddit is challenging Australia's ban in the High Court.
""Today, our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone,"" Sánchez said, describing social media as a place of ""addiction, abuse, pornography, manipulation [and] violence.
""We will no longer accept that. We will protect them.""
Sánchez first mooted a possible ban in November, but on Tuesday, the plan was fleshed out.
Under the changes, social media platforms would be required to have effective age verification systems, ""not just check boxes, but real barriers that work,"" the prime minister explained, in a possible reference to the loopholes Australian children use to bypass checks - including simply using a photo of an adult.
The new laws would also criminalise manipulating algorithms to amplify illegal content.
""This is something created, promoted, and disseminated by certain actors whom we will investigate, as well as the platforms whose algorithms amplify disinformation in exchange for profit,"" Sánchez said.
""Hiding behind code and claiming that technology is neutral is no longer acceptable.""
There would also be a new system designed to track ""how digital platforms fuel division and amplify hate"". No further details were given on how this would work.
Another measure, Sánchez said, would be to ""investigate and prosecute the crimes committed by Grok [X's AI tool], TikTok, and Instagram"".
The European Commission has launched an investigation into Grok over concerns it was used to create sexualised images of real people.
The UK has announced its own investigation into Grok and on Tuesday in France, the offices of X were raided by the Paris prosecutor's cyber-crime unit as it looked into allegations of offences including unlawful data extraction and complicity in the possession of child pornography.
X is yet to respond to either investigation - the BBC has approached it for comment. It has previously characterised the French investigation as an attack on free speech.
Sánchez said he hoped to get the laws passed next week, but that could prove difficult because his left-wing coalition government lacks a parliamentary majority.
Spain's main opposition party, the conservative People's Party, seems to approve of the ban, saying it has previously proposed similar restrictions. The far-right Vox party has spoken out against it, however.
In response to the announcement, X owner Elon Musk labelled Sánchez as a ""tyrant and traitor to the people of Spain"".
TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Reddit, Discord and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram have all been approached for comment.
France has led the charge in Europe, with President Emmanuel Macron saying he wants a ban for under-15s in place by the start of the next school year in September.

France teacher fighting for life after knife attack by pupil,2026-02-03T18:00:19.111Z," Maia Davies
","A secondary school teacher in south-eastern France was left in a critical condition on Tuesday after being stabbed by a 14-year-old pupil.
The 60-year-old female art teacher was stabbed three to four times in her chest in front of around 20 other students, according to a local official.
The pupil fled the classroom before being caught in the schoolyard, and was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
Toulon's public prosecutor Raphaël Balland said the suspect did not appear to have had a religious or political motive, adding: ""All we know is that there had been tensions with this teacher recently, and he was angry with her.""
La Guicharde school was evacuated after the attack in the early afternoon and Wednesday's lessons were cancelled, a regional education official said.
Earlier on Tuesday, France's Education Minister Edouard Geffray said he was heading ""immediately"" to the school in Sanary-sur-Mer, a coastal area of the Var region.
""My thoughts immediately go to the victim, her family, and the entire educational community, whose deep shock I share,"" he wrote on X.
It is the latest in a series of attacks by students in French schools in recent years.
In 2025, a 14-year-old was charged with the murder of a teaching assistant after allegedly stabbing her to death in June.
In a separate case in April, a student killed a girl and wounded several others in a knife attack in the western city of Nantes.
In 2020, teacher Samuel Paty was murdered by a Chechen refugee outside the school where he taught in a suburb of Paris, an attack which was motivated by religious extremism.

Two arrested over attempted sabotage of German naval vessels,2026-02-03T16:30:11.192Z," Ian Aikman
","Two suspects have been arrested over the attempted sabotage of German naval vessels docked at the Port of Hamburg last year.
The pair are suspected of deactivating electronic safety switches, removing fuel tank caps, puncturing water supply lines, and dumping more than 20kg (44.1lb) of abrasive gravel into a ship's engine.
""If gone undetected, the acts would have caused major damage to the ships and delayed their departure, endangering the operations of the German Navy,"" the EU's Eurojust crime agency said in a statement.
The suspects are a 37-year-old Romanian man and a 54-year-old Greek man who worked at the port, according to local media reports.
The suspects were arrested in Germany and in Greece on Tuesday following a coordinated effort between German, Greek and Romanian authorities.
Officers also searched and seized evidence from the suspects' homes in Germany, Greece and Romania, Eurojust said.
An investigation into the full circumstances around the incident is ongoing, the agency added.
While officials in Germany have not explicitly linked the Hamburg incident to Russia, the arrests come amid heightened fears over Kremlin-backed sabotage across the continent.
Germany and other Nato countries have seen a string of suspected sabotage incidents since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Undersea communications cables in the Baltic have been damaged, and suspected drone activity has caused major disruption at airports and military bases.
Though some European governments have directly accused Russia of involvement, the Kremlin has consistently denied orchestrating sabotage operations.
Germany has sought to increase its resilience to potential sabotage after an arson attack, which was previously linked to left-wing activists, left tens of thousands without power earlier this year.

Son of Norway's crown princess hears details of rape charges in tense trial for royal family,2026-02-03T16:19:18.809Z," Paul Kirby
Europe digital editor
Oslo district court
","Prosecutors in Norway have detailed four charges of rape against the son of Norway's crown princess in the biggest case to come to court here for years.
Marius Borg Høiby appeared in court to deny the most serious of the 38 offences he is accused of. The court also heard evidence from a woman he is alleged to have raped in 2018.
He is not a member of the royal family himself. His lawyer said he was a young man who deserved a fair trial and condemned press treatment of him.
The trial comes against a backdrop of almost daily revelations surrounding him and his mother, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, who is facing increasing criticism after it emerged she was cited in hundreds of emails showing extensive contacts with late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Mette-Marit, who married the crown prince when her son was four, has admitted showing ""poor judgement"", but the fallout has already begun, with one organisation dropping her as patron for its annual prize.
On the first day of the seven-week trial which began in courtroom 250 at Oslo district court, her son wore an ordinary sweater, white T-shirt and olive-green trousers, his blond hair cut short. He later removed the sweater and sat in court in a simple T-shirt.

Heavy court restrictions have been imposed on the trial, with a ban on any photos of the defendant inside or outside court.
As the charges were read out, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the four accusations of rape, speaking very quietly. At times he fiddled with a bracelet as public prosecutor Sturla Henriksbø detailed the charges against him.
Høiby partially admitted charges relating to a woman in Frogner in western Oslo in August 2024, admitting bodily harm but denying abuse. He admitted to several other allegations, including violating a restraining order, transporting marijuana and speeding.
Sitting opposite, to the right of the prosecutor, were some of the women named as victims in the case. The court has banned any detail that might identify the four women involved - a point underlined by the judge as proceedings opened.
The prosecutor set out details of the rape charges, alleging that the first took place during an after-party in December 2018 in the basement of the defendant's parents' house when he was 21.
The woman involved gave evidence at the end of the day during a closed session, which some journalists were allowed to follow from another room.
She said that they had sex for a few seconds before she stopped it. She remembered nothing of what happened next, calling it a ""big black hole"". Police later found videos on the defendant's phone, allegedly showing her being sexually assaulted without intercourse, which counts as rape in Norway.
All four instances of rape are alleged to have taken place after consensual sex, when the women were either asleep or incapacitated. One charge involved intercourse, the other three involve sexual assault.
Defence counsel Ellen Holager Andenæs said Marius Borg Høiby should be treated as innocent unless proven otherwise, and said it would be strange if someone facing such a ""tsunami of negative publicity over such a long time"" did not feel they were losing control of their life and destiny.
On the eve of the trial it emerged he had been detained for a fourth time, in circumstances not unlike his initial arrest, on suspicion of assault, making threats with a knife and violating a restraining order.
As police have placed him on remand for four weeks, he began the trial in custody.
His defence team intends to appeal against the decision.
The royal family will not attend the trial, although that is not seen as surprising by Norwegians.
Marius Borg Høiby was born four years before Mette-Marit married the crown prince, and although he is seen as a close member of the family he is not part of the royal family itself and not a public figure.
He faces an array of 38 charges:
rape with sexual intercourse while a woman was unconscious in October 2023
three counts of rape by sexual assault on incapacitated women - considered rape in Norway - in December 2018, March 2024 and November 2024
six counts of sexually offensive conduct without consent - including filming of victims
causing bodily harm
repeatedly abusing a current or ex-partner through threats, coercion or violence
violating a restraining order against him
transporting 3.5kg of marijuana
speeding
Some of the charges involving abuse and threats in August 2024 relate to the so-called ""Frogner woman"", and it is understood that his latest arrest is linked to her too.
He is expected to give evidence for the first time on Wednesday. The case will be decided by three judges - if they find him guilty he could go to jail for at least 10 years.
His mother suffers from a serious lung condition and has difficulty breathing. But it is not her health that has become the talk of Norway in recent days, rather her name cited in more than 900 emails published by the US Department of Justice late last week.
The tone suggests a future queen of Norway exchanging messages with her guard down, even though she knows she is talking to a registered sex offender who had spent time in jail. It has also emerged she spent four days at his home in Florida when he was not present.
The Sex and Society foundation, which focuses on sexual and reproductive rights, has said it no longer wants Mette-Marit to act as high patron for its annual Shameless Prize, because what had emerged was incompatible with what it stood for.
The crown princess is Norway's future queen, and the decision will come as a blow to her reputation.
Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre urged Mette-Marit to ""explain the extent of the contacts that have taken place"".
Norway's royal family remains very popular, with a Norstat opinion poll not long ago suggesting 73% were in favour of it.
However, the leader of Norway's Green Party, Arild Hermstad, who is a republican says the email exchanges point to a monarchy that is not working.
By coincidence, Norwegian MPs voted on Tuesday to reject a motion to abolish the monarchy that republicans submit by tradition every few years, a decision that was widely expected.

Restored angel fresco resembling Italian PM Meloni sparks investigation,2026-02-03T14:10:40.177Z," Maia Davies
","Church and government officials in Italy have launched an investigation into claims that the face of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was painted on an angel during the restoration of a fresco in Rome.
Italy's culture ministry has sent officers to inspect the artwork in a chapel of the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina, while the Diocese of Rome expressed its ""disappointment"" and said it would determine who had been responsible.
The artist, Bruno Valentinetti, said he had simply restored the fresco he painted in 2000 and denied modelling the angel after the prime minister.
Meloni responded in a post on Instagram saying she was ""definitely not like an angel"", accompanied by a laughing emoji.
The apparent likeness was first reported on Saturday by Italian newspaper La Repubblica, which ran before-and-after pictures of the fresco and claimed the angel holding a map of Italy had previously looked like a ""generic cherub"".
The parish priest said the paintings had simply been touched up following recent water damage - but said he did not ""understand the fuss"" in any case.
""Painters used to put all sorts of things in frescoes,"" Monsignor Daniele Micheletti said.
Valentinetti, 83, denied the claims. ""The restored face is the one that was painted 25 years ago,"" he said, in remarks reported by news agency AGI.
""Who says it resembles Meloni?""
Opposition parties were quick to urge an investigation. Irene Manzi of the Democratic Party called the situation ""unacceptable"" while the Five Star Movement said art must not become ""a tool for propaganda"", whether or not it depicted Meloni.
Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli ordered ""technical officials"" to inspect the painting ""to ascertain the nature of the intervention"" and determine next steps.
The Diocese of Rome, meanwhile, said it knew about the restoration but that it had been told nothing would be added or changed.
""The modification of the cherub's face was the decorator's initiative, not communicated to the competent authorities,"" it said in a statement shared by news agency Ansa.
It later said the Cardinal Baldo Reina - the Pope's Vicar for the Diocese of Rome - would immediately investigate ""to determine the possible responsibilities of those involved"".
It said the cardinal ""distances himself from Monsignor Micheletti's statements and expresses his disappointment over what happened"" and stated its ""commitment to the protection of its artistic and spiritual heritage"" against misuse or exploitation.

Desperate hunt for breakthrough in Nancy Guthrie case turns to Mexico,2026-02-19T12:09:31.260Z," Nardine Saad
","US investigators have reportedly been in touch with Mexican authorities about the disappearance of American news anchor Savannah Guthrie's mother, as the search stretches into a third week.
The sheriff's department in the US state of Arizona and FBI declined to confirm they had contacted authorities across the border to help trace Nancy Guthrie.
But her family has contacted a Mexican non-profit that works to find missing people in the region.
Investigators have been sifting through 40,000 leads since the 84-year-old was reported missing this month, but a breakthrough has eluded them despite emotional public appeals for help from her NBC presenter daughter.
US news website TMZ reported on Wednesday that the FBI had contacted authorities in Mexico, believing it was possible Guthrie could have been taken across the border.
ABC News cited law enforcement sources as saying the FBI had notified Mexican authorities of Guthrie's disappearance, although they had no evidence she had been taken across the border.
A Mexican security official told the New York Times the FBI had contacted officials in the state of Sonora, which shares a border with Arizona, to investigate an alleged ""purchase"" in the case, although that potential lead had apparently fizzled.
It is standard practice for federal investigators to talk with Mexican counterparts, especially in cases so close to the border, Fox News reports.
The Searching Mothers of Sonora, a Mexican non-profit dedicated to finding missing people in that state, often in cases linked to drug cartels, confirmed to CBS, the BBC's US partner, that it had been asked by a Guthrie family member to help the search.
There has been no suggestion from officials that Guthrie was abducted by narco-traffickers.
TMZ also said it had received a new ransom note via email demanding about $6m (£4.5m) in cryptocurrency.
The outlet, which previously reported receiving another possible Guthrie ransom note, said it had forwarded the new email to the FBI.
Guthrie was last seen at her Tucson, Arizona, home on 31 January when a family member dropped her off there after an evening at her daughter's house nearby.
Investigators believe she was abducted in the early hours of 1 February.
Officials say her family members have been ruled out as possible suspects.
On Tuesday, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told the BBC that DNA evidence taken from a glove found near Guthrie's home had produced no matches in a FBI database.
The glove had appeared to match ones worn by a masked man captured on surveillance footage on the night Guthrie vanished.
The sheriff said he was confident they would find her, whether it took ""10 days, 10 months, or worse"".
Nanos also said he believed Guthrie was being held somewhere close to her home.
The sheriff also told the BBC's US partner CBS News on Wednesday that investigators had not ruled out a theory that an accomplice was also involved in the suspected abduction.
Investigators are now using a device that might be able to detect Bluetooth signals coming from her pacemaker, law enforcement sources told CBS.
The sources said the tool, called a ""signal sniffer"", was mounted on a helicopter.
Guthrie's pacemaker was disconnected from her phone app on the night of her disappearance.

"Eleven killed in multiple strikes on alleged drug boats, US military says",2026-02-17T17:33:28.706Z," Ana Faguy
","Eleven people were killed in multiple strikes on three alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean, the US military says.
Officials said that of the 11 ""male narco-terrorists"" killed, four died on the first vessel in the Eastern Pacific, four on a second vessel also in the Eastern Pacific and three on a third vessel in the Caribbean.
The Trump administration has carried out more than 40 lethal strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean since September.
""Intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and were engaged in narco-trafficking operations,"" the US Southern Command said in a social media post.
No US military personnel were injured in the operation conducted late on Monday night.
US forces have been targeting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since September.
But the frequency of the strikes has notably ebbed since US forces in early January captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro - who has been accused by the Trump administration of working with drug trafficking groups.
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the overall operation is aimed at removing ""narco-terrorists from our hemisphere"" and securing the US from ""the drugs that are killing our people"".
The US has provided no evidence to back up its allegations that the boats it has struck have been carrying drugs.
Some legal experts have also said that the strikes could be illegal and violate international law by targeting civilians, with no due process.
The Trump administration has said the killings are lawful. In a statement to Congress, the White House said President Trump had ""determined"" that the US was in a formal armed conflict with drug cartels and that crews of drug-running boats were ""combatants"".
More than 130 people have been killed in the strikes.
Last week, a US Marine who fell overboard from an attack ship in the Caribbean became the first known American casualty in the Trump administration's operation targeting drug-trafficking boats.
A few families of the alleged drug-traffickers killed in strikes have gone to court against the US government.
The families of two Trinidadian men killed in a 14 October strike filed a lawsuit alleging the strike amounted to ""lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theatre"".

Attorney-General's alleged role in illegal adoptions rocks Guatemala,2026-02-17T16:42:27.910Z," Caitlin Wilson
","United Nations experts have called for an investigation into Guatemalan Attorney General Consuelo Porras for her alleged involvement in illegal adoptions of a number of indigenous children, which she denies.
The group of experts says that scores of indigenous children from the same children's home were reportedly put up for illegal adoption abroad during Guatemala's civil war.
In a statement, they say that Porras served as the home's director - and as the legal guardian of the children there at the time - for seven months in 1982.
Porras has categorically rejected the allegations that she was involved in any wrongdoing as false, adding that they ""were being used for political purposes"".
According to the experts, who are independent of the UN but appointed by it to advise on human rights matters, the allegations are ""gravely concerning"".
The accusations centre around the cases of at least 80 indigenous children who were sent abroad for adoption from Hogar Temporal Elisa Martínez.
The experts say that the children were put up for adoption ""following their capture and enforced disappearance between 1968 and 1996 in Guatemala"".
During Guatemala's 36-year-long civil war (1960-1996) , the country's military governments often targeted the indigenous Maya population, whom it suspected of siding with far-left guerrillas.
While many children's homes cared for minors left orphaned after mass killings, there were also cases of parents being tricked into handing their children over or even having them forcibly removed - and then put up for private adoption abroad for profit.
In their statement, the UN experts describe how illegal adoptions ""may occur through a range of illicit acts or unlawful practices, including fraud in the declaration of adoptability, falsification of official documents, coercion or lack of free and informed consent of biological parents and improper financial gain for intermediaries"" .
They add that they are ""particularly troubled that no prompt, thorough, independent and impartial investigation has been conducted into the alleged involvement of some State authorities in these processes"".
The public prosecutor's office, which Porras leads, called the accusations ""baseless, factually unfounded and completely malicious"", AFP news agency reported.
The UN statement came at a sensitive time for Porras, who has been campaigning for a spot on the Constitutional Court, Guatemala's top judicial body, and as she is seeking re-election for a third term as the attorney-general.
Her bid for a seat on the Constitutional Court was denied on Monday when she failed to garner enough support among the country's Bar Association - which had begun voting on the matter last week.
The prosecutor's office under Porras's leadership has faced international condemnation before.
In 2024 it was accused of trying to prevent President Bernardo Arévalo - who was elected following an anti-corruption campaign - from taking office.
Porras herself has been the subject of international sanctions over alleged corruption, which she has denied.
The US state department barred her from entering the United States in 2022.

Samba school that praised Brazil's Lula at Rio Carnival relegated,2026-02-19T10:47:09.944Z," Yang Tian
","Rio de Janeiro's annual carnival parade competition continued its tradition of vibrant dance and colour, with samba school Viradouro taking the crown for its tribute to its legendary drum director.
But there was an added element of entertainment this year: political controversy.
An homage to the life of Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva by samba school Acadêmicos de Niterói came in last place after it received political backlash even during rehearsals.
It will now be demoted from the top tier of samba schools and will have to take part in the ""second division"" Série Ouro (Gold Series) in 2027.
The performance charted Lula's path from poverty as a shoeshine boy to eventually reaching the highest post in the country. Tiago Martins, a carnival parade designer at the school, called it a deeply personal story.
""The samba says it: there are children of the poor becoming doctors, and me, a child of the poor, becoming a carnival designer,"" he told Reuters. ""We wanted to tell the story of a man who did a lot for the poor and for Brazil.""
However, the opposition criticised the decision to spotlight a sitting president as a sign of early campaigning ahead of the October elections, with Lula seeking a fourth term.
Several lawsuits alleging that Lula could gain a political advantage from the tribute were filed but rejected by the courts, with opposition parties even requesting the parade to be blocked.
Lula himself gave his blessing to the performance of Acadêmicos de Niterói and watched it with thousands of people from the stands in the city's giant Sambadrome arena.
Another pointed political message during Acadêmicos de Niterói's performance was a display of former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro as Bozo the Clown sitting behind bars.
The ex-president's son Flávio Bolsonaro has vowed to appeal a decision by the electoral court after it rejected requests by two opposition parties to prevent the parade.
Many on social media also took issue with a performance by dancers dressed as a traditional family preserved in a tin can titled ""preserved neoconservatives"" as mocking Christian values.
Despite the controversy, the parade of giant lions, dancing books and rainbow coloured plumes still delighted the crowds.
The performances are judged over 10 categories by a total of 40 judges, with the top 12 samba schools competing for the title.

Trump eyes Venezuela visit – but obstacles to his oil plan remain,2026-02-16T09:50:58.962Z," Robert Plummer
Business reporter
","After US President Donald Trump oversaw the seizure of his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro last month, he vowed to tap the country's oil reserves – the world's largest.
Trump now says that he plans to visit the South American country, although no date has been set.
His comments, made last Friday, came after US Energy Secretary Chris Wright completed a two-day trip to Venezuela to see how the nation is starting to reopen its oil sector to US companies.
Wright's visit came shortly after Venezuela's National Assembly passed a law to allow both private and foreign investment in its oil industry, following two decades of tight state control.
In Trump's eyes it is a big business opportunity for the US oil sector. ""We're going to be extracting numbers in terms of oil like few people have seen,"" he said at a news conference in mid-January, after a meeting with energy bosses at the White House.
But for the US oil firms that Trump wants to invest heavily in Venezuela, the question is a simple one - do the numbers add up?
William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, says the US president's aim is to ""revive Venezuela's oil sector and use that energy to increase supply and reduce costs to the consumer, possibly providing a source of revenue for a more friendly Venezuelan government to rebuild the economy after years of mismanagement"".
For US energy companies, however, there are huge practical difficulties to be overcome. Venezuela's state-owned oil company, PDVSA, is a shadow of its former self.
The governments of Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez milked the firm for all it was worth, and used the money to finance social spending on housing, healthcare and transport.
But they failed to invest in maintaining oil production levels, which have plummeted in recent years – partly, but not solely, because of US sanctions, which could now be revised.
""In Venezuela, you're dealing with equipment that's been degraded by many years of neglect,"" says Jackson. ""Ten to 15 years ago, Venezuela was producing 1.5 million barrels a day more than it does today.""
Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, agrees that PDVSA is in a parlous state.
""A lot of things have to be scrapped completely and rebuilt from the ground up,"" she tells the BBC. ""In fact, if political constraints did not matter, the best thing to do would be to scrap PDVSA, but that isn't going to happen.
""It's a big nationalist symbol, it's attached to sovereignty. Would the Venezuelans be willing to do whatever the US says and roll over? I don't think so.""
Trump has asked US oil firms to spend at least $100bn (£75bn) on restoring Venezuela's battered infrastructure – an absolute necessity before his plan to ramp up sales can be realised.
Officially, Venezuela has 300 billion barrels of oil reserves – yet in 2023, it exported just 211.6 million barrels of oil, worth about $4bn. Compare that to second-placed Saudi Arabia, which has 267 billion barrels of reserves, but had exports worth $181bn in the same time period.
So on paper at least, there is room for improvement. However, Jackson says there are doubts over the true size of Venezuela's oil reserves.
During the Chávez presidency, Venezuela reclassified its reserves. Previously, there were thought to be just 80 billion barrels of extractable oil, but by 2011, its reported figure had nearly quadrupled. That statistical change was made possible by high oil prices at the time, which allowed previously unviable projects to look feasible.
""There was a big step – jump – that people have questioned,"" Jackson says. ""But now the world is awash with oil and it's not clear that the same calculations still apply.""
When Chávez became Venezuela's president in 1999, oil prices were climbing. In the early 2010s, a barrel would often fetch about $100, providing the government with plenty of money to pour into social programmes. But with current prices around the $65 mark, the country looks less like a reasonable investment.
Venezuela's oil is also of poorer quality than its Saudi equivalent. Its sour, heavy crude is difficult to extract and refine, while its high sulphur content makes it corrosive to pipelines. A resurgence of Venezuela's industry could pose problems for Canada, which produces similarly viscous oil and exports much of it to the US, but analysts reckon the risk is minor.
According to research by Capital Economics, Canadian oil should remain competitively priced, even if Venezuelan production increases.
In the meantime, Venezuela's economic crisis has led to the exodus of nearly eight million people who have fled in search of a better life.
This includes expertise vital to keeping the oil pumps working: with the skilled engineers formerly on the PDVSA payroll now plying their trade elsewhere, the system limps on with a skeleton staff.
Thomas Watters, managing director and sector lead for oil and gas at research firm S&P Global Ratings, says US firms have the ability to repair Venezuela's infrastructure, but it has to make economic sense.
""At the end of the day, oil and gas companies have to deliver value to shareholders,"" he says. ""They have very good managers. You can build anything, as long as you can pay for it.
""But you need an oil price that makes that worthwhile. Unless you can generate sufficient money to justify that, it's very difficult to see the industry coming back.""
Besides, US oil firms have been bitten by Venezuela once before. In 2007, major US companies including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips had their assets seized when they refused to allow PDVSA to take majority control.
They went to the international courts and were awarded huge sums in damages – $8.3bn in the case of ConocoPhillips – which have never been paid.
Given that the current Venezuelan regime continues largely intact, with former Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez as interim leader, it will take a lot to dispel fears of renewed expropriation.
Moreover, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said the Trump administration has no plans to offer security guarantees to oil companies in Venezuela – a worrying omission in a country where state-sanctioned paramilitary groups known as ""colectivos"" often operate as criminal gangs.
Without bigger government incentives, oil firms will be reluctant to take what could be an expensive plunge. Small wonder, then, that ExxonMobil boss Darren Woods has called Venezuela ""uninvestable"" in its current state.
Tellingly, Trump did not come back with an offer of sweeteners to promote investment. Instead, he threatened to block ExxonMobil investment in Venezuela.
The policy is ""all stick, no carrot"", says de Bolle of the Peterson Institute. ""And it doesn't seem like they understand that they do need carrots.""
In de Bolle's view, the Trump administration has an ""imperialist vision"" of Latin America that leads it to see the region's resources as its property. For her, private oil firms' aversion to Venezuela is a welcome barrier to that kind of resource grab.
""This is a time when you think, 'Thank God the US doesn't have a state-owned oil company,'"" she says. ""They need the private sector, but for the moment, the private sector isn't budging. And what company in their right mind is going to put money into Venezuela?""
But if Venezuela's oil output does eventually surge, could it bring global oil prices down? Analysts refuse to be drawn.
""It depends on the scale at which it happens,"" says Jackson of Capital Economics.
""The situation is very fluid, very opaque, and there's a big geopolitical angle. We're in the early stages where Venezuelan production is concerned.""

Peru names eighth president in a decade after incumbent's ouster,2026-02-19T11:54:24.443Z," Vanessa BuschschlüterandYang Tian
","Peru has a new interim president following the removal from office of José Jerí by Congress over allegations of influence peddling, which Jerí has denied.
Member of Congress elected José María Balcázar, 83, to lead the country on an interim basis until the end of July - when a new president, who will be chosen in a general election, will be sworn in.
Balcázar, from the left-wing Free Peru party, is the eighth president to govern Peru since 2016, with several previous leaders also deposed by Congress.
He said he would ""guarantee the people of Peru a peaceful and transparent democratic and electoral transition"".
The first round of the presidential election will be held on 12 April, but with dozens of candidates vying for the top job it is unlikely that any of them will receive the 50% of the votes needed to win outright.
A run-off between the top two candidates, due to be held on 12 June, is therefore highly likely.
While previous presidents can run for a second term, the two terms cannot follow on from each other, meaning that both José Jerí and José María Balcázar are barred from standing.
Opinion polls suggest the top two candidates are right-wing Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori, whose father Alberto Fujimori ruled from 1990 to 2000, and the mayor of the capital, Lima, Rafael López Aliaga.
But the polls suggest that the vast majority of Peruvians have not yet decided who they will cast their vote for.
José María Balcázar will be in charge until the swearing-in ceremony of whoever wins is held on 28 July.
The former judge has been criticised for his opposition in Congress against a bill which outlawed child marriage. The bill was approved despite his vote against it.
Balcázar takes the reins of power at a time when trust in politicians is very low and has been further rocked by the graft allegations which led to Jerí's ouster.
One Lima resident told the Reuters news agency: ""In 10 years, how many presidents have we had? It's an enormous setback for the country.""
Another was quoted as saying that he had ""gotten used to this crisis, because we're really in a crisis where Congress only dedicates itself to changing the president and looking out for their own well-being"".
Jerí was forced out of office by Congress on Tuesday when lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favour of censure motion, which led to his immediate removal from the presidency.
The vote followed a scandal dubbed ""Chifa-gate"" - a local name for Chinese-Peruvian fusion food and the restaurants which serve it.
The controversy centred on several meetings Jerí had outside his official schedule with a Chinese businessman.
This businessman, Zhihua Yang, was under government scrutiny and while Jerí apologised for the meetings, the fact that he had not disclosed them - as he is obliged to do under Peruvia law - arose suspicion.
In one of the videos, Jerí could be seen wearing a hooded top during a late-night visit at one of Yang's restaurants.
He denied any wrongdoing and accused his rivals of a public smear campaign but he soon faced further criticism after it emerged that state contracts had been awarded to a number of women following late-night meetings they had with him in the presidential palace.
Jerí maintains his innocence and following his ouster said that it had been an honour to have served as Peru's president.
He was in office for just four months, having replaced former leader Dina Boluarte, who was impeached in October last year.

Peru's Congress ousts president after four months in office,2026-02-18T09:46:33.949Z," Yang Tian
","Peru's Congress has ousted interim President José Jerí just four months after he took office for failing to disclose meetings with Chinese businessmen.
The scandal unfolded last month after videos emerged of Jerí meeting several times outside his official schedule with businessman Zhihua Yang, who was under government scrutiny.
Jerí had previously apologised for the meetings, but denied any wrongdoing and accused his rivals of a public smear campaign.
His removal from office makes him the third consecutive president to be ousted, after he replaced former leader Dina Boluarte, who was impeached in October last year.
Jerí was Peru's seventh president since 2016 amid a tumultuous political landscape that has seen a succession of leaders leave the post under contentious circumstances.
He was not elected by the Peruvian people, but - as head of Congress - was sworn in as president after his predecessor, Dina Boluarte, was impeached in October 2025.
While lawmakers had set a date to discuss impeaching Jerí, in the end they opted for a different parliamentary procedure called censure, which only required a simple majority to pass rather than the super majority needed for an impeachment.
Later on Wednesday, Congress will name a new interim president who will serve only for a few months - until a new president is chosen by the people in a general election this April.
Jerí had come under fire following a series of controversies dubbed ""Chifa-gate"" - after a local name for Chinese-Peruvian fusion food and the restaurants which serve it.
Security camera footage of Jerí's meetings with Yang, who owns several businesses and was granted a state concession for an energy project, was first reported by local media.
In one of the videos, Jerí could be seen wearing a hooded top during a late-night visit at one of Yang's restaurants.
Also present at one of the meetings was another Chinese citizen who was under house arrest while being investigated for alleged links to an illegal timber network.
Peruvian law requires presidents to document all their official activities, but Jerí did not record those meetings.
Jerí faced further criticism after it emerged that state contracts had been awarded to a number of women following late-night meetings they had with him in the presidential palace.
Ruth Luque, one of the lawmakers who backed the censure measure, said she wanted a leader who would put public interest and security first.
""We ask to end this agony so we can truly create the transition citizens are hoping for,"" she said, according to Reuters news agency. ""Not a transition with hidden interests, influence-peddling, secret meetings and hooded figures. We don't want that sort of transition.""
Pressure had been mounting for Jerí to resign in the wake of the scandals as he faced a corruption investigation launched by the attorney general and his approval ratings plummeted.
His removal marks another chapter of instability for Peru, which is due to hold a general election in April, after which power will be transferred to a new president.
Jerí's predecessor Boluarte was impeached following a tenure that was plagued by protest, scandals and a surge in gang violence.
Less than a week after Jerí assumed power, protests organised by young Peruvians demanding the political class to do more to combat crime and corruption left one dead and more than 100 people injured.
Correction 18 February: An earlier version of this article said José Jerí had been impeached as Peru's president. This was later updated to say he had been ousted by Congress to better reflect the parliamentary procedure used to remove him from office.

Pressure grows for release of remaining Venezuelan political prisoners,2026-02-16T12:28:53.067Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter
","Pressure is growing on the Venezuelan interim government to free the remaining political prisoners being held in the country.
A pressure group campaigning on detainees' behalf, Foro Penal, said on Sunday that it had been able to verify that 444 political prisoners had been released since US forces seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro last month.
But hundreds more remain behind bars, according to a tally kept by Foro Penal, even though the Trump administration has pressured Venezuelan officials to speed up their release.
Activists say the health of some relatives who have gone on hunger strike to demand the release of their loved ones is quickly deteriorating.
Opposition party Vente Venezuela posted footage of one of the relatives - who appears to be unconscious - being tended to by others outside the Zona 7 detention centre in the capital, Caracas.
According to a pressure group, 10 people went on hunger strike on Saturday to demand that their relatives, who are being held at Zona 7, be freed.
They have been holding a vigil outside the police detention centre since 8 January, when the head of Venezuela's National Assembly, Jorge Rodríguez, first announced that ""a significant number"" of prisoners would be freed as a goodwill gesture to demonstrate what he said was the interim government's will ""seek peace"".
While the Trump administration has praised Venezuela's interim government for the progress it has made so far, activists within the South American country have denounced delays and a lack of transparency in who is being freed.
Members of the opposition have also denounced that those who have been released have been barred from speaking out publicly.
They cite the case of opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa as evidence that those released are not ""really free"".
Guanipa was released on 8 February after eight months in jail, only to be seized again hours later for allegedly breaking the conditions of his release. He has since been placed under house arrest.
Last week, students took to the streets to demand an amnesty for those who have been jailed as part of the widespread repression against critics of the government of Nicolás Maduro.
Venezuela's interim government - led by Maduro's former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez - has put forward an amnesty bill since Maduro was removed from power in a US raid on 3 January.
The bill passed its first reading unanimously on 5 February but lawmakers failed to approve it as scheduled last week as they could not agree on how it should be applied.
The bill is due to be discussed further this week.

Police wear fancy dress in Rio Carnival phone theft sting,2026-02-14T23:14:44.709Z," Alicia Curry
","Brazilian police have disguised themselves using fancy dress to blend in as Carnival-goers to target phone thieves in Rio de Janeiro.
The undercover officers donned masks depicting Captain America, Batman and Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th, among others, to nab a pair in the act, Brazil's Civil Police said.
The two people were arrested after a woman was spotted by a drone grabbing a phone from someone attending Rio's famed Carnival before passing it to her alleged male accomplice, they said.
The festival, which began on Friday and runs until next Saturday, attracts millions of visitors and locals each year to its street parties and parades - but there is often a spike in petty crime.
Five stolen phones were recovered during the operation in the Santa Teresa neighbourhood and will be returned to their owners, the Civil Police said.
Footage it published showed officers, still in their masks, leading the two suspect away and into a waiting police car. Among the disguises was the red overalls and mask from the Spanish Netflix show Money Heist.
Police said the two seen being detained in the footage had 30 criminal records between them, and that the woman pretended to be pregnant to avoid arrest.
Police added that the arrests form part of Operation Tracking, a state initiative aimed at tackling the theft and resale of mobile phones, which has led to more than 13,000 devices being located and approximately 4,400 being returned.
It is not the first time Latin American officers have used fancy dress while apprehending suspected criminals.
Peruvian police often use the tactics, disguising their agents in elaborate costumes on occasions such as Valentine's Day, Halloween and Christmas.
In November last year, officers found suspected cocaine in a trick-or-treat bucket whilst dressed as Spider-Man.
An agent dressed as a teddy bear pounced on a suspected drug dealer during a Valentine's Day operation earlier the same year.
Raids have also been carried out dressed as the Grinch, a capybara and various other Marvel superheroes.

Oil refinery blaze hits Cuba as fuel crisis deepens,2026-02-14T03:03:27.522Z," Harry Sekulich
","A fire at an oil refinery in Cuba has been brought under control quickly, as the country faces a deepening fuel crisis.
Black smoke clouds could be seen billowing from the Ñico López Refinery in the capital, Havana, on Friday.
No-one was injured and an investigation into the blaze has been established, Cuba's energy ministry said in a post on X. The fire occurred close to where two oil tankers had been moored in Havana Bay.
A fuel shortage in Cuba has been worsened by the US blocking oil shipments from Venezuela, a long-standing ally in the region, to the island.
Venezuela was previously believed to have sent it around 35,000 barrels of oil a day before the US military captured former president Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, on 3 January.
The US also confiscated Venezuelan oil tankers, cutting off key supplies of fuel to Cuba, and pledged new tariffs on countries that sell oil to Cuba.
US President Donald Trump has urged Cuban leaders to ""make a deal"" or face unspecified consequences, after flows of oil and money from Venezuela were cut off.
Electricity cuts have impacted hospital emergency wards, dialysis patients and pumping stations amid the latest supply shortfalls.
Cuba also has a shortage of aviation fuel, leading several airlines to suspend services to the Caribbean island nation, while some countries, including the UK, have warned against non-essential travel there.
""Authorities have introduced fuel rationing, scaled back public services, and made temporary changes to healthcare, education, transport and tourism operations to conserve severely limited energy supplies,"" the UK Foreign Office warned recently.
As the oil embargo continues to make life and access to essentials difficult in Cuba, two Mexican ships carrying 800 tonnes of humanitarian aid arrived in Havana Bay on Thursday.
United Nations human rights experts have described Washington's restrictions on Cuba's oil imports as an ""extreme form of unilateral economic coercion"".
UN human rights chief Volker Türk said he was ""extremely concerned"" about the worsening crisis in Cuba.
The US and Cuba have had a strained relationship since the communist Fidel Castro overthrew a US-backed government in 1959. US economic and trade embargoes on Cuba have been in place since 1960.
While steps were taken to improve diplomatic relations, particularly under former US President Barack Obama, the Trump administration has reversed many of these moves.

Loyal dog who lived by owner's grave for 10 years inspires new law in Brazil,2026-02-12T12:13:01.930Z," Maia Davies
","A dog who spent 10 years living in the São Paulo cemetery where his owner was buried has inspired a new law permitting the burial of pets with their families in the Brazilian state.
Nicknamed Bob Coveiro - meaning ""gravedigger"" in Portuguese - the loyal dog brought comfort to mourners and became a fixture at the graveyard until his death in 2021, when he was buried alongside his guardian.
The law named after the canine came into effect on Tuesday and recognises the ""emotional bond"" between pets and their human families, the state government said.
One of its authors, representative Eduardo Nóbrega, wrote on social media: ""What began as a story of love and loyalty has turned into public policy.""
Bob attended his owner's funeral at the cemetery in Taboão da Serra and refused to leave thereafter, Brazilian media reported - even returning when family members tried to take him home.
He was given a green dog house to live in and was known to accompany funeral processions at the site, where he was eventually buried with his owner after being hit by a vehicle in 2021.
Local animal protection charity Patre, which led a fundraiser for a statue in his memory, said Bob ""won the hearts of everyone who met him"".
It said in a statement: ""People who were saddened by burying their loved ones would manage a smile when the little dog, who was crazy about balls, tried to play.""
Nóbrega said of the Bob Coveiro Law on Wednesday: ""Anyone who has lost a pet knows: it's not just an animal. It's a family. And this law recognizes this bond, bringing more respect at the moment of farewell.""
""Love does not end at goodbye,"" he wrote on social media.
It means cats and dogs can now be buried in family graves in the southeastern state - Brazil's most populous - provided sanitary standards are met, with local funeral services to determine the rules for doing so.
Brazil has the world's third-largest pet population, with 160 million animal companions, according to data from the Pet Brasil Institute.

"Venezuelan opposition politician under house arrest after kidnap, son says",2026-02-10T18:07:56.106Z," Amy Walker
","Venezuelan opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa has returned home after being captured by security forces on Sunday - but is under house arrest, his son has said.
Ramón Guanipa said while his family was ""relieved"", his father remained ""unjustly imprisoned"".
The country's opposition leader María Corina Machado said on Sunday that Guanipa had been taken in the capital Caracas by ""heavily armed men"". It came hours after Guanipa and other political prisoners were released.
Venezuela's Interior and Justice Minister Diosdado Cabello later said ""a person"" was rearrested ""for violating the conditions under which he was released"".
""Some politicians believed they could do whatever they wanted,"" Cabello added on Monday.
A former vice-president of the National Assembly, Guanipa spent eight months in prison and is among several political prisoners to have been freed since the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in January.
In an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, Ramón said his father, leader of the Justice First party, had initially been released from prison at about 11:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Sunday.
He said his father then spent time with families waiting for the release of other political prisoners.
""He made some statements, he mobilised a lot of people,"" Ramón said, continuing: ""He went on an interview... and after that he was kidnapped by security forces that weren't wearing uniform, that weren't identified properly.""
During the BBC interview, Guanipa's son said he had been informed that his father would be returned and placed under house arrest. But he said no further information was shared about when his father would be transported.
Later on Tuesday, Ramón posted on his father's X account, saying: ""I confirm that my father, Juan Pablo Guanipa, is at our home in Maracaibo. We are relieved to know that our family will soon be together.""
He added: ""My father remains unjustly imprisoned, because house arrest is still imprisonment, and we demand his full freedom, as well as the freedom of all political prisoners.""
Ramón thanked the US government, including President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for ""their efforts in support of freedom in Venezuela and for all political prisoners"".
Guanipa's centre-right party had previously said the 61-year-old was kidnapped by the ""repressive forces of the dictatorship"" while he was moving between locations.
It added that those accompanying him warned that weapons were pointed at the group before Guanipa was loaded into a car.
""We hold Delcy Rodríguez, Jorge Rodríguez, and Diosdado Cabello responsible for any harm to Juan Pablo's life,"" Justice First wrote on social media, referring to Venezuela's interim president, the National Assembly speaker, and the interior minister respectively.
The party also called on the international community to demand Guanipa's ""immediate release"", as well as an end to the Venezuelan government's ""persecution of the opposition"".
When Guanipa was recaptured on Sunday, Ramón and a key figure in Venezuela's opposition, Edmundo González, had demanded proof of life.
Guanipa, a political ally of Machado, was among at least 30 people freed on Sunday, according to Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal, which provides assistance to political prisoners in the country.
He was elected governor of the Zulia region in 2017, but barred from taking office after refusing to swear an oath before Maduro's National Constituent Assembly.
He then went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the 2024 election result.
Guanipa was later tracked down by Venezuela's security forces and detained in May 2025.
Opposition and human rights groups say the government under Maduro had for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.
Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, when Maduro claimed victory despite opponents and many countries disputing the results.
The Venezuelan government has denied holding political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.

Venezuela's opposition says party leader kidnapped hours after being freed,2026-02-09T16:22:20.810Z," Yang Tian
","Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said her opposition colleague Juan Pablo Guanipa has been kidnapped just hours after being released from detention.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner said on Sunday that Guanipa, leader of the Justice First party, was taken in the Los Chorros neighbourhood of the capital, Caracas.
""Heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes arrived in four vehicles and took him away by force,"" she wrote on social media early on Monday.
A former vice-president of the National Assembly, Guanipa spent eight months in prison and was among several political prisoners released since the US seized Venezuela's then-president Nicolás Maduro in January.

Another key figure in Venezuela's opposition, Edmundo González, demanded proof of life, saying on X that the ""absence of information"" on Guanipa's whereabouts ""constitutes a forced disappearance"".
Just hours earlier, Guanipa's son Ramón was celebrating his father's release on social media: ""Our entire family will be able to hug again soon.""
He subsequently posted a video online, in which he demanded immediate proof that his father was still alive.
""I hold the regime responsible for anything that happens to my father. Enough of this repression,"" Ramón Guanipa said in the video.
Guanipa was among at least 30 people freed on Sunday, according to Foro Penal, which provides assistance to political prisoners in Venezuela.

Venezuela frees high-profile opposition figure Juan Pablo Guanipa,2026-02-08T22:16:22.643Z," Aleks Phillips
","Venezuela has freed Juan Pablo Guanipa, a political ally of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, after eight months in detention, his son has said.
The former vice-president of the National Assembly is among several political prisoners to have been released since the US captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in January.
""Our entire family will be able to hug again soon,"" Ramón Guanipa wrote on social media, cautioning: ""There are still hundreds of Venezuelans unjustly imprisoned.""
Opposition and human rights groups say the government under Maduro had for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.
Though the interim government instituted in his absence promised on 8 January that ""a significant number"" of detainees would be released, this has progressed slowly in the weeks since, with a handful being released at a time.
Foro Penal, which provides assistance to political prisoners in Venezuela, says nearly 400 people have been released.
Its president Alfredo Romero said at least 30 people had been freed on Sunday, including Guanipa. Perkins Rocha, Jesús Armas and Luis Tarbay were also named as having been released.
Since Venezuela's widely disputed presidential election in 2024 - which saw Maduro officially re-elected despite opposition tallies suggesting their candidate had won by a landslide - critics of his regime said legal proceedings against activists, journalists and Maduro's political adversaries increased.
Among them was Guanipa, who went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the 2024 result.
He was tracked down by Venezuela's security forces and detained in May 2025.
Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado, who was also in hiding at the time, said her colleague had been ""kidnapped"" in ""an act of state terrorism"".
Guanipa is the leader of the centre-right Justice First party. He was elected governor of the Zulia region but barred from taking office after he refused to swear an oath before Maduro's National Constituent Assembly.
With Maduro standing trial on drug trafficking charges in New York, Guanipa's son appeared sceptical a few days after the interim government announced its ""goodwill gesture"".
Ramón Guanipa told BBC Mundo at the time that he felt ""defeated"" when his father was not among the first detainees to be released.
""But at the same time, you find another reason to fight,"" he said. ""I'm fighting for them [the interim government] to actually do what they say they're going to do.""
Releasing political prisoners was one of US President Donald Trump's demands of the interim government, describing it as ""a very important and smart gesture"" from Venezuela.
He chose not to install Machado as Venezuela's president after capturing Maduro in a daring raid on Caracas, instead allowing Maduro ally Delcy Rodriguez to take over.
In the weeks since, Rafael Tudares, the son-in-law of Edmundo González, who stood against Maduro in 2024's election after Machado was barred, has been released, as has prominent Venezuelan rights activist Javier Tarazona.

'I've never hit anything so hard': What it's like to be attacked by a shark,2026-02-04T05:58:29.501Z," Will Vernon
","It was the last hour of the last day of Peter Smith's holiday in Tobago when he decided to take a dip in the sea.
""The conditions were perfect for a swim,"" the retired IT director recalls. ""I dived into the waves, swam out no more than 20 feet (6m), and stood waist-deep in the water.""
He and his wife Joanna, from Hertfordshire, were away with friends, and the last thing on their minds was the risk of shark attacks - they are unheard of on this tiny Caribbean island.
""Suddenly I felt a very heavy object hit my leg. I look down and there's a shark - and it's big,"" Peter says.
""You're talking maybe 10 foot (3m). That's when your brain works at 1,000 miles an hour.""
He had been bitten by a bull shark, one of the most dangerous sharks in the world and notorious for hunting in shallow waters.
In his first interview since the attack in April 2024, Peter tells BBC News about his terrifying experience - and why he's still not scared of sharks.
The 66-year-old says he instantly recognised the jaws clenching onto his leg as those of a bull shark. Fearing he would be dragged underwater, he decided to put up a fight.
""I start punching the shark. To be honest I don't know what I was trying to do, but I was hitting it,"" Peter says. ""I can honestly say I've never hit anything as hard as I hit that shark.
""After hitting my leg, it managed to attack my left arm and then my stomach. The situation got serious really fast. I lost a lot of blood.""
Finally, the animal stopped its attack long enough for Peter to be dragged from the water by people nearby.
His friends John and Moira, who were beside him in the sea, each helped fight the shark and raise the alarm. Back on the beach, Joanna, alerted by Moira's screams, ran to the shoreline.
""I remember going into the water and seeing his terrible injuries. I could see bones, it was just awful,"" Joanna recalls. ""And somebody said, 'Get her away from here.'""
Peter was taken to the only hospital on Tobago with deep lacerations to his stomach, a large bite on one arm and a huge part of his upper thigh bitten off.
He describes the pain kicking in as he was being put in the ambulance. ""I'm screaming, I'm crying, losing a lot of blood and losing consciousness. People are screaming at me to stay awake.""
Joanna, 64, a retired NHS worker, says she didn't know whether her husband would make it out of the ambulance alive: ""He was so pale, it was really scary.""
She remembers how the Tobagan doctors asked if she could sign a form for her husband's limbs to be removed if necessary - then doctors realised he should be taken off the island. ""They'd run out of blood…he'd taken all the blood in Tobago,"" Joanna says.
He was taken to the Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, for specialist treatment. Over the next few weeks, he underwent dozens of operations - including one where medics told him they would put a special membrane over a wound to give a better surface for a skin graft.
""Then they laughed. So we were saying, 'Well, what's funny?' And they said, 'the membrane is made from shark'."" Peter laughs. ""So I have a piece of shark in my leg.""
So began the long road to recovery. His upper thigh injury meant he had to learn to walk again and issues with the nerve in his arm, severed by the shark's bite, means he still has no feeling in his fingers and difficulty gripping – issues he will have for life.
""I'm really grateful. At least I have mobility issues. At least I have limbs,"" he reflects. ""At one stage it looked like I wasn't going to have any.""
Not only is he thankful to his doctors, but his friends who came to help him during the attack, too. ""I fought it along with other people who were really brave. I'm forever grateful to them.""
The bull shark has been linked to several recent attacks in Australia. At the end of January, the country saw four shark attacks in just 48 hours, one resulting in the death of a 12-year-old boy. Three of the attacks were within a nine mile (15km) stretch of each other on the east coast.
It's led experts to caution that shark attacks are still very rare relative to the higher rates of people using the water for leisure - and urge the public to remember the ocean is a wild space with risks.
According to the world-renowned International Shark Attack File, the 2024 attack on Peter was the first and only shark attack ever recorded in Tobago.
Shark expert Tom 'The Blowfish' Hird explains that bull sharks have ""certainly got a fire inside them"" and ""are known to retaliate when they have been either chased by boats or when they've been tagged"".
But he says the fact that fatalities from shark bites are rare shows humans aren't necessarily on the menu. ""Let's be very crystal clear here: if a bull shark, or a tiger, or a great white did want to prey on a human, there would be no body.""
The demonisation of sharks is unfair, Hird believes, and he says most sharks realise quickly that humans often fight back, and aren't good to eat.
Peter doesn't want what happened to him to tarnish the reputation of the Tobago and feels he has no cause to be scared.
""The people in Tobago were really good to me. They depend on tourism for their livelihood. I'd go back,"" he insists. ""I still think of the sky and the sea.
""What's the point in surviving a shark attack if you're going to live the rest of your life in fear?""

BBC joins Colombian commandos fighting 'never-ending battle' against drug gangs,2026-02-03T17:12:42.137Z," Orla Guerin
Senior International Correspondent in Colombia
","The Black Hawk helicopter was ready for take off – its rotor blades slicing through the air in the deadening heat of the Colombian Amazon. We ducked low and crammed in alongside the Jungle Commandos – a police special operations unit armed by the Americans and originally trained by Britain's SAS, when it was founded in 1989.
The commandos were heavily armed. The mission was familiar. The weather was clear. But there was tension on board, kicking in with the adrenaline. When you go after any part of the drug trade in Colombia, you have to be ready for trouble.
The commandos often face resistance from criminal groups, and current and former guerrillas who have replaced the cartels of the 1970s and 80s.
We took off, flying over the district of Putumayo - close to the border with Ecuador - part of Colombia's cocaine heartland. The country provides about 70% of the world's supply.
Just ahead two other Black Hawks were leading the way.
Down below us there was dense forest and patches of bright green – the tell-tale sign of coca plant cultivation. The crop now covers an area nearly twice the size of Greater London, and four times the size of New York, according to the latest figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), published in 2024.
President Donald Trump says Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro is not doing enough to prevent cocaine from his country winding up on America's streets. Last month he called him ""a sick man who likes selling cocaine to the United States"" and said ""he could be next"" for US military intervention. But that threat appears to have receded.
President Petro counters that his government has seized the largest amount of drugs in history. But on his watch cocaine production has also soared to record highs, according to the United Nations 'World Drug Report 2025. Petro disputes the UN's method of counting.
The fight against drug production and trafficking from Colombia will be high on the agenda when the two presidents meet in the White House on Tuesday.
After 20 minutes, we land at a clearing in the jungle and see the first stage of a global drug trade. The commandos lead us to a crude cocaine lab, partly hidden by banana trees. It's little more than a shack but it has the key ingredients – drums of chemicals and a mound of fresh coca leaves, ready to be turned into a paste.
Two women and a man emerge from the trees, probably workers at the lab – willing or unwilling. One of the women is in torn clothing and all wear wellington boots. The commandos question them briefly but make no arrests. Colombia's anti -narcotics strategy targets those at the top of the cocaine trade, not the dirt-poor farmers at the bottom.
Minutes later we are rushed away as the commandos prepare to set the lab alight – destroying the crop, and the chemicals.
""There are 50 or 60 more labs in this area,"" says one officer, who does not want to be named.
Dense black smoke rises from the forest as we take off. An energy drink is handed around among the commandos, who could soon be doing this all over again. Weather permitting, it's rinse and repeat. They carry out these operations several times a day.
Back at base, Major Cristhian Cedano Díaz takes a few moments to unwind with his men. He's a 16-year veteran of the war on drugs, standing ram rod straight, with a handgun in a holster around his neck - and with no illusions.
When asked how quickly a drug lab can be rebuilt, his response is immediate.
""In one day,"" he says, with a rueful smile. ""It's just a matter of changing or moving a few metres. We have seen it before. Sometimes, when we return to areas where operations have taken place, we find structures have been rebuilt just a few metres away. ""
But he insists that destroying one lab after another serves a purpose.
""We are affecting the profitability of the criminal groups,"" he says. ""They can rebuild countless times, but they are losing the coca crop, and the chemical precursors they need.""
His enemy is evolving. Colombia's drug gangs use drones and bitcoin and bring chemists into the jungle to create ingredients on site. Major Cedano Díaz, 37, admits the cocaine war may not be over his lifetime.
""I dream of the day [when that happens],"" he says. ""I imagine our descendants see it and will remember those we lost to achieve that goal.""
His losses include several colleagues of different ranks, in different parts of the country.
""Sadly, we had to bring flags to their families, and say they were no longer with us,"" he says. ""I remember them with pride for continuing to fight in a never-ending battle.""
Under attack from Donald Trump for not doing enough, Colombia's Defence Minister Pedro Sanchez has defended his country's record, politely.
""The president has been misinformed,"" he told us. ""We destroy cocaine factories every forty minutes. And over the past three and half years we have seized 2,800 tonnes of cocaine. That amounts to 47 billion doses of cocaine that never reached foreign markets.""
He argues that the demand for cocaine is also a problem, not just the supply. ""With cocaine use rising in Europe, it's very difficult to eradicate the supply here,"" he says.
Cocaine is the second most commonly used illicit drug in Europe – after cannabis – according to the European Union Drugs Agency. It says the availability and use of the of the drug continue to increase, ""resulting in greater costs to society"".
We followed the cocaine trail from the Amazon to the Colombian Andes, bordering Venezuela. Here the peaks extend into the clouds, and the beauty is matched by the hardship.
We changed vehicles – to a car owned by a trusted local contact - before beginning the step climb up the mountains in Catatumbo. You don't come here unannounced.
There are two guerrilla groups in this area – the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), most of whose members demobilised after a peace deal in 2016 ending half a century of civil war.
We met a local farmer – we are calling him ""Javier"" – who insisted that growing the coca plant was the only way to feed his family.
He showed us his latest crop, some of it shoulder high. When we wanted to get some footage with a drone he warned us to stay low. ""Otherwise, guerrillas will see it,"" he said.
Home for Javier is a bare breeze block house, with no glass in some of the windows, and the sound of children's laughter coming from inside. He has five daughters - ""the most beautiful thing God has given me"", he says. His eldest is in college, studying to be a teacher.
His two youngest girls play, in a discarded bookcase – the nearest they have to a dolls house. Javier speaks with regret about not being able to buy his daughters presents at Christmas, and about his struggle to feed them.
I point out his crop could kill someone else's children. Does he ever think about that, I ask.
""The truth is yes,"" he says. ""Sometimes you do think about that.
""But if you want to survive, you don't. There are no opportunities with this government. I have children, and of course I think about other children who could be harmed. It's not about whether you want to [grow coca] or not. You have to.""
He shows us his makeshift lab, down a muddy track. He cooks up cocaine paste here, when he has the chemicals and the fuels.
But these days he says the local guerrillas aren't buying because of a turf war. When he risked a journey to a local town to make a sale he was robbed of his crop and his phone.
Javier is thinking of going back to his old job – coal mining – for economic reasons rather than moral ones. But he says the mines have also been hit hard by the government. ""Insurance went up,"" he tells us, ""so wages went down.""
He's had no trouble with the authorities, so far. ""I believe they know what's happening here,"" he tells us, ""but the truth is they don't come around – maybe because of the armed groups.""
He has a plea for President Trump: instead of threatening Colombia, consider why farmers like him grow the coca plant, and send economic help.
Javier is 39 – just two years older than Major Cedano Díaz. Both men are on opposite sides of this country's drug war, and both are hoping their children will inherit a different Colombia.

Bus carrying pilgrims overturns in Brazil killing 15 on board,2026-02-03T16:39:57.010Z," James Gregory
","At least 15 people have died as the bus they were travelling in overturned in northeastern Brazil, local officials have said.
The vehicle had been carrying about 60 people who were returning from a pilgrimage when it crashed on a curved stretch of a highway in the rural interior of Alagoas state on Tuesday morning.
Three children were among those who died, a statement said, while some surviving passengers were airlifted to hospital for treatment.
Footage on social media shows a bus turned on its side, with debris surrounding it and emergency crews at the scene.
An investigation has been launched.
Authorities said they believed that the driver had lost control of the bus before it left the highway and rolled over several times.
According to media reports, the most seriously injured patient transferred to hospital was a nine-year-old child who suffered a head injury.
The passengers were taking part in the pilgrimage of Our Lady of Candeias, a religious festival in the state of Ceará.
The bus was part of a convoy carrying hundreds of people from the city of Coité do Noia in Alagoas to Juazeiro do Norte in Ceará, a journey spanning 563km (350 miles) which normally takes around eight hours.
The incident happened in São José da Tapera on the final stretch of the journey back to Coité do Noia.
Bueno Higino Filho, mayor of Coité do Noia, told local media: ""The loss is immense. They were all my friends... I woke up today to the sad news and I'm heading to the site of the accident to see what we can do [to help].""
Three days of mourning have been declared by the governor of Alagoas state.
""I stand in solidarity with the family members and friends in this moment of such great pain,"" Paulo Dantas wrote on social media.

Candidate tough on crime wins Costa Rica presidential election,2026-02-02T09:22:58.912Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter
Latin America online editor
","The candidate for the governing conservative Sovereign People's Party, Laura Fernández, has won the presidential election in Costa Rica.
With more than 88% of the votes counted, Fernández had over 48% of the votes, far ahead of the second-placed centrist candidate, Álvaro Ramos, who conceded defeat.
Fernández ran on a promise to deepen the tough-on-crime approach of the outgoing President Rodrigo Chaves, who had handpicked her as his successor.
Voters had said they were concerned about a surge in drug-related violence in the Central American country.
The size of her vote share - which exceeded the 40% needed to win outright in the first round - means that there is no need for a run-off.
Fernández will be sworn in on 8 May.
In her victory speech, the 39-year-old said she would plough ahead with the policies introduced by Chaves, whose chief of staff she was.
Under Costa Rica's constitution, presidents are not allowed to serve two consecutive terms and Chaves was therefore barred from standing for re-election.
Fernández has hinted she may appoint him to a post in her cabinet.
Costa Rica, one of Central America's safest countries and a stable democracy, has seen a rise in crime over the past years as transnational criminal gangs have expanded in the region.
On the campaign trail, Fernández said she would emulate some of the policies of the El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele.
Bukele has sky-high approval ratings with Salvadoreans saying they are grateful for his iron-fist approach to crime, which has seen the murder rate plummet.
Fernández has said she will declare a state of emergency in areas where gangs hold sway and finish the construction of a high-security jail similar to the Cecot prison in El Salvador.
Addressing concerns by her critics that her policies could erode the rights of citizens, Fernández declared in her victory speech that her government would be one of ""dialogue and national harmony, respectful and firmly based in the rule of law"".
She did however strike a combative note too, criticising the opposition for its ""obstruction and sabotage"" in a reference to the challenges Chaves faced getting some of his policies approved in parliament, which was dominated by opposition lawmakers.
With her party winning 30 out of the 57 seats in parliament, Fernández is expected to have more backing in the legislature than her predecessor in office.
Before running for the presidency, the 39-year-old served as planning minister as well as in other posts.
But above all, she is seen as the heir to Chaves, whose direct and sometimes confrontational style she shares.
She is also expected to maintain the close ties her predecessor built with the US.
Chaves signed a ""safe third-country migrant agreement"" with the US, which means the Trump administration can deport migrants from countries other than Costa Rica to the Central American nation.
The agreement allows the US to remove migrants from countries deemed unsafe to a third country considered safe.
The Trump administration has described Costa Rica as a ""key global cocaine transshipment point"", adding that is had ""become an increasingly significant waypoint for criminal organisations trafficking cocaine"" to the US.
Fernández has said she would be would be willing to declare a state of emergency - and lift some of citizens' rights - if organised crime where to further take hold in certain areas.
She will become the second woman to govern the Central American nation after Laura Chinchilla, who was elected president in 2010.

Venezuelan MPs approve bill to open up oil sector to private firms,2026-01-30T00:59:49.194Z," Ione Wells
South America correspondent
","Venezuela's National Assembly has approved a reform of the country's hydrocarbons law that will allow private companies, including foreign firms, more autonomy in the country's lucrative oil sector.
Once the law is signed off by the country's interim president, it is expected to pave the way for more foreign investment in the oil industry.
US President Donald Trump has been pushing US oil companies to invest in Venezuela's vast oil reserves, despite decades of mismanagement, under-investment and a still uncertain political climate.
But one of the barriers for investors had been the existing framework that gave the state oil company PDVSA majority control over operating oil projects.
Shortly after Venezuelan MPs signed the law, the US eased its sanctions on the country's oil industry giving US companies more ability to operate in Venezuela.
The Treasury Department issued a general licence approving a range of oil-related transactions, including oil refining ""by an established US entity"".
Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, but many foreign firms left after the industry was first nationalised, and then years later state control over production was tightened further.
Some firms say they are still owed compensation after these changes were made to their contracts.
Despite the huge reserves, the industry there has suffered after years of mismanagement and under-investment in the infrastructure, as well as heavy sanctions including by the US.
This new domestic reform would allow private firms to operate oil fields if they had approved contracts and would give companies in joint ventures with the state firm PDVSA more control over projects and more direct access to proceeds from oil sales.
Existing international partners, such as the US firm Chevron which has continued to operate in Venezuela despite US sanctions due to a special licence, have previously requested reforms to the law.
The assembly, dominated by lawmakers who are allies of former president Nicolás Maduro, passed the bill with the backing of interim President Delcy Rodríguez, who assumed office after Maduro was seized in a US military operation earlier this month.
National Assembly speaker Jorge Rodríguez, Delcy Rodríguez's brother, urged lawmakers to support the reform as part of efforts to attract foreign investment.
The changes mark a significant shift from the 2006 hydrocarbons law introduced under former president Hugo Chávez, which tightened state control over the sector.
Analysts say the reform could help attract back foreign oil companies that had largely withdrawn from Venezuela in recent years.
The vote comes amid US-Venezuela negotiations over the sale of sanctioned Venezuelan oil, with Washington licensing the export of tens of millions of barrels.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the proceeds will be sent to an account, initially in Qatar.
He said Venezuela would submit monthly budgets to the White House and funds would then be released under US sanctions controls for public services in Venezuela such as policing, sanitation workers, and to buy medicines.
In a separate move, American Airlines announced on Thursday it would resume flights to Venezuela for the first time in more than six years.
This move came after Trump said he had asked the Transportation Department to lift restrictions barring US flights.

BBC visits oil region at heart of Trump plan to 'Make Venezuela Great Again',2026-01-30T00:03:18.024Z," Norberto Paredes
BBC News Mundo
Lake Maracaibo
Venezuela
","With its neat rows of detached family homes, complete with grass lawns and porches, Miraflores could be mistaken for a typical American suburb.
Located in the heartland of Venezuela's oil industry, on the Costa Oriental (Eastern Coast) of Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo, this quiet neighbourhood once helped to make the country one of the wealthiest in Latin America. It was a symbol of national prosperity.
This used to be one of the world's most productive oil basins, and along with the city of Maracaibo, across the lake, is seen as key to President Donald Trump's plan to get US firms to invest $100bn (£75bn) to rebuild Venezuela's energy industry. The country has the world's largest proven oil reserves, estimated at about 303 billion barrels.
But for now, the area around Lake Maracaibo stands as a stark reminder of how much the country's fortunes have declined over the decades.
The BBC World Service is the first international broadcaster to visit the region since the US military seized Nicolás Maduro from his presidential compound in Caracas in early January, and took him to New York to face narco-terrorism charges - accusations he denies.
There are oil pumps and rigs dotted everywhere - on street corners, in surrounding fields and rising out of the lake. While a handful have been freshly painted in the yellow, blue and red of the national flag and remain operational, many others have not moved in years and are rusting and falling apart.
The decay is striking in the 20 or so American-style ""oil camps"" on the fringes of the lake - these were originally built by international companies to house their workforce, after the commercial exploitation of Venezuela's oil reserves took off in the 1920s.
Oil giants such as Standard Oil of New Jersey (which later became Exxon), Chevron and Shell invested heavily in Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city. Oil money turned former fishing villages into affluent communities with hospitals, schools, and social clubs.
In Miraflores, which housed the industry's top executives, many homes now sit abandoned and looted, their windows smashed and wiring stripped bare.
Gladysmila Gil moved to a more modest neighbourhood nearby in 1968 with her late husband, who worked in the oil industry and had the home given to him.
""When we moved into this house, it was in good condition,"" she recalls, sitting on a frayed chair and looking at the pink paint peeling off the walls.
""If we were sick, we went to the hospital and they treated us. The rubbish was collected every other day, and we didn't have these power outages,"" she adds of the economic decline Venezuela has experienced over the past 13 years.
Now rubbish is only collected sporadically and despite the oil reserves, the region has been hit by a severe energy crisis over the past decade with blackouts reported almost daily.
An unfinished light rail system mired in corruption allegations, a run-down central hospital which patients have described as ""hell"" and deepening inequality make it feel like a microcosm of the country. Venezuela's gross domestic product (GDP) has declined by more than 70% since Nicolás Maduro became president in 2013.
""You don't see kids in these streets, there is no youth. I used to live here with nine relatives, and they all left,"" says 64-year-old José Gregorio Martínez, the son of a former oil worker, sitting on his front porch.
Fighting back tears, the retired teacher explains that he only survives thanks to the money his relatives send from abroad. His monthly state pension of $2.80 (£2) does not even cover his most basic needs.
Gil and Martínez recall what they see as the golden days, and are not alone in hoping that new investment from US companies will transform their lives.
In the 1970s, Venezuela pumped as much as 3.5 million barrels of oil per day - accounting for more than 7% of total global output.
Then, production was managed by a network of foreign firms, many from the US, operating under government concessions, until the industry was nationalised in 1976 and taken over by the state-owned giant, PDVSA.
The industry continued to form the backbone of the country's economy, benefiting from the high oil prices of the 1970s. When oil prices fell in the 1980s and Venezuela ran into an economic crisis, reality hit. There were protests as the government introduced austerity measures to try to balance the books.
In the 1990s, reforms were introduced to open doors to foreign investment and in 1999 the country still produced about 3.2 million barrels of oil per day, with approximately half of that output coming from Zulia state, the region around Lake Maracaibo.
Then came the rise of Chavismo - an anti-American, nationalist ideology created by Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chávez.
He became president in 1999 as oil prices were on the rise again, enabling his government to fund huge social programmes designed to lift millions out of poverty.
But by the end of 2025, oil output had fallen to about 860,000 barrels per day, less than 1% of global crude production.
Many cite 2002 as a turning point for the industry, when a strike by oil workers against Chávez's government was followed by a sweeping overhaul of PDVSA. It is widely reported that up to 22,000 people were fired.
""You can't lose 22,000 technical people in a company and expect that nothing happens,"" says Jorge, not his real name, who was dismissed at the time. He says the shake-up aimed to align the company with political priorities and that much of the experienced management resisted, ultimately losing their jobs.
In 2007, the oil sector was transformed again when President Chávez's government seized control of the industry.
Some foreign firms remained under new state-led partnerships, while others - most notably ExxonMobil - left the country, and the industry's decline accelerated.
Mismanagement and corruption have been a problem for the sector, but the government has pointed the finger firmly at US sanctions as a major cause of the decline.
Broad economic sanctions were put in place in 2017 during Trump's first term, in response to what it called ""serious abuses of human rights… establishment of an illegitimate Constituent Assembly, which has usurped the power of the democratically elected National Assembly… rampant public corruption"" and ""persecution of, and violence toward, the political opposition"".
The turning point for the US came with the seizure of Nicolás Maduro. President Donald Trump said the US would ""run"" Venezuela and control the sale of its sanctioned oil ""indefinitely"", but a Maduro loyalist - Delcy Rodríguez - has since taken control of Venezuela's armed forces and the country's institutions.
While defiantly demanding the release of Maduro, who she says has been ""kidnapped"", Rodríguez has co-operated with the Trump administration to reform the law to allow foreign and local oil companies to operate oilfields again, through a new contract model.
The Venezuelan parliament - dominated by Maduro loyalists - approved this major shift on Thursday.
Many in Maracaibo are optimistic about potential US investment.
""It would be better because then there would be work, and our children wouldn't have to resort to fishing. They could have a future instead,"" says Carlos Rodríguez. Now in his late 20s, he has worked these waters since he was a teenager.
As he pulls his oil-stained boat out on to the lake, the view is striking. The beauty of the sky contrasts sharply with the water, sometimes blue, but often a murky green from cyanobacteria or stained black. It's easy to see the oil slicking the surface and when I dip my hand in, it comes out streaked with oil.
""It's getting worse every day. Green, black, oily,"" Rodríguez complains. ""And there are fewer fish."" That morning, he didn't catch a single one.
He hopes that if international oil companies return, they will help clean the lake.
Others are wary. ""We have no problem with [foreign companies] coming to exploit our resources, to drill wells and to create jobs,"" says another fisherman, José Luzardo. ""But we don't want to be anyone's colony.""
He is a staunch Maduro loyalist, but admits that both his family and colleagues are struggling.
Trump ""can come, but he has to pay us for the oil… the oil belongs to Venezuela, it belongs to all Venezuelans"", he says as he prepares to set sail.
Many others - in particular people who oppose the government - avoid speaking about politics for fear of repercussions.
Later, the sound of the lake's waves lapping against the side of Luzardo's house competes with the sizzle of hot oil. In a kitchen with bare, unplastered walls, a group of women fry the few fish caught that morning. Luzardo says they were lucky. Sometimes they come back home with nothing at all. On those days, they go to bed hungry.
Both the government and the opposition agree on the need for investment.
Juan Romero, a member of parliament representing Zulia and a local leader of the ruling PSUV party, says it is the key to the industry's revival.
""In Lake Maracaibo, there are approximately 13,000 wells that could be recovered, and there are reserves of 26 billion barrels of oil,"" he says.
With US sanctions removed, he believes the ""economic strangulation"" of the sector will end and that Venezuela will be able to attract foreign money.
But analysts warn it could take a decade and hundreds of billions of dollars to restore the nation's former output, and industry giants remain cautious. ExxonMobil's chief executive, Darren Woods, labelled the nation ""uninvestable"" in its current state.
Speaking at a White House summit following the removal of Maduro, he pointed out that the company had had its assets seized there twice ""so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes"". Without a new legal framework and stronger protections for investors, he warned that the billions of dollars required for redevelopment would not materialise.
Yet for many in Maracaibo, hope remains that investment and prosperity will return.
Among them is 93-year-old José Rodas, a retired oil worker who still owns a special-edition Dodge Dart, a classic American muscle car that he bought during the 1970s oil boom.
""Things have become more difficult,"" he says. ""In the past, life was easier. We had comforts then.""
He points to the ""commissariat"", a central department within the oil camps that not only provided subsidised food but also maintained the workers' homes, with fresh coats of paint and new light bulbs.
Today, the car sitting on his neglected porch feels like a faded relic of that former life.

"Plane crashes in Colombia, killing all 15 on board",2026-01-28T22:48:52.277Z," Jaroslav Lukiv
","A passenger plane has crashed in northern Colombia, killing all 15 people on board, the country's state-run airline Satena confirmed.
In a statement, it said its aircraft - a Beechcraft 1900 - ""suffered a fatal accident"", but gave no further details. The wreckage has now been located in a mountainous area.
The official passenger list includes lawmaker Diógenes Quintero Amaya and Carlos Salcedo, a candidate in upcoming congressional elections.
Satena earlier said contact with the plane was lost 11 minutes before it had been scheduled to land in the city of Ocaña, near the Venezuelan border, at 12:05 local time (17:05 GMT) on Wednesday.
According to the airline, Flight NSE 8849 took off from the city of Cúcuta, about 100km (62 miles) north-east from Ocaña, carrying 13 passengers and two crew members.
A search operation has been launched in the mountainous area, and a hotline was set up for the relatives of those who were on the plane.
Speaking to local news outlet Semana, governor of Norte de Santander William Villamizar said seven bodies have been recovered.
Colombia's armed forces have been helping with the search effort in the area where the plane went missing, which has areas controlled by Colombia's ELN guerrilla group.
The country's president Gustavo Petro expressed his condolences to the families of the victims on X, writing ""I am deeply sorry for these deaths"".
A statement acknowledging Quintero's death has been shared from his Facebook page, describing him as ""a man who throughout his life served those who needed it most"".
Quintero held one of 16 seats in Colombia's parliament intended to represent victims of conflict between the Marxist rebel army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), and the Colombian state.

Ecuador says ICE agent attempted to enter its Minneapolis consulate,2026-01-28T11:43:04.616Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter
Latin America editor
BBC News Online
","The government of Ecuador has condemned what it described as an attempt by a US federal immigration agent to enter the Ecuadorean consulate in Minneapolis.
The agent was prevented from gaining access by consular officials, who acted ""to guarantee the protection of the Ecuadoreans who were inside the consulate at the time"", a statement by Ecuador's foreign ministry said.
Ecuador, whose president is an ally of Trump, has filed an official complaint.
The incident comes at a time of high tension in the US city, just days after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti was shot dead by border agents during protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.
Ecuador's foreign ministry said in a statement that an agent of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) had ""tried to enter the premises of the consulate"" at 11:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday.
Under the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, consular premises are considered ""inviolable"".
According to the Convention, the authorities of the country where the consulate is located ""shall not enter"" the parts of the consulate used for work ""except with the consent of the head of the consular post"".
Ecuador said that its officials had not consented to ICE entering the consulate.
While the Vienna Convention goes on to say that consent may be assumed in certain cases, they are limited to incidents where ""prompt protective action"" is required, such as in the case of a fire or some other disaster.
In a video shared by Ecuadorean media, which has not been independently verified by the BBC, a consular official can be seen rushing to the entrance door and telling an ICE agent ""this is the consulate, you're not allowed in here"".
The agent tells the official that ""if you touch me, I will grab you"".
The consular official then states again that ""you can not enter here, this is a consulate, this is a foreign government's office"", before closing the door.
In its statement, Ecuador's foreign ministry said that it had ""immediately"" handed an official letter of protest to the US embassy in Quito.
The protest letter constitutes a rare note of discord between Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and the Trump administration.
Just over two months ago, the presidents agreed to strengthen their countries' commercial and economic relationship and Noboa has in the past thanked Trump for designating two Ecuadorean criminal gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organisations.
The actions of immigration and border agents in Minneapolis - in particular the fatal shooting of Pretti on 24 January and that of Renee Good a few weeks earlier - have triggered protests in the city and beyond.
On Tuesday, President Trump said he would ""de-escalate"" immigration and border operations ""a little bit"" in Minnesota.
There are currently 3,000 immigration agents and officers in the region.
Securing the US's borders and implementing tougher enforcement of immigration rules has been one of Trump's top priorities.
According to a 20 January statement by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, her department removed ""more than 675,000 illegal aliens"" from the US since Trump was sworn in to a second term a year ago.

Gunmen storm Mexico football pitch and kill at least 11 people,2026-01-26T11:29:26.236Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter
","At least 11 people were killed and another dozen injured when gunmen opened fire on locals who had gathered at a football pitch in the city of Salamanca in central Mexico on Sunday.
Witnesses said armed men arrived at the grounds in several vehicles and shot at those gathered there seemingly indiscriminately.
Many families had stayed behind to socialise after a match between local clubs. At least one woman and one child were among those killed.
The motive behind the shooting is not yet clear. Guanajuato, the state in which Salamanca is located, registered the highest number of murders in the whole of Mexico last year.
Neighbours reported hearing at least 100 shots ring out as the gunmen opened fire at the Cabañas pitch in the Loma de Flores neighbourhood.
Local and federal security forces are now investigating the deadly shooting.
It came just a day after several violent incidents in the city, in which a total of five men were killed and another was abducted.
Guanajuato has seen a spike in violence committed by a number of gangs that engage in the theft of oil and fuel, as well as other criminal activities such as drug trafficking and extortion.
Gang members frequently hold up tanker trucks carrying oil and tap oil pipelines belonging to state-run oil company Pemex.
Salamanca, which is home to a major Pemex refinery, has been particularly subjected to violent gang-related attacks.
Analysts say that the rivalry between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Cartel de Santa Rosa de Lima (CSRL) is behind many of the most brutal incidents.
Their criminal activities are not confined to Mexico, with both the smuggling of stolen fuel and illicit drugs spreading violence into the United States.
Last year, the US State Department designated the CJNG as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and, more recently, placed sanctions on the CSRL.
US President Donald Trump has made the fight against criminal gangs sending illicit drugs such as heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamines and cocaine one of his priorities.
He has in the past alleged that ""cartels are running Mexico"" and has threatened to hit ""narco-terrorists"" with land strikes.
The US has already carried out at least 36 strikes against vessels allegedly transporting drugs by sea, both in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing at least 125 people.
Legal experts and Trump's critics have questioned the legality of these strikes.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week handed over 37 ""high-impact"" suspects to the US in what local media described as an attempt by her government to co-operate with US counternarcotic efforts and thereby ward off the possibility of Trump ordering unilateral strikes against the cartels in Mexican territory.

Caribbean cannabis growers eye budding domestic sales and exports,2026-01-26T06:49:21.519Z," Gemma Handy
Business reporter
St John’s
Antigua
","Rub the leaf and inhale the fragrance, Michaelus Tracey is saying.
The musky scent of this cannabis plant is distinctly different from the citrusy aroma of another that he is also holding.
To the untrained eye, the neat rows of flowering cannabis crops in front of us are indistinguishable from each other.
Yet master cultivator Tracey can identify the separate varieties by their smell and the shape of their leaves.
Nine strains are being grown here at Pineapple Road, a farm deep in the countryside on the Caribbean island of Antigua. The warm temperatures, abundant sunshine, and high humidity make this prime territory for growing the plants.
Intense trials were conducted to produce the various strains, Tracey explains. ""We wanted different flavour profiles as well as different effects, but all with a medicinal value - something to help you relax, something to give you more energy, more pain relief, less anxiety.""
Last year marked a decade since Jamaica decriminalised the recreational use of cannabis and legalised its production and sale for medical reasons. Several other Caribbean nations, including the twin island country Antigua and Barbuda in 2018, have since followed suit.
Smoking cannabis is emblematic of Caribbean culture, to the extent it has become a cliché. But while the region's affection for the plant is well documented, its status as a leader in the field is less so.
Today the region is home to a plethora of legally registered cannabis farms and medicinal dispensaries, where both locals and tourists can purchase the drug if they have a valid medical authorisation card.
Yet Prof Rose-Marie Belle Antoine, an expert on the cannabis industry in the Caribbean, believes there needs to be further liberalisation.
""Decriminalisation isn't good enough,"" says Antoine, a former chair of the Caribbean Community's Regional Commission on Marijuana. ""We should just make it legal but regulated.""
Antoine is campus principal at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad, where researchers are due to start studying various potential benefits of cannabis.
Areas tipped for study range from alleviating the side effects of cancer treatment, to how the plant can boost agriculture by improving soil health. The research will take place in Antigua, where legislation is more progressive.
The work offers ""a lot of potential"", she says, but adds that legalisation would make life easier.
""The Caribbean is a leader in cannabis, in terms of strains and knowledge, and it has a long tradition of this. But legalities, the 'war on drugs' and all that nonsense, stifled not just the industry, but research and development,"" says Antoine.
Some in the region hope that US President Donald Trump's executive order in December to reclassify cannabis as a lower-level drug will benefit the Caribbean.
""It's a significant milestone,"" says Alexandra Chong, chief executive of Jamaica-based business Jacana, which sells a range of products derived from cannabis, from extract oil drops to skin cream.
""So much US public policy gets filtered down to the Caribbean,"" she says. ""Because cannabis was classified as a schedule one drug alongside heroin in the US, regulatory bodies across the Caribbean have not been as bullish with [reducing] regulation.""
Chong adds that the US reducing cannabis to the lower schedule three level, which also includes combined paracetamol-codeine tablets, was ""far more appropriate"".
The White House lowering the classification of cannabis may mean that in the future Caribbean nations can export the drug to the US for recreational use.
However, the importation of such cannabis into the US is currently still illegal under federal law. This is despite 24 US states having now legalised the use of the drug recreationally.
Producers in both Jamaica and Antigua are keen to start legally exporting the drug. Jamaica's Cannabis Licensing Authority says it ""has put in place interim administrative procedures to facilitate the export of ganja by licensees that hold a valid import permit from the country that the product will be exported to"".
Meanwhile, Antigua and Barbuda's Medicinal Cannabis Authority is working hard to develop a cannabis export industry. ""We already have the legal framework in place, a prime geographical location and an international airport,"" the body's chief executive Regis Burton tells the BBC.
He says it's ""highly likely"" that Antigua will eventually be able to export its products, not least for the novelty value. ""Very few people can say they've tried Antiguan cannabis,"" he adds.
Domestically, high overheads in both Jamaica and Antigua and Barbuda – and rules that limit the sale of cannabis to people with medical approval - are said to be leaving most of the market to illegal producers.
Jacana estimates that more than 800,000 people a year in Jamaica use cannabis, of whom half are tourists. But that 90% of the 87 tonnes of the drug consumed per annum comes through illicit channels.
Chong adds that ""over-regulation has strangled the industry. Over time it's got easier, but it's by no means perfect"".
She says that due to these problems, she estimates that of the 160-plus licences of various categories granted by Jamaica's Cannabis Licensing Authority between 2017 and 2024, ""very few"" are still in operation.
In Antigua, Robert Hill, a consultant to the industry, says: ""It's still more profitable to import cannabis illegally. Unlike dealers, private companies have staff and bills to pay.""
Currently the island has just six cannabis farms, four dispensaries and a cannabis lounge, where people can smoke on the premises. At the same time, Antiguan authorities intercepted 45kg of illegally imported cannabis in just 24 hours back in September.
Meanwhile, Antigua has been innovative in its approach to domestic illegal growers. Instead of prosecutions, violators were invited to take part in a free six-week course to teach them how to enter the market legally.
""Twenty-two have already graduated, with two soon to transition to a medicinal business,"" Burton tells the BBC. ""The industry won't be successful if the illicit market does as it pleases.""
The continuing liberalisation of cannabis across the Caribbean is also said to be having a positive impact on social justice for one community in particular.
In 2018, Antigua's Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a formal apology to the country's Rastafarians, for decades of historic persecution, stigma and abuse over their cannabis use. Six years later, the government granted Rastafarians official sacramental authorisation to grow the plants.
And last summer, it announced plans to expunge the criminal records of people previously prosecuted for possession of small amounts of marijuana.
But for High Priest Selah, of Antigua's Nyabinghi denomination of Rastafarians, memories of the harassment he and others once suffered still linger.
""The police were always coming and locking us up, destroying our plants, tarnishing our name and embarrassing us in public,"" he recalls. Campaigners from his community played a major role in getting the plant decriminalised.
Back at Pineapple Road, two employees are carefully hand-rolling joints, each one containing a gram of pure marijuana, for sale in the company's dispensary.
Burton hopes more local growers will get on board and keep the industry's proceeds in Caribbean hands.
Hill agrees. ""We have the ability to compete with much bigger countries thanks to our climate which reduces costs,"" he says, adding: ""We're not trying to create an Amsterdam, this is about wellness.""

"Venezuela frees dozens of political prisoners, human rights group says",2026-01-25T18:29:57.356Z," Thomas Mackintosh
","A leading Venezuelan human rights group says at least 80 political prisoners have been released under pressure from the US.
Alfredo Romero, head of Foro Penal, said his group was verifying the identities of those freed from prisons across the country on Saturday - and more releases were likely to take place.
It is the latest batch of detainees released since the US seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a raid, and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges earlier this month.
On Friday Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez said more than 600 prisoners had been freed - but Foro Penal says this figure has been inflated.
Romero announced the releases on social media. He also posted an image of Foro Penal colleague Kennedy Tejeda who he said had been held in Tocorón prison, west of the capital caracas since August 2024.
In a post on X, Foro Penal lawyer Gonzalo Himiob said the number of releases could rise above 80 ""as we proceed with verification"".
Previously, Foro Penal said that many of those freed in recent weeks have not had the charges against them dropped.
This has left them in legal limbo and they have been barred from speaking in public, the group said.
Before this weekend's developments, the group had confirmed the release of just 156 political prisoners since 8 January.
Some domestic opposition figures and at least five Spanish nationals are among those confirmed to have been freed so far.
Separately, Rodriguez said she was due to have a call on Monday with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, to ask the UN to verify the lists of those released so far.
Human rights groups and activists have long accused the government of using detentions to muzzle critics. The Venezuelan government has denied holding political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.
Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, when Maduro claimed victory despite opponents and many countries disputing the results.

"Son-in-law of Venezuelan opposition candidate freed from jail, wife says",2026-01-22T11:35:20.453Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter

BBC News Online
","Rafael Tudares, the son-in-law of Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González, has been released from prison, his wife has said, more than a year after he was detained as part of a crackdown on Maduro government critics and their relatives.
Mariana González said her husband had returned home after ""380 days of unjust and arbitrary detention"".
Tudares is one of more than 150 detainees who have been released since the US military seized Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, in a nighttime raid and took him to New York to stand trial on drug-trafficking charges.
An NGO lobbying for the release of Venezuelan political prisoners warns that 777 still remain behind bars.
Tension within the country remains high with Maduro's former vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, now in power having been sworn in as the acting president.
Her interim government has received the backing of US President Donald Trump, who has praised Rodríguez for agreeing to ""turn over"" up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the US.
The release of political prisoners had been among the first things the Trump administration had pushed Venezuela's interim government to do.
Just five days after the US raid, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that ""an important number of people"" would be freed as ""a gesture of peace"".
However, rights groups have denounced the slow pace of the releases and the fact that the number given by officials - 400 - falls far short of what they have been able to confirm.
The NGO Foro Penal says it has so far only been able to verify the release of 151 political prisoners since 8 January, when the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that ""an important number of people"" would be freed as ""a gesture of peace"" following the US operation.
Foro Penal has also said that many those released have not had the charges against them dropped, leaving them in legal limbo, and have been barred from speaking in public.
Tudares's imprisonment was one of the emblematic cases of the repression which followed in the wake of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election.
His father-in-law, González, became the main challenger of the incumbent Maduro after the well-known opposition leader María Corina Machado was barred from running.
Fearing the Maduro government would resort to fraud to rig the result, González and Machado mobilised hundreds of people to act as observers at the polling stations and collect the tallies from the electronic voting machines.
The electoral council, dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner but never provided the detailed voting tallies to back up its claim.
The voting tallies collected by the observers deployed by the opposition and independently verified by the Carter Center, however, suggested that González had won by a landslide.
Nevertheless, Maduro - who was firmly in control of the state institutions, including the armed forces and the police - was sworn in for another term in January 2025.
In the run-up to his inauguration, many opposition leaders and activists were seized by the security forces in an attempt to stifle any dissent.
Fearing arrest, González had sought refuge in the Dutch embassy as early as September 2024 and gone in to exile in Spain shortly afterwards.
Three days before Maduro's inauguration, González's 46-year-old son-in-law - a lawyer who was not involved in politics - was seized by hooded men as he was taking his young children to see their ailing grandmother.
For months, his family did not know where he was being held or on what grounds he had been seized.
Last month, his wife said she had learned that he had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for ""terrorism and conspiracy"". She said her access was not allowed to choose a lawyer and had only been allowed to read the charges levelled against him on the day of his ""only hearing"".
Mariana González told El Pais newspaper that she had been approached on at least three occasions by middlemen who told her that her husband would only be allowed to return to his family if her father renounced his cause.
""This has nothing to do with justice,"" she said at the time. ""Being the son-in-law of Edmundo González is not a crime,"" she added.
Mariana González took to X to thank all of the people who had supported her in her fight for her husband's release.
But she also reminded readers that there were still many families waiting for the release of their loved ones who, she said, had been ""forcibly disappeared, arbitrarily detained and unjustly locked up.
Many of them have been holding vigils outside the main prisons in Venezuela in the hope that their relatives will be among those released in the wake of the US military raid.

Colombia sentences ex-paramilitary leader Mancuso to 40 years in jail,2026-01-20T16:39:01.284Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter
","A tribunal in Colombia has sentenced a former paramilitary leader, Salvatore Mancuso, to 40 years in prison for murders and forced disappearances committed at the height of the country's armed conflict.
Mancuso was a commander in the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing paramilitary group originally created to defend landowners from attacks by Marxist guerrilla groups, which became involved in drug trafficking.
The tribunal found that under his command, AUC members committed more than 100 crimes in La Guajira povince between 2002 and 2006.
Mancuso was sent back to Colombia in 2024 after serving a 15-year prison sentence in the US for drug trafficking.
The 61-year-old was sentenced on Monday by a special tribunal created to deal with cases arising from Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which at least 450,000 people were killed between 1985 and 2018 according to figures compiled by a truth commission.
The tribunal said that Mancuso's 40-year-long sentence could be reduced to eight years if he agreed to work with the transitional justice and took part in reparation activities.
Mancuso's name became a byword for the atrocities committed by AUC groups in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The tribunal said that under his leadership the AUC had targeted members of the indigenous Wayuu group who live in La Guajira, in the far north of Colombia.
It documented 117 crimes, including murders, forced disappearances and gender violence, committed by the AUC in the area.
Indigenous groups were often caught in between warring factions of Colombia's armed conflict.
Marxist rebel groups forcibly recruited many indigenous children into their ranks, holding them against their will in rebel camps where they had to perform chores and were sometimes forced to fight.
The AUC and other paramilitary groups, which suspected the indigenous groups of siding with the rebels, drove them off their land and waged a campaign of terror and intimidation against them.
The AUC negotiated a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2005 but offshoots of the group refused to lay down arms and became even more heavily involved in the trafficking of drugs, which they had already been engaging in to raise funds for their fight against the guerrilla.
Mancuso was extradited to the US in 2008, where he was put on trial on drug trafficking charges.
He was sentenced in 2015, after having been found guilty of smuggling large quantities of cocaine into the US ""to arm a paramilitary force of more than 30,000 fighters and cement his control over regions of Colombia"", the US justice department said at the time.
After he had served his sentence in the US, Mancuso, a dual Colombian and Italian national, asked to be allowed to move to Italy. But his request was denied and he was deported to Colombia.
There, he offered to provide testimony into how Colombian politicians, business leaders and other members of the country's establishment allegedly cooperated with the AUC.
Pleased with his offer of co-operation, the government of Colombian President Gustavo Petro named Mancuso a ""promoter of peace"", saying he would act as a mediator between the administration and illegal armed groups still active in the country.
The move was vehemently criticised by human rights groups who pointed to the atrocities his group carried out under his command.

Chile declares 'state of catastrophe' as wildfires leave at least 18 dead,2026-01-19T03:30:31.161Z," Henri Astier
","Chilean President Gabriel Boric has declared a state of catastrophe in two regions where deadly wildfires have left at least 18 people dead.
More than 50,000 people have also been evacuated in the Ñuble and Biobío regions, about 500km (300 miles) south of the capital Santiago.
Boric said the death toll was expected to increase.
The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said.
Local media have shown pictures of charred cars in the streets.
Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío.
The fires have burnt through 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) in the two regions so far.
""In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe"" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X.
""All resources are available,"" he added.
Under a state of catastrophe, Chile's armed forces can be deployed to help.
The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000.
Strong winds have fanned the flames, exacerbated by high summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts.
Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the coming days.
Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought.
Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.

Machado vows to lead Venezuela 'when right time comes',2026-01-16T19:01:45.375Z," Maia Davies
BBC News
","Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed she will lead the country ""when the right time comes"".
""There's a mission, and we are going to turn Venezuela into that land of grace, and I believe I will be elected when the right time comes as president of Venezuela, the first woman president,"" she told Fox News.
Her comments come a day after she gave President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom.
The US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on 3 January and removed him to New York to face various drugs and weapons charges.
However, Trump has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, saying she did not have enough domestic support - despite her opposition movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections.
He has instead been dealing with the country's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's vice-president and who on Friday held a two-hour meeting with the director of the CIA ""at President Trump's direction"" aimed at building trust and communication between the two countries, according to a US official.
""Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries,"" the US official said.
Asked on Friday about his decision to work with Rodríguez over Machado, Trump told reporters his decision had been informed by the US experience in Iraq more than 20 years ago.
Security and political structures were dismantled after the US invaded, setting the scene for insurgency and the eventual emergence of the Islamic State group.
""If you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired - every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired - and they ended up being ISIS... I remember that,"" he said.
Speaking later at an event in Washington, Machado said she was confident there would be an ""orderly transition"" in her country.
""The result of a stable transition will be a proud Venezuela that will be the best ally the US has ever had in the Americas,"" she said.
""This has nothing to do with a tension between Delcy Rodríguez and myself, this is about a criminal structure - that is the regime - and the Venezuelan people,"" she added, describing herself as ""just one member of a movement of millions of Venezuelans"".
Meanwhile, in Venezuela's capital Caracas, Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president.
She said she was not afraid to face the US ""diplomatically, through political dialogue"".
Rodríguez also said Venezuela needed to defend its ""dignity and honour"", and announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment in a step away from Maduro's policies.
Trump called Rodríguez a ""terrific person"" on Wednesday after the pair spoke on the phone, a conversation the Venezuelan leader called ""productive and courteous"".
The following day, the US president called Machado a ""wonderful woman who has been through so much"", describing her gift of the Nobel Peace Prize medal as a ""wonderful gesture of mutual respect"".

Cuba counts cost of alliance after 32 troops killed in Venezuela,2026-01-16T02:49:01.984Z," Will Grant
BBC's Cuba correspondent in Havana
","From sunrise, throngs of military personnel, government officials and civilians lined the route between Havana's airport and the Armed Forces Ministry to applaud home the remains of 32 Cuban troops killed in Venezuela as they passed by in a funeral cortege.
The country's leadership – from Raul Castro to President Miguel Diaz Canel – were at the airport to receive the boxes carrying the cremated ashes of their ""32 fallen heroes"".
In the lobby of the ministry building, each box was draped in a Cuban flag and set next to a photograph of the respective soldier or intelligence officer beneath the words ""honour and glory"".
But despite the pomp and full military honours, this has been a chastening experience for the Cuban Revolution.
First, it is believed to be the biggest loss of Cuban combatants at the hands of the US military since the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. The fact that six-and-a-half decades have passed with barely a comparable firefight between Cuban and US troops, either during the Cold War or afterwards, shows how rare it is.
It is not necessarily surprising that the better-trained and better-equipped Delta Force soldiers emerged virtually unscathed, especially given their elite reputation within the most powerful military in the world.
But that is of no comfort to the grieving family members as they tearfully placed their hands on the wooden boxes in Havana.
Furthermore, in the days after the US military intervention in Venezuela and the forced removal of Nicolas Maduro from power, the Cuban Government was obliged to admit something it had long denied: the very existence of Cuban intelligence officers inside the corridors of power in Caracas.
It is now clear, as it had been claimed for years by many in Venezuela, that Cubans have been present at every level of the country's security apparatus and that the bilateral intelligence arrangements were a crucial part of Cuba-Venezuela ties.
In short, the Cuban Government has shared its years of experience of how best to maintain an iron grip on power with its Venezuelan partners. The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy.
In the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as ""a terrific person"".
Rewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of ""narco-terrorists.""
It seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela.
Washington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution.
However, one of its ""original generation"" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.
He led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt:
""If the US tries to invade, they'll stir up a hornets' nest"" he said, quoting Raul Castro. ""They'd never even see our combatants coming, men and women.""
""If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won't be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela"", he says. ""Out here, things would be very different.""
In the past few days, Cuban state television has shown images of civilian reservists receiving weapons training from the Cuban military.
In truth, pitted against the US military, it would be an uneven fight. The US attack on Venezuela was intended, in part, to underscore that point to the region.
The stakes for Cuba are particularly high.
The island is experiencing widespread blackouts which are bad in Havana but much worse in the provinces. The economy, battered by the US economic embargo and by government mismanagement, is limping along at best. Fuel is scarce and the motor of the economy, tourism, has never recovered to its pre-pandemic levels.
It's into that already-complex picture that Cubans are trying to imagine the near total loss of Venezuelan support. It feels to most like a bleak scenario.
But former-commander, Victor Dreke, is adamant that Cuba has ridden out tough times before and can do so again with enough revolutionary fervour.
Cuba doesn't want any conflict with Trump administration, he insists, and won't be looking to escalate matters with Washington.
""But that doesn't mean we won't be ready"", he adds, defiantly.

US forces seize a sixth Venezuela-linked oil tanker in Caribbean Sea,2026-01-15T20:09:34.463Z," Brajesh UpadhyayandNatalie Sherman
","The US has seized a sixth tanker in the Caribbean Sea in its ongoing efforts to control exports of Venezuelan oil, officials say.
The vessel, Veronica, was boarded in a predawn operation ""without incident"" as it was defying President Donald Trump's ""quarantine of sanctioned vessels"", said the US military.
""The only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully,"" the Southern Command said.
Since the US military strikes on Venezuela and seizure of its president Nicolás Maduro this month, Trump has said he plans to tap into the country's huge oil reserves.
""The Veronica is the latest tanker operating in defiance of President Trump's established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean,"" US Southern Command said in a post on social media.
It also posted a video showing Marines and sailors boarding the tanker.
Veronica, a crude oil tanker sailing under a Guyanese flag, departed empty from Venezuelan waters in early January, according to monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.
The International Maritime Organization's database shows the vessel was previously registered in Russia under different names.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on social media that Thursday's tanker seizure was carried out with ""close coordination with our colleagues"" in the military as well as the state and justice departments.
""Our heroic Coast Guard men and women once again ensured a flawlessly executed operation, in accordance with international law,"" Noem added.
It suggests Washington's crackdown on the so-called dark fleet, comprising more than 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned oil, will continue as the US works with Venezuela's interim government to control the country's oil sales.
It also comes a day after an American official said the US had completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500m (£373m).
Trump last week asked oil executives at the White House to invest $100bn in Venezuela's energy infrastructure. They said significant changes would be needed make the country an attractive investment.
The blockade has sharply curtailed Venezuelan oil exports, with only ships associated with Chevron and bound for the US operating as usual, according to Matt Smith, head of US analysis at Kpler.
Loadings have fallen roughly in half this month to about 400,000 barrels per day, he said.
The Veronica, a relatively small tanker with a sanctioned owner, was among about 17 ships that attempted to breach the blockade earlier this month, according to the firm.
Smith said it was unclear why vessels from the so-called dark fleet would risk seizure, but noted the financial cost of delays. ""If a tanker was supposed to be moving crude and can't get through, that's money lost,"" he said.
He said the US quarantine had created a bottleneck of supply that would otherwise be headed to countries, mainly China.
But as the US starts selling Venezuelan oil, he said there were signs the situation was evolving with some tankers now headed to the Bahamas for storage.
The latest tanker seizure came just hours ahead of a meeting between Trump and Venezuela's opposition leader Maria Corina Machado at the White House.
Trump has previously described her as a ""freedom fighter"", but rejected the notion of appointing her to lead Venezuela after Maduro's removal, arguing that she lacks sufficient domestic backing. He instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.
Trump describes Rodríguez as an ""ally"", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.
Machado is expected to use her face time with Trump to try to persuade him that his decision to back Rodríguez's interim government is a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition.

A Venezuelan government envoy, too, is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps towards reopening the country's embassy, the New York Times reported.
""The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of the interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, who has been described as ""extremely co-operative"" by the White House.
On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the $500m energy deal was struck in large part because of help from Rodriguez.
She said the interim president had also confirmed that Venezuela would be releasing political prisoners from Venezuela.
""There were five Americans who were recently released this week as well,"" Leavitt said.
""So, the president likes what he's seeing. And we'll expect that co-operation to continue.""

Bodies of Cubans killed during US raid on Venezuela returned,2026-01-15T14:10:03.976Z," Will Grant
Cuba correspondent reporting from Havana
","The bodies of 32 Cuban soldiers and security personnel killed during the US military intervention in Venezuela have arrived in Cuba for formal military ceremonies and burials.
The Venezuelan government says more than 100 people were killed in the country during the US raid on its capital, Caracas, on 3 January.
The Cubans were working as protection officers for the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, when he was forcibly removed from Venezuelan soil and taken to New York to face drug trafficking charges.
The soldiers' remains will be received with military honours and taken to the Ministry of the Armed Forces in the capital, Havana, where the public can pay their respects.
Events will then be held in municipalities across the island, and a protest is due to take place outside the US embassy on Friday before the bodies are interred.
Many of those killed were tasked with protecting Maduro when US Delta Force troops entered his compound.
It is believed to be the largest number of Cuban combatants killed by the US military since the Bay of Pigs invasion - a failed attempt to overthrow former leader Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba - in 1961.
Venezuela is a long-standing ally of Cuba.
Following the recent US action, US President Donald Trump has maintained pressure on the Cuban government, saying that the country is ""ready to fall"".
He has said that the interim government of Delcy Rodríguez in Venezuela would no longer be sending oil to Cuba - something that would represent a huge blow to the communist-run nation.
Cuba is in the grips of an acute economic and energy crisis and can ill afford to lose its most important benefactor of the past 25 years.
The Cuban government has vowed to continue to resist against pressure and the economic embargo from Washington.
However, Cubans are worried about what a deepening conflict with the US will mean for the basics – such as keeping the lights on in the country and obtaining food amid widespread scarcity.

She's offered to share her Nobel with Trump. But what might Machado ask for in return?,2026-01-15T12:32:12.666Z," Norberto Paredes
BBC Mundo
Caracas
","Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado may hold the Nobel Peace Prize, but she knows there is only one foreign endorsement that really matters: Donald Trump's.
She will meet the US president at the White House on Thursday, after publicly offering to share her Nobel with him - a prize he has long coveted.
Trump has said it would be an ""honour"" to accept the award, although the Norwegian Nobel Institute said legally it is not possible to transfer the prize. Previously, Trump had criticised the Nobel committee for bypassing him and giving Machado the award.
Largely, he has appeared cool towards Machado, who was given the award in recognition of her long fight for democracy in Venezuela. In 2023, she won the opposition primary by a landslide, and was barred from running against Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election a year later was widely condemned as illegitimate.
Yet after a US operation ousted Maduro earlier this month, Trump backed Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, saying Machado was ""not respected"" enough to lead the country.
For her part, Rodríguez said at her first press conference as interim president on Wednesday that Venezuela was entering a ""new political era"" marked by greater tolerance for ""ideological and political diversity.""
Machado will be hoping to use her face time with the US president on Thursday to persuade him that his decision to back Rodríguez's interim government is a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition.
When BBC Mundo spoke to Machado after her most recent conversation with Trump – before the US intervened in Venezuela on 3 January – she told me that she thanked him for what he was doing ""for peace, freedom, and democracy"", insisting that together they would ""liberate"" Venezuela.
But immediately after the US operation, Trump announced that he planned to ""run"" Venezuela himself and that he was content to keep Rodríguez's interim government in place, saying that she was ""essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again"".
On Wednesday, Trump told reporters he had a ""great conversation"" with Rodríguez and praised her as being a ""terrific person"" following a long phone call.
Could a meeting between Machado and Trump in the Oval Office change all that?
Trump is famously unpredictable in his personal relationships with other politicians, but how he sees Machado's role is likely to depend less on what she says than on what Rodríguez does in the coming weeks, and whether it meets Trump's approval.
While many opposition supporters were shocked when Trump sidelined Machado in favour of Rodríguez, some are now beginning to understand what may have been behind that decision.
Machado is a polarising figure. Though loved by her supporters - who, among other things, admire her skill in uniting a previously fragmented opposition - she is hated by the regime and its loyalists for that very same reason. To them, she is a formidable and above all, outspoken opponent.
While the government now commands only minority popular support, according to polls and analysts, it retains firm control over the state's institutions, including the military.
Armed civilian groups known as colectivos, financed by the state, remain an integral part of the pro-government movement.
In this political and security climate, expressing public support for Machado, or for US intervention, is fraught with risk.
Even some of Maduro's opponents fear what could happen if Trump was to install an opposition leader without holding fresh elections.
Venezuelans are divided on Trump's actions – even among those who opposed Maduro.
While some whisper support, others take particular issue with his statements suggesting that the US could control Venezuela and its oil.
The division over who should lead the country is deeper still.
Many Venezuelans admire Machado and recognise her as the only opposition leader who maintained a coherent and consistent challenge to Maduro's government.
Here in Caracas, some people have told the BBC that, contrary to Trump's claim, she enjoys strong support within the country.
They point to her landslide victory in the opposition primary ahead of the 2024 presidential election and her ability to mobilise thousands of Venezuelans to protest when Maduro declared victory in the election, even though independently verified tallies showed the candidate backed by Machado had won.
That group views Rodríguez as one of the architects of Maduro's government and its abuses.
They will want Machado to press Trump at the White House on how the US plans to ""run"" Venezuela and to try and convince him that, while his promise to ""Make Venezuela Great Again"" by controlling the country's oil industry may appeal to some US Maga supporters, it does little to restore democracy.
Others, however, agree with Trump and believe Rodríguez should oversee the transition. They view her as the best option to avoid the instability that could be triggered by a backlash from supporters of the current government and the colectivos.
They would not welcome the opposition taking power after a US military operation in which Maduro was captured and sent to New York to face drug trafficking and arms charges.
The army and the colectivos are currently unlikely to take orders from the opposition and, at least in the short term, some feel the status quo is safer.
A prominent Venezuelan political analyst – who did not want to be named – told the BBC that many people believe Trump's ability to overthrow Maduro was made possible largely because of Machado's efforts to weaken the regime.
""Personally, I doubt that Trump fully believes what he said. If he truly thought Machado lacked support in Venezuela, why would he host her at the White House?"" he said.
""More than 80% of Venezuelans want political change,"" he adds. ""They believe the opposition are the only ones capable of overseeing a process of returning to democracy in Venezuela.
""And most of those Venezuelans who want change do not believe it would happen under Delcy Rodríguez.""

","The son of a jailed Venezuelan opposition leader has warned Donald Trump to ""not be fooled"" by the country's government, amid accusations it has not kept its promise to release a significant number of political prisoners.
Ramón Guanipa, the son of Juan Pablo Guanipa, said he believed the US president was unaware that only about 40 releases out of more than 800 political prisoners had reportedly been confirmed so far.
On Saturday, Trump thanked the Venezuelan authorities, saying they had ""started the process, in a BIG WAY"".
The Venezuelan government announced on Thursday it would release detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups as a ""goodwill gesture"".
The move came after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on 3 January, and took him to New York, where he has been charged with drug trafficking.
Jorge Rodríguez, Venezuela's National Assembly leader and the brother of Interim President Delcy Rodríguez, announced that an ""important number of Venezuelan and foreign detainees"" would be released ""immediately"".
On Monday, the government said more than 100 such prisoners had already been released - a number far greater than the figure so far confirmed by human rights campaigners.
Among those who are confirmed to have been released are several high-profile opposition figures - with Spain's foreign ministry confirming that five Spanish citizens had been freed, including human rights lawyer Rocío San Miguel.
Trump claimed credit for the releases, writing on social media on Saturday: ""I hope these prisoners will remember how lucky they got that the USA came along and did what had to be done.""
But relatives of those still behind bars have been expressing their frustration that only a small number of prisoners have been freed.
Ramón Guanipa, whose father is a close ally of opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado, told BBC Mundo: ""I want to tell President Trump that he must not be fooled and [should] keep pressure on these guys.""
He added: ""I want to thank President Trump for the pressure that he's been enforcing. He's been our greatest ally in this situation.""
However, pointing to the small number of people released so far, Guanipa warned Trump that ""if he thinks this is going alright, it is not"".
Ramón Guanipa says he has only been allowed to visit his father once since the older man was arrested.
Juan Pablo Guanipa went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the result of the 2024 presidential election. That vote was lacked ""basic transparency and integrity"", according to the UN, and was denounced as rigged by the US which did not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader.
For his comments, Juan Pablo Guanipa was tracked down by Venezuelan security forces and detained in May 2025.
After hearing about the planned prisoner release, Ramón Guanipa took the first available flight from Maracaibo, in the west of the country, to Caracas.
""When they tell you they're going to release your family, everything else becomes small,"" he explained.
But when his father was not among those freed, he felt ""defeated"".
""But at the same time, you find another reason to fight. I'm fighting for them [the interim government] to actually do what they say they're going to do.""
The Venezuelan government has not commented on the pace of the releases, and the attorney general has declined a BBC interview request.
The developments are being viewed as the first test of Trump's influence in Venezuela following the removal of Maduro.
Interim President Delcy Rodríguez has appeared to welcome co-operation with the Trump administration, but her public statements have condemned any form of US intervention.
The government's announcement about prisoner releases came a day after Trump said that the Venezuelan authorities would shut down El Helicoide, the country's most notorious prison.
El Helicoide was originally designed to be a shopping centre and a symbol of Venezuela's oil-fuelled prosperity, but became a fortress of political repression under Maduro.
Outside El Helicoide in western Caracas, the atmosphere is tense, with relatives keeping vigil.
Carmen Farfán's son, José Gregorio Reyes, was detained along with his wife and a friend, while he was in hospital in western Venezuela. Their families have heard nothing since.
Farfán does not know where her son is being held but has come to El Helicoide to join others in pleading for their relatives' release - wherever they may be.
Beside her, Reyes' sister-in-law, cries as she describes how the three were arrested in November 2025.
""We hope they tell us where they are keeping them. We are desperate. We've been waiting for many days without any answers,"" Farfán says.
Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have long accused the government of using detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics, but officials repeatedly denied Venezuela held any political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for criminal activity.
Opposition activists have described the release of political prisoners as an ""urgent"" step towards any transition of power.
However, the small number freed so far has raised doubts about the interim government's intentions and questions over the extent of its willingness to cooperate with the US.

Five severed heads displayed on Ecuador beach,2026-01-12T12:30:04.762Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter
","Bathers found five severed heads displayed on a beach in Ecuador in what appears to be a warning to gang members who have been threatening local fishermen.
The gruesome discovery was made on Sunday on the beachfront in Puerto López, a town which has been wracked by gang violence.
Next to the body parts, locals found a sign threatening those stealing from and extorting fishermen with the same fate.
Ports and towns by the Pacific Ocean are among those worst hit by gangs which smuggle cocaine from Ecuador to the US and Europe.
Police have identified the remains as those of five men who had been reported missing days earlier. They ranged between 20 and 34 years in age.
Officials told local media one of them had a criminal record for gun possession.
Their bodies have not yet been located.
According to figures released by the interior ministry, 2025 was the most violent on record in Ecuador, with homicide rates reaching an all-time high at 9,176 murders.
Ecuador - which is located between Colombia and the Peru, the world's two largest producers of cocaine - has become a key transit country for illegal drugs.
Local gangs have forged alliances with powerful Mexican and Colombian drug cartels, counternarcotics experts say.
As well as smuggling drugs, the criminal gangs force local businesses to pay ""protection money"" and attack those who refuse.
On 28 December, six people - including a two-year-old child - were killed and another three injured when gunmen opened fire at a group of people standing on the beachfront in Puerto López.
Police said the shooting and another the previous day, in which another three people were killed, were triggered by a battle for control of the town between two rival factions of the Los Choneros gang.
Los Choneros is one of the main drivers of the deadly gang violence which has rocked Ecuador.
In September, the US state department added the group to its list of Foreign Terrorist Organisations.
Its leader, known as Fito, was extradited to the United States in July of last year.

US calls Argentina peso bet a 'homerun deal',2026-01-09T17:39:08.949Z," Natalie Sherman
Business reporter
","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said his risky US gamble on Argentina's currency has paid off.
Bessent said American financial support had been repaid and the US no longer held any Argentine pesos in its exchange stabilisation fund.
The US had purchased the then-plunging currency last year in an effort to stave off further turmoil and boost the party of President Javier Milei, a key ally of President Donald Trump, in the run-up to national midterm elections.
The move sparked criticism from Democrats, who accused Bessent of risking taxpayer money on a country with a long history of financial turmoil.
In the end, Bessent said the manoeuvre had been a success.
""Stabilising a strong American ally – and making tens of millions in profit for Americans – is an America First homerun deal,"" he wrote in an announcement on social media.
When the US moved to intervene in September, people were dumping the peso, mindful of the shocks they had experienced after previous elections and rattled by signs that Milei's party might experience an upset in the mid-terms.
Bessent promised to do ""what was needed"" to stave off further drops in September. He announced a month later that the US had purchased pesos and agreed to extend a swap line to Argentina, allowing the country to exchange pesos for dollars.
The move helped to halt the falls in the currency, which saw further gains after Milei's party clinched a landslide victory in the mid-term elections, though it has drifted lower more recently.
Argentina's central bank said it settled the swap line in December. It ultimately traded just $2.5bn in pesos for dollars of a possible $20bn, according to a government report on deal.
The report said the US had also separately provided $872m in support involving reserves held at the IMF.
The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that transaction.
""Getting your money back is a straight forward definition of a success,"" said Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, even if he said tens of millions in profit was ""small change"" given the sums involved.
But he said big challenges continue to face the Argentine economy, given how much it spent last year from its reserves to prop up the currency.
""It's been a short term success - Bessent got his money back,"" he said. ""I do remain worried that the Argentines are relying too heavily on the expectation that Secretary Bessent will ride to the rescue ... and therefore aren't showing enough urgency in their plans to rebuild their own reserves.""

The continued mysteries surrounding the intelligence operation to seize Maduro,2026-01-09T14:39:15.833Z," Gordon Corera
Security analyst
","A week on from the dramatic raid that seized Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, details of the intelligence surrounding the operation are becoming clearer, but some mysteries still remain.
The mission took months of planning and intelligence gathering. In August the CIA is believed to have sent a team of undercover officers into Venezuela.
The US does not have a functioning embassy in the country, so the team could not use diplomatic cover and were working in what is known in the intelligence worlds as a ""denied area"". They were on the ground to scout targets and recruit people who could help.
US officials have said they had one particular source who was able to provide detailed intelligence on Maduro's whereabouts which would have been critical to the operation.
Identities of such sources are normally highly protected but it quickly emerged it was a ""government"" source who must have been particularly close to Maduro and in his inner circle in order to know where he was going to be, and when.
That has led to intense speculation about who it was and what has happened to them. But their identity is still not public.
All of the human intelligence on the ground fed into a ""mosaic"" of intelligence to plan the operation in conjunction with technical intelligence like mapping and satellite imagery.
The scale, speed and success of the operation were unprecedented.
""This thing worked like clockwork. That doesn't happen often,"" explains David Fitzgerald, a former Latin America Chief of Operations for the CIA who also worked on planning missions with the US military.
""It is not the military tactics that drive the operation, but the intelligence.""
Around 150 aircraft were involved in the mission, with helicopters flying only a hundred or so feet above the terrain to get to Maduro's compound.
There are still some mysteries though. One is exactly how the US turned off the lights in Caracas in order to enable the special forces to arrive.
""The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have - it was dark and it was deadly,"" US President Donald Trump said.
The fact that the US Cyber Command was publicly thanked for its role in the operation has led to speculation that US military hackers got inside Venezuelan networks in advance to shut the grid down at the right moment - but details are limited.
The failure of Chinese and Russian air defences has also led to speculation of what kind of jamming or electronic warfare technology was deployed by the US in the air to aid the operation. The US Space Command, which operates satellites, also received credit for creating a ""pathway"" for the special forces to enter unseen.
Stealth drones were also thought to have been deployed. Exact details of the capabilities used are likely to remain secret, but America's adversaries will be doing their best to try and understand what happened.
Those who have planned complex operations say it is remarkable that everything went according to plan, something that does not usually happen. One helicopter was hit but was still able to fly and no US forces were killed.
There are still few details about the battle that took place at Maduro's compound, Fuerte Tiuna.
The Cuban government said that 32 of its nationals were killed by US forces. These were bodyguards provided to defend Maduro by its ally, Cuba. The Caribbean country provides not just bodyguards, but wider security support to the regime.
""Within the immediate perimeter of Maduro, there were probably zero Venezuelan security officers and on the outer perimeter maybe a mixture of both,"" says Fitzgerald.
The fact that they proved so ineffective has also led to questions about whether some elements of the regime facilitated the mission in some way.
US forces were also able to get to Maduro as he was trying to lock himself into a steel safe room but before he could close the door.
They had blowtorches and explosives ready to blow the door open if needed, but the speed of the apprehension again suggests an incredibly detailed understanding of the layout of the compound.
The CIA undertook a classified assessment in advance of the operation, looking at what might happen if Maduro was removed.
The analysts examined a series of options and, according to reports, came to the view that working with elements of the existing regime offered more chance for stability than trying to install the opposition in exile in power. That helped solidify the view that the US should work with Delcy Rodríguez the vice-president.
There are thought to have been back-channel, secret contacts with elements of the Maduro regime in advance of the operation to discuss how people might position themselves given different potential outcomes.
The exact detail of those remain mysterious but they likely do much to explain why the mission took place, why it was successful and also what the plan is next.

Venezuelan government begins releasing political prisoners,2026-01-09T10:18:09.435Z," Will Grant
Central America correspondentandOlivia Ireland
","The Venezuelan government has started releasing detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups, in what officials described as a goodwill gesture.
Spain's foreign ministry said five of its nationals had been released. Among them is prominent Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist, Rocío San Miguel, her family confirmed to US media.
The move comes after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that the release of political prisoners - which has been a long-held US demand - was ""a very important and smart gesture"" from Venezuela.
Trump added that Venezuela released the prisoners as a sign of ""seeking peace"" and as a result, he had cancelled a ""previously expected second wave of attacks"" on the country.
Jorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that ""a significant number"" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed.
Hundreds of political prisoners are detained in Venezuelan prisons, with only a handful thought to have been released so far.
Jorge Rodríguez said the interim government was releasing them in the interest of ""national unity and peaceful coexistence"".
Rocío San Miguel, a vocal critic of Maduro and a defence expert, was the first prisoner confirmed to be freed. Her family told the New York Times that she was taken to the Spanish embassy in Caracas.
Arrested in 2024, she was accused of being involved in a plot to kill the then-president and faced charges of treason, conspiracy and terrorism. Her arrest shocked human rights activists and, because her whereabouts were unknown, was labelled as potential ""enforced disappearance"" by the UN Human Rights Office.
Venezuelan human rights organisations - some of which have members or their founders in jail - welcomed the news with caution.
Despite being a key lieutenant of Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez's interim administration has appeared willing to co-operate with the US since it took its leader and made sweeping declarations about the South American nation's future.
About 50 to 80 prisoners are believed to be held at the notorious El Helicoide prison, which US President Donald Trump announced would be closed following Maduro's capture.
The prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents, with reports by human rights groups of torture including beatings and electrocution.
The announcement also comes shortly after US President Donald Trump stated that he had ""given orders to close that prison,"" which had become one of the most notorious symbols of political repression in the country.
Venezuelan human rights group Provea warned El Helicoide's anticipated closure should not deflect attention from the other detention sites still running across the country.
Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies in prison, has repeatedly demanded releases.
In a sit-down interview with the Fox News show Hannity, Trump said Machado was expected to come to the US ""next week sometime"".
Machado told host Sean Hannity earlier in the week that she wanted to give the US president her Nobel Peace Prize. When asked by Hannity whether Trump would accept the offer, he said ""that would be a great honour"".
Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years the government used detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics.
Since the widely disputed 2024 election, the opposition claimed legal proceedings against activists, journalists and political adversaries increased.
Attorney General Tarek Saab and others in the government repeatedly denied Venezuela held political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for genuine crimes.

Analysis: Why Trump chose Maduro's VP over Nobel winner,2026-01-08T04:20:37.030Z," Paul Adams
Diplomatic correspondent
","Amid the many questions swirling since last weekend's dramatic events in Caracas – and there are many – one that refuses to go away centres on the bespectacled woman now leading what US officials are calling Venezuela's ""interim authorities"".
Why Delcy?
What is it about Delcy Rodríguez, daughter of a former Marxist guerilla and deputy to ousted dictator Nicolas Maduro, that has caught the eye of the Trump administration?
And why has Washington decided on an avowed ""Chavista"" revolutionary to stay in power, rather than backing the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, whose opposition movement is widely believed to have won the 2024 presidential elections?
The answer, according to one former US ambassador to Venezuela, is simple.
""They've gone for stability over democracy,"" says Charles Shapiro, who served as George W Bush's ambassador in Caracas from 2002-04.
""They've kept the dictatorial regime in place without the dictator. The henchmen are still there.
""I think it's risky as hell.""
But the alternative, involving wholesale regime change and backing Machado's opposition movement, would have involved other dangers, including potential infighting among opposition figures and the alienation of those Venezuelans – perhaps as many as 30% – who voted for Maduro.
In his dramatic news conference on Saturday morning, US President Donald Trump shocked many observers by dismissing the Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado as ""not respected"" inside Venezuela, while describing Rodríguez as ""gracious.""
""I was very surprised to hear the disqualification of María Corina Machado by President Trump,"" Kevin Whitaker, former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Caracas, says.
""Her movement was massively elected... and so disqualifying Machado, in effect, disqualified that whole movement.""
The speed, and apparent ease, with which Maduro was removed and Rodríguez installed led some observers to speculate that the former vice-president might have been in on the plan.
""I think it's very telling that we just went after Maduro and the vice president survived,"" says former CIA officer Lindsay Moran.
""It's obvious that there were high-placed sources. My immediate speculation was that those high placed sources were in the office of the VP, if not the VP herself.""
But Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group (ICG) who lives in Caracas, says the conspiracy theory doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, given that enormous power still rests with Venezuela's defence minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, both loyal Maduro allies.
""Why would she sell out Maduro, leaving her defenceless, internally, against the guys who really control the guns,"" Gunson says.
Instead, the decision to back Rodríguez followed warnings that installing Machado could result in dangerous levels of instability.
In October, an ICG report warned that ""Washington should beware of regime change"".
""The risks of violence in any post-Maduro scenario should not be downplayed,"" the report urged, saying elements of the security forces could launch a guerilla war against the new authorities.

""We were warning people in the administration, this is not going to work,"" Gunson says. ""There will be violent chaos, it will be your fault and you'll own it.""
On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a classified US intelligence assessment reaching the same conclusions and determining that members of the Maduro regime, including Rodríguez, were in a better position to lead a temporary government.
The White House hasn't commented publicly on the report, but made it clear that it plans to work with Rodríguez for the foreseeable future.
""It belies a bit of hard-nosed realism on the part of the Trump administration,"" says Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas programme at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.
But the challenges, he says, have only just begun.
""The capture of Maduro was the easy part. The broader rebuilding of Venezuela, the oil, drugs and democracy goals... are going to take much more time to come to fruition.""
For now, though, Rodríguez seems to be someone the Trump administration feels it can deal with.
""She's been a bit of an economic reformer,"" Gunson says. ""She's aware of the need for an economic opening and she's not averse to the idea of bringing back foreign capital.""
Ziemer agrees that Rodríguez may not find it difficult to do Washington's bidding when it comes to rolling out the welcome mat for US oil companies, offering greater co-operation on counter-narcotics and even scaling down Venezuela's relations with Cuba, China and Russia, especially if it means the gradual lifting of US sanctions.
""I think she can deliver on that,"" he says.
""But if the US is asking for genuine progress towards a democratic transition, that becomes much harder.""
At the moment, this does not appear to be high on Washington's list of priorities.
In remarks to the media on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of a three-stage plan for Venezuela, starting with stabilisation of the country and the marketing of 30-50 million barrels of oil under US supervision.
The plan would lead to what Rubio called ""a process of reconciliation"", including amnesties for opposition forces, the release of political prisoners and the rebuilding of civil society.
""The third phase, of course, will be one of transition,"" he said, without elaborating.
Article 233 of Venezuela's constitution calls for fresh elections within 30 days of a president becoming ""permanently unavailable to serve"" - something that would seem to apply to a situation in which Maduro languishes in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial.
But in an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump said elections were not on the horizon. ""We have to fix the country first,"" he said. ""You can't have an election.""
Gunson says Washington's decision not to go for regime change in the short term might make sense, but the absence of a medium- or long-term prospect is disappointing.
""Trump may be getting something out of this, but Venezuelans aren't,"" he says. ""Ordinary Venezuelans are getting screwed as usual.""
With the Trump administration talking up the prospects of international oil companies re-investing in Venezuela's corrupt and moribund petroleum infrastructure, Gunson says the reality may be more complicated.
""Nobody's going to come in here with the tens of billions of dollars that are required... to start the recovery process if the government is illegitimate and there's no rule of law,"" he says.
When the former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez designated Maduro as his successor shortly before his death in 2013, the move was described as Chavez's ""dedazo"", a Spanish slang term meaning a ""finger pointing"", a personal anointment which bypasses the normal democratic process.
Ambassador Shapiro sees a parallel with the rise to power of Delcy Rodríguez.
""This is Trump's dedazo,"" he says.

'Fear in the streets': Venezuelans uncertain about what might happen next,2026-01-07T13:26:35.873Z," Alice Cuddy
reporting from Cúcuta
on the Colombia-Venezuela border
","In the days since the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelans have been coming to terms with an uncertain future as a new reality begins to set in.
Marcelo, a student based in Caracas, is among those welcoming Maduro's seizure, although he is careful not to celebrate publicly.
""There are still allies of Maduro that are in power, so there are a few reasons why we don't celebrate outside of our houses,"" he told the BBC World Service. ""But I can assure you that the majority of the people of Venezuela are very happy for what happened.""
He is not the only one exercising caution. The BBC has been asking people how they feel about recent events, and what might happen next. Many of those opposed to Maduro's government asked to remain anonymous, fearing for their safety.
But there are also those who support him. Rosa Contreras says she felt ""humiliated"" by the United States.
""It seems so easy how they took our president away,"" the 57-year-old said.
Dozens of people are reported to have been killed in the operation that led to the Venezuelan leader and his wife being seized from his compound in Caracas, before being taken to the US where they face drug trafficking and weapons charges.
The Cuban government says 32 members of its security forces were among those killed.
Shortly after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken by US troops, President Donald Trump said his administration would ""run"" Venezuela.
But exactly what that would look like remains unclear. Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, has taken power in the interim. Far from a Maduro opponent, Rodríguez was his closest lieutenant.
Since she was named interim president, police have been patrolling the streets and journalists have been detained.
Speaking to the BBC at a rally calling for the jailed leader's release, Rosa Contreras said the image of Maduro waving after arriving in the US had inspired her to take to the streets to show her continuing support for Maduro.
""He had an attitude that sent us a message: if I'm standing here, you have to stand here, stand tall and keep going,"" she said.
Marcelo is also pleased that Maduro survived the US assault unscathed - but for different reasons.
""We want him to live every single day remaining in his life behind prison bars,"" he said.
Millions of people have left Venezuela in recent years due to political and economic crisis which has worsened under Maduro. But Marcelo said he had friends outside the country who would return if Maduro's fall led to a change in government and an end to Chavismo - the socialist political movement named after Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chávez.
""If the United States runs the country so there's a stable transition in Venezuela economically and socially, I think everyone would be OK with that, even if it's not a perfect solution,"" he added.
One opposition activist in his 60s from the north-western city of Maracaibo told the BBC that he lamented the loss of life in the US operation, but was happy Maduro had been seized and taken into custody.
""The man they took away has done a lot of harm. We're glad they have him over there,"" he said.
Under Chavismo, a lack of food and medicine had led to much suffering and death, he added.
""They gave the people the scraps while keeping the feast for themselves,"" a 33-year-old masseuse told the BBC, referring to Maduro's government.
She does not support Acting-President Delcy Rodríguez, but says ""if this is the price we have to pay for a government transition then I accept it"".
There is also concern over what might happen next - a common fear for those who spoke to the BBC. US President Donald Trump has not ruled out a second wave of strikes.
Gelén Correa, 50, who works in government social programmes, was defiant about the prospect of further military action, however.
""The [Venezuelan] people deserve respect. I am prepared to fight back,"" she insisted.
Should there be a second ground attack, Correa said the US would find Venezuelans ""armed to the teeth"".
Some Venezuelans doubted that Maduro's seizure would make much difference.
""They took the leader out but the regime is the same, so in that sense nothing has really changed,"" said 60-year-old José.
One man from Caracas complained that a kilogram of cornflour - used to make a popular food in Venezuela - had roughly tripled in price, while another man from Maracaibo said the price of bread had increased by about 30%.
A woman from Guyana City in the east of the country said that in the last two days, she saw few people in the streets, and there were no cars.
""You can see some military in the streets, some of them guarding supermarkets, because owners are scared of theft or robbery,"" she said, adding that ""she, her family and friends are all scared to go out"".
Another woman – a 34-year-old entrepreneur – told the BBC that she feared that there would be reprisals as there had been after the election in July 2024.
The electoral council - dominated by goverment loyalists - declared Maduro the winner of the poll, a result which the European Union, the United States and a number of Latin American nations refused to recognise, pointing to voting tallies collected by the opposition which suggested that their candidate had won.
This unease is not unfounded. Many protests in recent years had been met with repression by government forces and paramilitary groups loyal to the Maduro government.
""There are military people on every corner and groups of armed civilians supporting the government who are causing fear among the population,"" she said, adding that people were uncertain as to whether there would now be peace.
Her words were echoed by the masseuse, who also warned that the current situation was perilous, telling the BBC: ""There's so much fear in the streets and in our homes.""

Trump says Venezuela will be 'turning over' up to 50 million barrels of oil to US,2026-01-07T10:10:24.093Z," Kayla EpsteinandOsmond Chia
","Donald Trump has said Venezuela ""will be turning over"" up to 50 million barrels of oil to the US, after a military operation to remove President Nicolás Maduro from power.
The oil - worth about $2.8bn (£2.1bn) - will be sold at its market price, the US president wrote on social media, adding he would control the money raised and use it to benefit the people of Venezuela and the US.
His comments come after he said the US oil industry would be ""up and running"" in Venezuela within 18 months and that he expected huge investments to pour into the country.
Analysts previously told the BBC it could take tens of billions of dollars - and potentially a decade - to restore Venezuela's former output.
China, which has been the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil in recent years, has condemned Trump's announcement as well as the US's reported demands that Venezuela gives its oil exclusively to them.
ABC News has reported, citing unnamed sources, that Trump had told Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodríguez to agree to an exclusive partnership with the US on oil production and sever economic ties with China, Russia, Iran and Cuba.
Trump posted on Truth Social on Tuesday: ""I am pleased to announce that the Interim Authorities in Venezuela will be turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil, to the United States of America.
""This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!""
His comment came a day after Rodríguez, formerly Venezuela's vice-president, was sworn in as its interim president. Maduro has been brought to the US to face drug-trafficking and weapons charges.
The US president told NBC News on Monday: ""Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down.""
Representatives from major US petroleum companies planned to meet the Trump administration this week, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported.
Analysts who previously spoke to the BBC were sceptical that Trump's plans would have a major impact on the global supply - and therefore price - of oil.
They suggested that firms would look for reassurance that a stable government was in place - and, even when they did invest, their projects would not deliver for years.
Trump has argued in recent days that US oil companies can fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure.
The country has an estimated 303 billion barrels - the world's largest proven reserve - but its oil production has been in decline since the early 2000s.
The Trump administration sees significant potential for its own energy prospects in Venezuela's reserves.
Increasing the country's production of oil would be expensive for US firms.
Venezuelan oil is also heavy and more difficult to refine. There is only one US firm, Chevron, currently operating in the country.
Asked for comment about Trump's plans for US oil production in Venezuela, Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said the company ""remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets"".
""We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,"" he added.
ConocoPhillips, a major US oil company that no longer has a presence in Venezuela, ""is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability"", said spokesman Dennis Nuss.
""It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.""
A third company, Exxon, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Wednesday that the US's ""blatant military action against Venezuela, and its demand that Venezuela prioritise the US in disposing of its oil resources, is a typical act of bullying, a serious violation of international law, a severe infringement upon Venezuela's sovereignty, and a grave damage to the rights of the Venezuelan people"".
She added: ""I want to emphasise that the legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected... Co-operation between China and Venezuela is the co-operation between two sovereign states, which is under protection of international law and the domestic laws of the two countries.""
While justifying the seizure of Maduro from Caracas, Trump also claimed that Venezuela ""unilaterally seized and stole American oil"".
Vice-President JD Vance echoed those claims on X after Maduro was taken, writing that ""Venezuela expropriated American oil property and until recently used that stolen property to get rich and fund their narcoterrorist activities"".
The reality is more complex.
US oil companies have a long history in Venezuela, extracting oil under licence agreements.
Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976, and in 2007, President Hugo Chavez exerted more state control over the remaining foreign-owned assets of US oil firms operating in the country.
In 2019, a World Bank tribunal ordered Venezuela to pay $8.7bn in compensation to ConocoPhillips for the move.
That sum has not been paid by Venezuela, so at least one US oil company has outstanding compensation which is owed to it.
But BBC Verify's Ben Chu said the claim Venezuela has ""stolen"" US oil is too simplistic, as experts said the oil itself was never actually owned by anyone except Venezuela.
The ownership of natural resources by sovereign nations is considered a key tenet of international law.

Opposition leader Machado says her coalition should lead Venezuela,2026-01-07T10:07:52.975Z," Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu
","Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has said her coalition should ""absolutely"" be in charge of the country, following the US ousting of President Nicolás Maduro last week.
""We are ready and willing to serve our people as we have been mandated,"" Machado said in an interview with the BBC's US news partner CBS.
She thanked US President Donald Trump for his ""leadership and courage"" after US forces stormed Caracas and arrested Maduro, but said nobody trusted the deposed president's ally, who has been appointed as interim leader.
Machado and her opposition movement claimed victory in 2024's widely disputed elections, but Trump has refused to back her, saying she lacks popular support.
The former legislator, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, described US military action in Venezuela over the weekend as ""a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela"".
She said she had not spoken to Trump this year, but expressed gratitude to him for deposing Maduro.
""President Trump's leadership and courage has brought Nicolás Maduro to face justice and this is huge,"" she told CBS.
Despite her overtures, the US president has publicly dismissed Machado as a credible successor to Maduro.
""I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader,"" Trump told a news conference on the day of the US operation, referring to Machado.
""She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country. She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect.""
Machado, who has been in hiding for months after being barred from running in the 2024 presidential elections in Venezuela, previously called for the opposition's substitute candidate Edmundo González to assume power after Maduro's arrest.
Machado rallied support for González in the election, and vote tallies released by her party suggest he won by a landslide.
However, Maduro was declared president by Venezuela's electoral council (CNE), a body dominated by government loyalists. The US and dozens of other countries recognised González as the president-elect.
David Smolansky, a spokesman for the Venezuelan opposition, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that there was no future for a well-functioning country without González and Machado in power.
""They could guarantee a democratic transition, and they have the respect of Venezuelans and several governments across the world,"" he said.
Asked why he thought Trump had so far chosen to back Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez - formerly Maduro's vice-president - rather than the opposition, Smolansky said: ""Every transition, when it begins, is not perfect - it's messy.""
He also responded to suggestions that the opposition's lack of support within the military was one of the reasons Trump had chosen to back Rodríguez, saying there were members of the armed forces - both currently serving and in exile - that were ready to work with them.
Machado has said nobody trusted Rodríguez, telling CBS that the interim leader was ""one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people"" in the South American country.
""Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,"" Machado said.
While Rodríguez, 56, has faced US sanctions for her ministerial roles in the Maduro administration, she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.
Rodríguez was sworn in on Monday, two days after a US special forces breached Venezuelan security to arrest Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores.
Earlier on Tuesday, Rodríguez rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela.
""The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does,"" she said in a televised speech. ""There is no external agent governing Venezuela.""

","At least 14 members of the press were detained in Venezuela on Monday as they were covering the aftermath of the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro by US forces.
The union representing media workers in Venezuela said all but one of those detained were employed by foreign news organisations and were released later on Monday, with one reporter deported.
Foreign news media have long faced restrictions in Venezuela, with very few being granted visas to work in the country.
Their detention came as Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as the interim president and shortly after she said that she was willing to co-operate with the Trump administration, which has said it would ""run"" Venezuela.

The union said the media workers were detained by Venezuelan security forces at the National Assembly and its environs, and in the neighbourhood of Altamira - all in the capital, Caracas.
At least two of them were seized by agents working for Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency, while others were detained by Venezuela's intelligence service.
They said they had their equipment searched, their phones checked and their social media posts and messages read, the union statement added.
A Colombian and a Spanish reporter were also detained at Venezuela's border with Colombia near Cúcuta.
The two reporters were held for hours incommunicado before being released back into Colombia, the statement said.
The union called the incidents ""alarming"" and called for the release of 23 media workers who remain in detention in the country.
The repression has not been confined to media workers.
One community leader in the neighbourhood of Petare, in Caracas, told BBC Mundo that there were ""hooded men with guns patrolling, checking people's WhatsApp statuses"".
Caracas resident José, 60, said that people were not able to talk freely about what was happening, with a heavy police and military presence on the streets, as well as pro-Maduro armed groups, known as ""colectivos"", wearing masks.
A 33-year-old masseuse, who did not want to be named, said there was ""so much fear in the streets and in our homes"".
Members of the government appeared keen to show that the security forces were visible in communities, with the Interior Minister, Diosdado Cabello, posting a photo of himself on Monday night posing with armed police.
Their presence has struck fear in people critical of the government.
One woman described how there are ""military people on every corner and groups of armed civilians supporting the government who are causing fear among the population"".
Another person who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC that ""the regime is not allowing news to come out of here."" They added that ""there are uniformed personnel on the streets stopping people and checking their phones"".
The journalist detentions come at a volatile time in Venezuela, where just days ago the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife were seized by US forces in a pre-dawn raid in which dozens of his bodyguards and security detail were killed.
While the seizure prompted celebrations among Venezuelans who oppose Maduro and who have left the country, there were no public displays of joy in Venezuela.
Opposition Venezuelans have long denounced the repression they face if they speak out against the Maduro government.
More than 2,000 people were arrested during protests in the wake of the 2024 presidential election.
The government-dominated electoral council declared Maduro the winner of that election but voting tallies collected by the opposition and verified by independent media suggest that it was won by the opposition candidate.
In the crackdown which followed the election, members of the security forces checked people's phone for messages critical of Maduro, prompting many Venezuelans to erase their social media accounts and message history.
Many of those arrested at the time were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences after being sentenced for ""treason"".
According to pressure group Foro Penal, there are more than 800 political prisoners being held in Venezuela as of 5 January.

Cooper reminds US of international legal obligations in Venezuela,2026-01-05T22:11:28.599Z," Jennifer McKiernan
Political reporter
","Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said she has reminded her US counterpart Marco Rubio of his obligations under international law following US military action in Venezuela.
US President Donald Trump launched an operation resulting in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro this weekend, leading to accusations the US had flouted international law.
In a statement to MPs, Cooper went further than Sir Keir Starmer, who has so far avoided condemning Trump's decision and focused instead on the brutality of Maduro's dictatorship.
In a stormy debate in the Commons, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she was disappointed not to hear from the prime minister on the issue.
The government has been facing growing calls to speak out against Trump's action, with Emily Thornberry, the Labour chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs committee, saying the UK should ""be clearer that this has been a breach of international law"".
Security experts have warned the US action is destabilising to global politics and could embolden leaders in other countries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, to ignore international agreements.
Wearing leg shackles, Maduro appeared in a New York City courtroom alongside his wife Cilia Flores for the first time on Monday to tell the packed rows of reporters and the public that he had just been ""kidnapped"".
Making the first official government statement on the issue to Parliament, Cooper confirmed she had raised the issue of international law on a call with Trump's lead on foreign affairs.
""In my discussions with Secretary Rubio, I raised the importance of complying with international law and we will continue to urge all partners to do so,"" she said.
""It is, of course, for the US to set out the legal basis for their actions and the UN Security Council is discussing Venezuela this afternoon. These issues will continue to be matters for international discussion.""
Cooper added she had also spoken with Rubio about the role the UK could play in supporting a peaceful democratic transition that respected the will of the Venezuelan people.
Responding, Badenoch asked if the prime minister had spoken to Trump, saying: ""I ask this because the government talks up its relationship with the US, but we keep finding we're not in the room when big decisions are made"".
She said the Conservatives understood Trump's actions and accused the government of being too distant from its ""closest security partner"".
""We must work with them seriously, not snipe from the sidelines,"" she said.
""We on this side of the House understand why the US has taken this action. As the foreign secretary said, UK policy has long been to press for a peaceful transition from authoritarian rule to a democracy. That never happened.
""Instead, Venezuelans have been living under Maduro's brutal regime for many years. The US has made it clear it is acting in its national interest against drug smuggling and other criminal activity, including potential terrorism.""
The Conservative leader added she was concerned about the precedent set by Trump's actions in Venezuela, and said the ""rules-based order"" should be protected.
However, Labour backbenchers and other opposition parties including the Liberal Democrats and the SNP continued to pile on pressure for the government to explicitly condemn Trump's actions.

Dame Emily told the Commons Trump's actions had created a ""profound risk of international norms changing"" if the government did not start ""calling out"" breaches of international law.
""It is for the West surely to stand up and say, call it as it is,"" she said.
Cooper replied: ""I have raised this issue of international law with Secretary of State Rubio and made clear that we will continue to urge all countries to follow it.""
Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said the UK government's refusal to brand Donald Trump's actions a ""clear breach of international law"" looked ""ridiculous"", adding: ""Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator, but that does not give President Trump a free pass for illegal action.""
But Cooper demurred, insisting the focus should be on Venezuela's ""transition to democracy"".
Labour MP for Leeds East Richard Burgon labelled the attack on Venezuela ""disgusting"", claiming the prime minister would not be acting in the same way if the military action had been taken by Putin.
He said: ""Isn't the reality that the prime minister is willing to ditch international law and sidestep the United Nations charter in order to appease Donald Trump, and doesn't this cowardly, craven approach drag this country's reputation through the dirt?""
Cooper later told MPs: ""I really would warn members against making equivalence here around what Putin has done in Ukraine, where thousands of children have been kidnapped, where they have invaded a country led by a democratically elected president.
""We should be careful about recognising what we say and the implications of it.""
Allegations of the illegal deportation of children from Ukraine since Russia's invasion nearly four years ago led to an international arrest warrant being issued for Putin. Ukraine has said more than 19,000 children were removed to Russia. Moscow maintains the children were evacuated from danger.
Ukraine's missing children tracked down in Russia by digital sleuths
Although Cooper was at pains not to condemn Trump's actions in Venezuela, she warned that Greenland's future was a matter for Greenlanders and Danes, and no-one else, at the end of her statement.
Trump has once again raised the prospect the US could annex Greenland, claiming he needs the semi-autonomous Danish territory for reasons of national security.
Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen has described the notion of US control over the island as a ""fantasy"", and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has urged the US to ""stop the threats"" over the island.
In her statement on Venezuela, Cooper said: ""Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
""Our close European partners, our long-standing Nato allies and all our countries work closely together on security issues, and will always do so.
""The future of Greenland is a matter for the Greenlanders and Danes, and no-one else.""
Speaking in the debate, former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Jeremy Hunt warned that US attempts to take Greenland could result in the collapse of Nato (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) and accused European leaders of appearing ""weak and divided"".
""Most people's view of Maduro's capture will be 'good riddance', and I would have liked the government to be more categorical in supporting US action in removing an illegitimate and evil dictator,"" he told the Commons.
""But, if the new US approach extends to the annexation of Greenland, the sovereign territory of a Nato member, it could mean the end of the alliance with disastrous consequences.""
He asked what the Foreign Office was doing to prevent such ""a disaster"" and Cooper replied the government was ""very firm"" on the issue.

US sharply criticised by foes and friends over Maduro seizure,2026-01-05T19:37:39.014Z," James Landale
Diplomatic correspondent
","The US seizing of Venezuela's leader has faced strong criticism from both America's friends and foes at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.
Many member states agreed with the US that Nicolás Maduro had been an illegitimate and repressive leader.
But many also condemned the US military action as a breach of international law and the UN Charter, and they demanded a democratic transition that reflected the will of the Venezuelan people.
Among US allies, France was by far the most outspoken. The deputy ambassador, Jay Dharmadhikari, said Maduro's taking by the US runs ""counter to the principle of peaceful dispute resolution and runs counter to the principle of the non-use of force"".
He told the Council: ""The proliferation of violations of the Charter of the UN and the violations of international law by states vested with responsibility as permanent members of Security Council chips away at the very foundation of the international order, contravening the principles of the charter, including the principle of respect for independence and territorial integrity of states, undermines the foundation of the UN and weakens international peace and security.""
The deputy UN ambassador for Denmark, Sandra Jensen Landi, voiced her country's ""deep concern"" at the evolving situation and said: ""These developments constitute a dangerous precedent. International law and the UN Charter… must be respected.""
Both these statements – by France and Denmark - represent a significant stiffening of European criticism of the seizing of Maduro after some initial equivocation by many EU members. In contrast, both UK and Greek diplomats at the UN did not condemn the US military operation.
The ambassador for Panama, Eloy Alfaro de Alba, expressed concern about US plans to work with the existing regime, without involving the opposition or holding fresh elections.
He told the Council: ""Any attempt to establish a permanent government headed by a figure from the repressive apparatus such as Delcy Rodriguez would constitute continuity of the system and not a genuine transition.""
Colombia's ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said there is no justification for the unilateral use of force to commit an act of aggression: ""Such actions constitute a serious violation of international law and the UN Charter.""
Russia's ambassador, Vassili Nebenzia, accused the US of ""international banditry"" and ""neo-colonialism and imperialism"".
He said there was no justification for ""US domination by force"" and accused US allies of hypocrisy and double standards for failing to criticise Trump.
China's Chargé d'Affaires, Sun Lei, said Beijing was ""deeply shocked and strongly condemned"" what he called the ""unilateral, illegal and bullying acts of the US"".
In a statement read out on his behalf, Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, said he remained ""deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected"" during the US action: ""The power of the law must prevail.""
By contrast, the acting UK ambassador, James Kariuki, gave a very brief statement, saying merely the UK wanted to see a ""safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people"".
He added, without being specific, that the UK ""reaffirms its commitment to international law and the principles enshrined in the charter of the UN"". Greece's deputy ambassador, Ioannis Stamatekos, also failed to condemn Trump's seizure of Maduro, calling instead for ""dialogue and diplomacy"" to resolve the crisis.
For the US, UN ambassador Mike Waltz said the capture of Maduro was a law-enforcement operation against an illegitimate leader responsible for both drug trafficking and terrorism.
""You can't turn Venezuela into the operating hub for Iran, for Hezbollah, for gangs, for the Cuban intelligence agents and other malign actors that control that country,"" Waltz told the Council. ""You cannot continue to have the largest energy reserves in the world under the control of adversaries of the US.""
For many European countries, the seizing of Maduro has posed a difficult diplomatic dilemma.
Some have been torn between defending fundamental principles of the UN charter that countries should not breach each other's sovereignty, or making a pragmatic, real politik decision not to anger the US on whose support and security they rely, especially for Ukraine
Hence UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's refusal to say if the US attack on Venezuela was a breach of international law. He said merely that ""international law is the framework, is the anchor or the benchmark against which we judge the actions of all other governments. And it is, of course, for the US to justify the action that it has taken"".
Likewise, the EU issued its own statement, saying that ""under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be upheld"" without saying whether that applied in this case.
The EU considered Maduro illegitimate and his drug trafficking a ""significant security threat worldwide"" but the bloc said nothing about Trump's declaration that the US will now ""run"" the country.
The French and Danish criticism now places them alongside Spain, which had been the only European country to voice concerns, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez saying his government would ""not recognise an intervention that violates international law and pushes the region toward a horizon of uncertainty and belligerence"".
The difficulty for other European leaders, fearful of upsetting Trump, is that they risk accusations of hypocrisy from other countries.
For years, European powers have argued Russia's invasion of Ukraine should be opposed in part because it broke international rules about territorial integrity.
Many developing countries rejected that argument, citing western military adventurism from Vietnam to Iraq. They will now add Venezuela to that list.
The question is how Europe may respond in the longer term to America's military operation in Venezuela. Will it provide a catalyst for the continent to take greater responsibility for its own security in the face of so much instability from what many see as an unreliable ally?
Donald Tusk, the prime minister of Poland, certainly hopes so, saying on social media: ""No-one will take seriously a weak and divided Europe: neither enemy nor ally. It is already clear now.
""We must finally believe in our own strength, we must continue to arm ourselves, we must stay united like never before. One for all, and all for one. Otherwise, we are finished.""

Thirty-two Cubans killed during US attack on Venezuela,2026-01-05T14:59:21.040Z," Tabby Wilson
","The Cuban government says 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.
It described the dead as members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies were killed ""in combat actions"", declaring two days of national mourning.
The armed forces added the Cubans ""fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombardments of installations""
Cuba, a long-standing ally of Venezuela, has for years supplied Maduro with his personal security detail and has personnel throughout the Venezuelan military.
Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the country had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife ""at the request"" of Venezuela.
US spies had been monitoring Maduro's movements for months before US forces struck, according to US General Dan Caine.
Gen Caine said that they had learned where the former leader moved, lived, travelled, ate, and worked.
The New York Times reported that the CIA had also recruited a ""Venezuelan source"" who it says informed the Americans of Maduro's exact location.
Many of those killed are believed to have been part of Maduro's close security detail, who were with him at the time.
Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed, but its armed forces have said that a ""large part"" of Maduro's security team were among the casualties.
An official statement from the Cuban government read: ""Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism"".
The total death toll - according to an unnamed Venezuelan official cited by the New York Times - stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report.
In the days following the seizure of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because ""Cuba is ready to fall"".
He continued: ""I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count.""
On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a ""disaster"" run by ""incompetent, senile men"".
""If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit,"" Rubio said.
In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor, Joe Biden, easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation.
The White House said it would end ""economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people"".
It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced.
During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions.
His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it.
The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since.

Trump warns new Venezuelan leader as Maduro set to appear in court,2026-01-05T05:23:06.181Z," Grace Eliza Goodwin
","Donald Trump has warned Venezuela's new leader Delcy Rodríguez she could ""pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro"" if she ""doesn't do what's right"".
His comments to US magazine The Atlantic came as the country's deposed president Nicolás Maduro was set to appear in a New York court on Monday.
The US accuses Maduro, who is charged with drug trafficking and weapons offences, of running a ""narco-terrorist"" regime, a claim he denies.
Rodríguez - who served as Maduro's vice president - adopted a conciliatory tone at her first cabinet meeting on Sunday, offering co-operation with the US.
""We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of co-operation orientated towards shared development within the framework of international law,"" she said.
Backed by Venezuela's Supreme Court and the military, she will be sworn in as president on Monday in Caracas, at 08:00 local time (12:00 GMT).
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has insisted the US is not at war with Venezuela, after air strikes in Caracas on Saturday led to Maduro and his wife being taken into custody and transported to the US.
Some Democratic lawmakers said the operation was an ""act of war"".
In an interview with The Atlantic on Sunday, Trump said of Rodríguez: ""If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.""
He added that for Venezuela,""Regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can't get any worse"".
On Saturday, Trump had vowed the US would ""run"" the country until ""a safe and proper and judicious transition"" was possible.
Trump also promised US oil companies would move into the country to fix infrastructure ""and start making money for the country"".
Despite the US president's claims, Maduro's allies remain in charge.
The Cuban government has said 32 ""brave Cuban combatants"" died when US forces attacked and captured Maduro and his wife. Cuba - a longstanding socialist ally of Maduro - has announced two days of national mourning.
In several TV interviews on Sunday morning, Rubio defended the US's military operation in Venezuela, stressing the action did not mean the US is at war with the South American country.
""We are at war against drug trafficking organisations. That's not a war against Venezuela,"" Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday morning.
The secretary of state also told CBS that if Venezuela doesn't ""make the right decisions"", the US ""will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected"".
That includes the ""quarantine"" the US has placed on Venezuela's oil, he said.
""We're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do,"" he added.
Trump also threatened Venezuela's neighbour Colombia, in comments to reporters aboard Air Force One.
He did not rule out military action against Colombia, saying ""it sounds good to me"", and called Colombian President Gustavo Petro ""a sick man"".
""Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,"" Trump said.
Maduro, who leads the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and has been in power since 2013, has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence.
He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election.
Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured at their compound and flown to the US, as part of a dramatic special forces operation in the early hours of Saturday that also saw strikes on military bases.
The couple have since been charged with weapon and drug offences and are set to appear at a court in New York on Monday.
Maduro has denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its ""war on drugs"" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's oil.
While US officials have said that no American troops were harmed in the attacks, Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said a ""large part"" of Maduro's security team and ""soldiers and innocent civilians"" were killed in the US operation.
When asked why congressional authorisation wasn't sought before the US operation in Venezuela, Rubio told ABC it ""wasn't necessary because this wasn't an invasion"".
He described it as a ""law enforcement operation"", and said Maduro was arrested on the ground by FBI agents.
You can't notify Congress of an operation like this because ""it will leak"", he added.
Speaking to US media outlets, Rubio was asked if the US recognises Rodríguez as the legitimate president of Venezuela.
He answered that ""this is not about the legitimate president"" as the US does not recognise the regime as legitimate.
Some Democratic lawmakers have condemned the administration's actions.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said the secretive military operation, which was conducted without approval from Congress, ""was not simply a narcotics operation"".
""It was an act of war,"" Jeffries told NBC's Meet the Press.
""This was a military action involving Delta Force, involving the army, apparently involving thousands of troops, involving at least 150 military aircraft, perhaps involving dozens of ships off the coast of Venezuela and South America.""
Jim Himes, the most senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told CBS Face the Nation he had had ""zero outreach"" from the Trump administration, adding ""no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach"".
In an interview with ABC This Week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer questioned the legality of the US operation.
Schumer said that while he believes Maduro is a horrible person, ""You don't treat lawlessness with other lawlessness"".
""We have learned through the years when America tries to do regime change and nation building in this way, the American people pay the price in both blood and in dollars,"" Schumer said.
Both Schumer and Jeffries vowed to support a resolution that, if passed in both houses, would prohibit Trump from taking any further action in Venezuela without Congressional approval.
In a joint statement, the governments of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay and Spain said the US's military actions ""constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population"".

US State Department correspondent
","As the dust settles in Caracas, Venezuelans are reacting to the news of President Nicolás Maduro's capture by the US with hope, fear, and uncertainty.
People began to emerge in the streets Saturday after a night rocked by explosions in the Caracas Valley, with moods that ranged from celebration to condemnation.
Dina, a local resident, told the BBC that for now, she was grateful to the US for ""taking Maduro out of here"" because she ""at least can see some light at the end of the tunnel again"".
But the political climate remains tense, part of why she did not give the BBC her real name.
Jorge, another Venezuelan who lives near Caracas, told the BBC that while he's grateful to be ""well-supported by Trump and the entire United States"", he fears the coming days will not be easy.
""Now that they are taking this man away, what's going to happen?"" he said. ""It doesn't guarantee us anything. So there is a bit of uncertainty. We don't know what the coming days will bring.""
Supporters of Maduro's government have also been rallying in the streets of Caracas, demanding the US release their leader. Caracas Mayor Carmen Meléndez, a firm government loyalist, joined in the rally to protest against what she called Maduro's ""kidnapping"".
Early on Saturday, US forces under President Donald Trump carried out a series of targeted attacks in Venezuela's capital, ultimately taking the country's leader into US custody.
The US accuses Maduro of running a ""narco-terrorist"" regime, a claim he denies. He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election.
Maduro - who leads the United Socialist Party and has been in power since 2013 - has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence.
As Maduro and his wife are taken to New York City to face drug trafficking and weapons charges, the future of Venezuela remains unclear. Trump has said the US will run the country - and manage its oil reserves - until a permanent replacement for Maduro can be established.
Maduro has previously rejected US claims he has direct involvement in drug trafficking.
But even for those who are grateful to see Maduro gone, there's still a lot of fear and uncertainty, several Venezuelans told the BBC.
Dina isn't putting much faith in Trump.
""He says something now and tomorrow he changes his mind,"" Dina said. ""I mean, I'm not used to taking his words seriously.""
The ""only thing that was good"" about what Trump has said since Maduro's capture, Dina said, was that the US will be investing in Venezuela, which she hopes will lead to ""a better economic situation"" for the struggling country.
The danger of speaking out against Maduro is still very real within Venezuela, as the National Assembly - which is dominated by Maduro loyalists - passed a law a few weeks ago declaring anyone who expresses support for US naval blockades a ""traitor"".
Jorge said he saw motorcyclists from colectivos - pro-government paramilitary groups in Venezuela - roaming the streets with weapons on Friday.
""It makes you a bit afraid to even go out to buy bread right now,"" he said. ""We'll have to wait for the best and have patience.""
Jorge added that he was worried about the influence of Maduro's ally, Diosdado Cabello, Venezuela's Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace.
""He is a very bad person, very spiteful,"" Jorge said. ""I don't know how many people he has on his side. Hopefully, the army stands with the people and he loses some control.""
Sandra echoed Jorge and Dina's relief at Maduro's ousting. But, she too is sceptical about the future and what it means for Venezuelans in exile.
Close to eight million Venezuelans have left Venezuela since Maduro came to power - and many of them have been openly celebrating Maduro's capture in the streets of the cities where they have settled.
In addition to the millions in exile, others are ""missing, imprisoned, dead, or merely surviving"" - which is ""a true tragedy that had not been addressed by any country"", Sandra said.
""This is only the beginning. We know there is still a long road ahead,"" Sandra added. ""No country had previously heard the cry of Venezuelans in the face of this tragedy"".

Trump's toppling of Maduro is fraught with risk - what happens next is unclear,2026-01-03T20:23:07.071Z," Ione Wells
South America correspondent
","The US may want many of its foes gone from power. It doesn't usually send in the military and physically remove them.
Venezuela's abrupt awakening took two forms.
Its residents were woken abruptly to the sound of deafening booms: the sound of its capital Caracas under attack from US strikes targeting military infrastructure.
Its government has now woken up from any illusion that US military intervention or regime change was just a distant threat.
US President Donald Trump has announced Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro, has been captured and flown out of the country.
This was a man who wielded a huge amount of power: his government controlled the electoral system, the judiciary, the military, as well as having the loyalty of powerful militia groups.
By the end of Saturday, he was pictured in a grey tracksuit, his hands bound, his eyes blindfolded, being transported to detention in the US. It was an extraordinary fall from power.
The US has long accused Maduro of leading a criminal trafficking organisation, something he strongly denies. It designated as a foreign terrorist group the 'Cartel de los Soles' - a name the US uses to describe a group of elites in Venezuela who it alleges orchestrate illegal activities like drug trafficking and illegal mining.
Maduro now faces a US trial over weapons and drugs charges.
For years, Maduro's government has been accused of human rights abuses.
In 2020, United Nations investigators said its government had committed ""egregious violations"" amounting to crimes against humanity such as extrajudicial killings, torture, violence and disappearances - and that Maduro and other top officials were implicated.
Human rights organisations have recorded hundreds of political prisoners in the country, including some detained after anti-government protests.
These are reasons many in and outside the country wanted him gone, despite him still having some loyal followers. But that doesn't make Saturday's events straightforward.
The US has not carried out direct military intervention in Latin America like this since its 1989 invasion of Panama to depose the then-military ruler, Manuel Noriega.
Back then, like now, Washington framed this as part of wider crackdown on drug trafficking and criminality.
This latest operation, striking inside a sovereign capital directly, is a dramatic escalation in US engagement in the region.
The forcible removal of Maduro will be hailed a major victory by some of the more hawkish figures within the US administration, many of whom have argued that only direct intervention could force Maduro from power.
Washington has not recognised him as the country's president since the 2024 elections. The opposition published electronic voting tallies after the vote which it said proved it, not Maduro, won the election.
The result was deemed neither free nor fair by international election observers. The opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was barred from running in it.
But for Venezuela's government, this intervention confirms what it has long claimed - that Washington's ultimate goal is regime change.

What we know about Maduro's capture
Why has Donald Trump attacked Venezuela?
Venezuela has also accused the US of wanting to ""steal"" its oil reserves, the largest in the world, and other resources – an allegation it felt was vindicated after the US seized at least two oil tankers off the coast.
The strikes and capture come after months of US military escalation in the region.
The US has sent its biggest military deployment in decades to the region, comprising warplanes, thousands of troops, helicopters and the world's largest warship. It has carried out dozens of strikes on alleged small drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, killing at least 110 people.
Any doubts that remained that those operations were at least in part about regime change too have now been dashed by today's actions.
It remains deeply unclear what comes next inside Venezuela itself. Trump has claimed the US will now ""run"" Venezuela but has not clarified what he means by that.
Will the US try to push for fresh elections? Will it try to depose further senior members of the government or the military and force them to face justice in the US?
Trump said he was not afraid of putting ""boots on the ground"" and hinted bigger strikes could come if deemed necessary.
More surprisingly, he also said the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado didn't have the ""support or respect"" in Venezuela to take power. She frequently praised Trump and they were allies. Many expected him to back her in any power transition.
Instead, he insinuated he could instead work with Maduro's deputy Delcy Rodriguez saying she was essentially ""willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.""
Ms Rodriguez was part of Maduro's regime. Trump appears to be suggesting they're keen to work with her on a negotiated transition.
Could this mean leaving power in exchange for not facing the same fate as Maduro? Or assuming power but allying with the US, including for example allowing more access to its vast oil reserves? And if so, how would other Maduro allies who have long-accused the US of imperialist tendencies, and Venezuela's opposition who loathe Maduro's regime, react to that?
Ms Machado has said the opposition's 2024 election candidate Edmundo Gonzalez should ""assume"" the presidency and heralded this action as a day of ""freedom"" for Venezuela. There were celebrations among some Venezuelans in the country and overseas who feel this could mark the end of an authoritarian rule and pave the way for a much freer country.
Not everyone aligned with the opposition agrees though. Some may be fierce critics of Maduro, but also deeply sceptical of US intervention in the country – not least because of the US's record of backing coups and regime change, some of which led to dictatorships and human rights abuses themselves.
Others warn this would not also be simple given the government's grip on power in the country.
It controls the judiciary, the Supreme Court, the military – and is aligned with powerfully armed paramilitaries known as ""colectivos"".
Some fear US intervention could trigger violent fragmentation and a prolonged power struggle.
For Maduro's closest allies, Saturday's events raise urgent questions and fears about their own futures.
Many may not want to give up the fight or allow a transition unless they feel they could receive some kind of protection or reassurance from persecution themselves.
As for Trump, his administration has become increasingly muscular in the region with its financial bailout for Argentina, tariffs on Brazil to try to influence the coup trial of Trump ally and former president Jair Bolsonaro, and now the military intervention in Venezuela.
He benefits from having more allies in the region now - with the continent shifting rightwards in recent elections in Ecuador, Argentina and Chile. But while Maduro has few allies in the region, some regional powers such as Brazil and Colombia do not support US military intervention.
And some of Trump's own MAGA base in the US are also not happy at his growing interventionism after promising to put ""America First"".

Two people killed in magnitude 6.5 earthquake in Mexico,2026-01-03T07:06:35.257Z," Claire Keenan
","At least two people have died after a powerful earthquake hit southern and central Mexico on Friday.
The epicentre of the 6.5 magnitude earthquake was near the popular tourist town of Acapulco, near San Marcos in the south-western state of Guerrero, which suffered moderate damage.
A 50-year-old woman died in Guerrero, the state's governor Evelyn Salgado said, while Clara Brugada, Mexico City's mayor, confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man and said 12 others had been injured in the capital.
Mexico is situated in one of the world's most seismically active areas, sitting at the meeting point of four tectonic plates.
Late on Friday night, Brugada said power has been restored to ""98% of the failures reported"" in Mexico City.
Two structures were being evaluated for risk of collapse, she said, while 34 buildings and five homes were being inspected as a preventative measure.
Damage assessments are under way in Mexico City after roads and hospitals were impacted, according to news agency Reuters, while authorities noted various landslides on highways around the Guerrero state.
Mexico's seismological service had registered 420 aftershocks by midday local time (18:00 GMT).
President Claudia Sheinbaum was holding her first press conference of the year when the earthquake struck.
In a video capturing the moment, Sheinbaum can be heard saying ""it's shaking"" as an earthquake alert system rings in the background. She then tells the media to ""all get out calmly"".
Additional footage shows buildings shaking in Mexico City and cars trembling in Acapulco.
After hearing the Mexican Seismic Alert System early on Friday, residents and tourists rushed into the streets of Mexico City and Acapulco.
The seismic system was put into place following the deadly 1985 earthquake that claimed more than 10,000 lives.
In 2017, a 7.1 magnitude quake killed more than 200 people and toppled dozens of buildings in Mexico City.

Passenger describes 'chaos' after head-on Machu Picchu train collision,2025-12-31T16:42:33.230Z," Rozina SiniandTom Bennett
","A passenger has described ""chaos"" after two trains collided head-on near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu.
Niels Honkoop, 33, told the BBC he had switched seats part-way through the journey from the middle of the train to the back, before it crashed, injuring many of those sitting near the front.
""I saw staff running around and people crying and people on the floor and chaos erupted,"" he said. ""We got off the train and I saw people bleeding with very severe injuries.""
A train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash, which took place at around 13:20 local time (18:20 GMT) on Tuesday.
Mr Honkoop said the table in front of him broke in two. Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped ""between a bench and a table"".
He tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers, as, by coincidence, ""I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me"".
The UK Foreign Office said it was ""supporting a number of British nationals involved"" in the crash, while the US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured.
After the crash, Mr Honkoop said another train arrived with medical assistance. He and his tour group were taken to a nearby village where they were given food and medical care and taken to a hotel.
The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes.
The two trains involved were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.
""We deeply regret what has happened,"" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had ""immediately"" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident.
The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear.
It comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process.
The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative for operators due to its limited accessibility.
Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World.
Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the Inca trail with a registered tour operator.
In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about over-tourism.

Brazil's Bolsonaro undergoes third medical procedure for hiccups,2025-12-31T00:25:11.705Z," Claire Keenan
","Brazil's jailed former president, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a third medical procedure over four days to treat persistent hiccups.
Doctors performed a third operation to block his phrenic nerve. The nerve is found in the neck and vital in controlling the diaphragm – which controls breathing.
The former president's wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, shared a statement on social media confirming her husband underwent a third procedure because the hiccups ""had not stopped' since the weekend.
The far-right leader is serving a 27-year sentence after plotting a coup to overturn the 2022 election.
Bolsonaro's medical team said he would undergo further testing on Wednesday to determine where he had gastroesphageal reflux. This occurs when stomach acid flows back up into the throat and causes heartburn.
The two hiccup operations on Saturday and Monday treated Bolsonaro's right and left phrenic nerves.
Doctors said on Tuesday they did not ""believe the hospitalisation will be prolonged much longer"".
His wife, Michelle, said the ex-president's surgeries follow ""nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups"".
Bolsonaro, 70, was originally admitted to hospital in the capital, Brasília, to undergo a successful double hernia surgery on Christmas Day. He was due to leave hospital on 1 January if his recovery went well.
Brazil's Supreme Court allowed the jailed ex-president to be transferred from police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to hospital.
Prior to his hernia surgery, the former president underwent intestinal surgery in April.
Bolsonaro served as president of Brazil between 2019 and 2023. He lost the 2022 election to Brazil's current president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
A man stabbed Bolsonaro in his abdomen at a campaign rally one month before the 2018 election, requiring surgery due to extensive blood loss. The stabbing has led to ongoing health issues for the far-right figure.
He endorsed his son Flávio Bolsonaro to run against Lula in the 2026 presidential election.

Mexico train crash kills 13 and injures almost 100,2025-12-29T02:15:36.914Z," Harry Sekulich
","At least 13 people died and almost 100 were injured in a train derailment in Mexico's south-eastern Oaxaca region, the Mexican navy said.
The train, which was travelling between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, was carrying 241 passengers and nine crew members.
A total of 98 were injured, of whom 36 were being treated in hospital, the navy said.
The train derailed as it rounded a bend near the town of Nizanda, officials said. Mexico's Attorney General confirmed an investigation was under way.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said five of those injured were in a serious condition.
She said top level officials, including the secretary of the navy, were travelling to the site of the crash.
Photos from the site of the crash showed rescue workers helping passengers alight the train, which had fallen off the rail tracks and partly tilted over the side of a cliff.
The Interoceanic train, which connects the Pacific port of Salina Cruz with Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf Coast, had two locomotives and four passenger cars, the navy said. Mexico's navy operates the country's railway network.
The governor of Oaxaca, Salomón Jara Cruz, expressed ""deep regret"" over the accident in a statement and said state authorities were coordinating with federal agencies to assist those affected.
The Interoceanic rail link was inaugurated two years ago to boost the region's economy, an initiative spearheaded by former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
Designed to modernise the rail link across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Mexican government has sought to develop the area into a strategic trade corridor, expanding ports, railways and industrial infrastructure.
The train service is also part of a broader push to expand passenger and freight rail in southern Mexico and stimulate economic development in the region.

"Nine people, including five children, stabbed to death in Suriname",2025-12-28T19:32:17.586Z," Aleks Phillips
","Nine people including five children have been stabbed to death on the outskirts of Suriname's capital, Paramaribo, police have said.
Another adult and child were taken to hospital after sustaining serious injuries in the attack, city police said in a statement.
Officers were called to an address on a road leading out of the capital on Saturday night, where they detained a male suspect after shooting him in the leg. He was also taken to hospital for treatment and is under police guard.
Local media has suggested the man was suffering from mental health issues, citing officials and residents, while the South American nation's president said his family and neighbours were among the victims.
""At a time when family and friends should be holding on to and supporting each other, we are confronted with the harsh reality that there is another side to the world,"" Jennifer Geerlings-Simons said in a statement.
""I wish all the bereaved much strength, courage and comfort during this unimaginably difficult time.""
Police said further details about the circumstances of the incident would follow.
Suriname is among nations with the lowest rates of stabbing deaths, making incidents such as this one relatively rare.
However, it has endured several coups and a civil war since gaining its independence from the Netherlands in 1975.

Brazil's Bolsonaro undergoes medical treatment for hiccups,2025-12-28T16:41:45.229Z," Hafsa Khalil
","Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has received a medical procedure to treat his chronic hiccups, his medical team has said.
Saturday's treatment ""went well"", according to one of his doctors. Another, Claudio Birolini, added that the procedure - which he stressed was not a surgery - lasted for ""about an hour"".
The far-right former leader is currently serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the Latin American nation's 2022 presidential election to left-wing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
This latest procedure comes after the 70-year-old successfully underwent surgery for a double hernia earlier this week, after being granted permission to be transferred to hospital.
Ahead of the surgery, Bolsonaro also endorsed his son Flávio to run against Lula in Brazil's 2026 presidential election. His statement - a handwritten letter - was read out by the younger Bolsonaro outside the hospital.
Following the successful surgery, his medical team deemed it necessary to treat his recurrent hiccups, which he had been suffering from for months.
""It's been nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups,"" Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle, said on Saturday.
She explained in a social media post that her husband's procedure had ""blocked"" one of his phrenic nerves.
The phrenic nerves contract and expand the diaphragm, which allows the lungs to inhale and exhale. Hiccups are caused by the involuntary spasming of the diaphragm, typically as a result of an irritated phrenic nerve.
His doctors later confirmed they had treated the right phrenic nerve and had scheduled to work on the left nerve on Monday.
Once discharged from hospital, the former president will return to a cell in the federal police headquarters to continue serving his sentence.
Bolsonaro was found guilty of the coup plot in September. He was placed under house arrest pending appeals, but was taken into police custody last month after being deemed a ""concrete flight risk"".
Court officials said he had attempted to break his ankle monitor and planned to use a rally outside his house as cover for an escape attempt. Bolsonaro insisted he had no intention of fleeing.
Also on Saturday, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest of 10 officials for participating in his coup attempt. All of them had served in his government.

Brazil ex-President Jair Bolsonaro's surgery for hernia 'successful',2025-12-25T18:24:38.775Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter
","The jailed ex-president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a successful surgery for a double hernia, his wife Michelle says.
The former leader is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Brazil's Supreme Court granted permission for the 70-year-old to be transferred from the room in the federal police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to a hospital in the capital, Brasília, for the procedure.
Ahead of the surgery, Jair Bolsonaro endorsed the candidacy of his eldest son, Flávio, for the 2026 presidential race.

The former president made his decision known in handwritten letter that was read out by Flávio Bolsonaro outside the hospital were his father is being treated.
""During my life, I have fought tough battles, paying a high price with both my health and my family, to defend what I think is best for our country,"" Bolsonaro wrote.
""I hand over what is most important in the life of a father - my own son for the mission of rescuing our country, Brazil.""
Flávio Bolsonaro, a 44-year-old senator, had already announced his decision to run for president for his father's Liberal Party.
Ealier this month, he said his father had entrusted him ""with the mission of continuing our national project"". But Jair Bolsonaro's letter, which has been published by Brazilian media, is confirmation the senator has his father's backing.
The incumbent, President Lula, has already announced he plans to run again in the presidential election scheduled for October 2026.
In 2022, the presidential election went into a run-off, which saw the older Bolsonaro take on ex-President Lula.
When Lula narrowly won, Jair Bolsonaro refused to accept the result and plotted with top military leaders to prevent Lula from taking up office.
While the plot failed to enlist enough support from the military to go ahead, it did culminate in the storming of government buildings by Bolsonaro's supporters on 8 January 2023.
Bolsonaro was found guilty of coup-plotting and sentenced in September this year.
Despite the guilty verdict, the older Bolsonaro still wields considerable political influence.
Brazil's Congress passed a bill last week to significantly shorten Bolsonaro's sentence but President Lula said he would veto it.
Jair Bolsonaro is expected to be transferred back to federal police headquarters as soon as doctors give the go-ahead.

Trump-backed candidate wins in knife-edge Honduran election,2025-12-25T03:32:10.126Z," Jamie Whitehead
BBC News
","Nasry Asfura has been declared the winner of Honduras' razor-thin presidential election, after weeks of delays following technical problems and allegations of fraud.
The conservative National Party candidate - backed by US President Donald Trump - won with 40.3% of the vote, according to the National Electoral Council (CNE), edging out Salvador Nasralla of the centre-right Liberal Party, who got 39.5%.
In a post on X, Asfura said: ""Honduras: I am ready to govern. I will not let you down.""
Meanwhile, Nasralla said at a press conference: ""I will not accept a result built on omissions."" But he also urged his supporters to remain calm.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged all parties to respect the result ""so that Honduran authorities may ensure a peaceful transition of authority"".
But the president of the country's Congress, Luis Redondo, posted saying the result was ""completely illegal"".
The vote was held on 30 November but the count was delayed twice by technical outages, which electoral officials called ""inexcusable"".
The president of the CNE, Ana Paola Hall, blamed the private company tasked with tabulating the results for the delay.
She said the firm had carried out maintenance without warning or checking with the CNE.
The stoppage came a day after the portal displaying real-time results had crashed.
Results of the election were tight and, because of the tumultuous nature of the processing system, around 15% of the tally sheets had to be counted by hand for the winner to be decided.
There have been tensions in Honduras as a result of the delays with protests held across the country last week.
Thousands of supporters of the governing Libre party demonstrated in the capital Tegucigalpa over what they considered fraud in the vote.
The outgoing President, Xiomara Castro, had alleged that an ""electoral coup"" was taking place and earlier this month said the election was being marred by ""interference"" from Trump.
When he endorsed Asfura for president, Trump said there would be ""hell to pay"" if his very narrow lead was overturned in the count.
He also threatened to withdraw financial support from the US if Asfura didn't win.
In a surprise move, the US president also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, a member of Asfura's National Party, who was serving a 45-year jail sentence in the US on drug and weapons charges.
Castro was barred by the constitution from standing for a second term.
Nine days after the vote, Nasralla accused ""corrupt people"" of manipulating the vote count in the Central American nation. He also said Trump's comments had damaged his chances of winning.
In his statement following the announcement of the result, Rubio said the US would ""look forward to working with his incoming administration to advance our bilateral and regional security co-operation"", adding the two countries would ""end illegal immigration"" to the US, while strengthening economic ties.

Brazil's Supreme Court allows Bolsonaro to leave prison for surgery,2025-12-24T01:10:19.426Z," Claire Keenan
","Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has been permitted to leave prison to undergo surgery on Christmas Day following approval from Brazil's Supreme Court, court documents show.
Bolsonaro is currently serving a 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the last election in 2022.
Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday granted permission for Bolsonaro to temporarily leave prison and be transferred to a hospital on Wednesday for a hernia operation on 25 December.
Bolsonaro, 70, has faced ongoing health complications since being stabbed in the abdomen during a 2018 presidential campaign.
In April, the right-wing former president underwent intestinal surgery. By November, Justice Moraes, who also oversaw his trial, mandated that Bolsonaro be given full-time medical care.
Flávio Bolsonaro, the former president's son, posted a video to X on Wednesday with the caption: ""Keep praying for the president.""
Bolsonaro was found guilty in September for plotting a coup d'etat after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
The former leader is serving his sentence in a federal police jail in Brasilia, the capital, after being deemed a flight risk and removed from home detention.
Earlier this month, tens of thousands of people in Brazil's main cities gathered to protest against a bill trying to significantly reduce the time Bolsonaro spends in jail.
Lawmakers passed the bill last week after it was approved by the lower house. Legal experts have estimated it could reduce Bolsonaro's sentence to less than three years.
In response, Brazil's president Lula promised to veto the bill.
""With all due respect to the Congress, when it reaches my desk, I will veto it,"" Lula told journalists last week, while acknowledging his veto could be overridden by the largely conservative Congress.
US President Donald Trump, who had previously called the investigation into Bolsonaro a ""witch hunt"", welcomed the bill being passed. The US also lifted sanctions that had been placed on Justice Moraes in July.

Ecuadorean soldiers jailed for 34 years over boys' forced disappearance,2025-12-22T18:17:57.747Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter
","Eleven Ecuadorean soldiers have been sentenced to 34 years in prison each after being found guilty of the forced disappearance of four boys last year.
The discovery of the beaten and burned remains of the four boys, aged between 11 and 15, shocked the violence-wracked nation.
The court found a military patrol had picked up the boys as they returned from playing football in the city of Guayaquil, forced them to strip off their clothes, beat them and left them naked in a desolate, dangerous and abandoned location.
One of the boys called his father but, by the time he arrived, they were no longer there. Their burned bodies were found days later close to a military base near Guayaquil.
In total, 17 soldiers were on trial over the disappearance of 15-year-old Nehemías Arboleda, 11-year-old Steven Medina, and brothers Ismael, 15, and Josué Arroyo, 14.
Eleven of the soldiers were sentenced to 34 years and eight months in prison and five were given reduced sentences of two and a half years for co-operating with the prosecution.
A lieutenant-colonel who had not been on patrol with the rest of the group was declared not guilty.
The soldiers had been sent on patrol as part of the government's crackdown on criminal gangs in the country, which has seen its crime rate skyrocket as the gangs' power has expanded.
Defence officials had originally said that the four children, who became known as The Malvinas Four after the neighbourhood the were from, had been stopped by the patrol because they were suspects in a robbery.
But the judge ruled that they had been ""innocent victims of a state crime"" and ordered that their families be issued with an official apology and that the four victims be commemorated with a plaque.
He also ordered that military personnel undergo human rights training.
The judge said that evidence provided by the five soldiers who had co-operated with the prosecution had revealed the cruelty with which the 16 soldiers on patrol had acted.
He said that they had deliberately taken the four boys to a desolate area, where they subjected them to racist insults, beatings and even a simulated execution.
Defence lawyers had argued that because the boys were alive when the soldiers left, the accused were not responsible for their death.
But the judge concluded that leaving them in such a dangerous and desolate location ""was the cause of the victims' death"". It is not known who burned the bodies.

"Eight killed in latest strikes on alleged drug boats, US military says",2025-12-16T16:04:54.414Z," Tabby Wilson
","The US military says it has carried out strikes on three boats it has accused of trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean, killing eight people.
The US Southern Command posted footage of the strikes on social media and said the vessels were ""transiting along known narco-trafficking routes... and were engaged in narco-trafficking"".
More than 20 vessels in the Pacific and the Caribbean have been targeted in recent months, killing at least 90 people, as part of President Donald Trump's escalating campaign against gangs he accuses of transporting drugs in the region.
Some experts say the strikes could violate laws governing armed conflict.
The first attack by the US - on 2 September - has drawn particular scrutiny as there was not one but two strikes, with survivors of the first killed in the second.
Several legal experts have told BBC Verify that the second strike on the alleged Venezuelan drug boat by the US military was probably illegal, and would likely be considered an extrajudicial killing under international law.
Previously, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court told the BBC that the US military campaign more broadly had fallen into the category of a planned, systematic attack against civilians during peacetime.
In response, the White House said it had acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect the US from cartels ""trying to bring poison to our shores... destroying American lives"".
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected on Tuesday to brief members of both chambers of Congress alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Politico reported that the officials were set to show video of the controversial ""double-tap"" incident to all members of the armed services committees of both the House and Senate later this week. Hegseth has faced pressure to make the footage public.
In recent months, the Trump administration has accused Venezuela of funnelling narcotics into the US and has intensified its efforts to isolate President Nicolás Maduro.
He has designated two Venezuelan criminal groups - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as foreign terrorist organisations.
Thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, have been positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.
On 10 December, US forces seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast, which the US claimed was being used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an ""illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations"".
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil called the seizure ""international piracy"" and has claimed Trump wants to gain control over Venezuela's vast oil reserves.
As part of Trump's wider crackdown on the flow of drugs into America, he has now officially designated fentanyl - the drug most responsible for deadly overdoses in the US - as a weapon of mass destruction.

Brazilians protest against bill to reduce Bolsonaro's jail time,2025-12-15T17:31:46.339Z," Malu Cursino
","Tens of thousands of people gathered across Brazil's main cities on Sunday to protest against a bill that - if passed - would reduce the time former President Jair Bolsonaro will spend in jail.
The former president is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup d'etat after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
One of the lawmakers backing the bill told AFP news agency it could lead to Bolsonaro's sentence being shortened to two years and four months in prison.
Last week, chaos erupted as conservative lawmakers pushed it through the lower house of Congress. It is expected to go before the Senate later this week.

Protesters took to the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Salvador and other cities to show their rejection of the bill.
Close to 19,000 people, among them the Oscar-winning actor Fernanda Torres and 83-year-old singer Caetano Veloso, rallied at Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach to denounce the proposed changes. In São Paulo, around 13,700 took to the streets.
It is not the first time anti-Bolsonaro protests have been held in Brazil. Three months ago, tens of thousands of people rallied to denounce calls to officially pardon Bolsonaro.
In September, Brazil's Supreme Court found the former president, who governed from January 2019 to December 2022, guilty of proposing a coup to military leaders.
The judges also found that he knew of a plot to assassinate Lula.
While a military coup did not materialise, his supporters launched a violent assault on government buildings in Brasília in January 2023, after which thousands were detained.
Were the bill to pass, the sentences of those jailed for their involvement in the January 2023 attacks could also be cut.
Brazil's Chamber of Deputies - where conservatives are in the majority - overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal.
However, before it can become law, it still needs to be approved by the Senate and President Lula.
While President Lula is likely to veto the bill, such a veto could be overturned by Congress.

Fear of crime and migration fuels Chile's swing to the right,2025-12-15T13:20:54.229Z," Ione Wells
South America correspondent
Santiago
","Chile is perceived by many of its neighbours in the Latin American region as a safer, more stable haven.
But inside the country, that perception has unravelled as voters worried about security, immigration and crime chose José Antonio Kast to be their next president.
Kast is a hardline conservative who has praised General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former right-wing dictator whose US-backed coup ushered in 17 years of military rule marked by torture, disappearances and censorship.
To his critics, Kast's family history, including his German-born father's membership in the Nazi Party and his brother's time as a minister under Pinochet, is unsettling.
However, some of Kast's supporters openly defend Pinochet's rule, arguing that Chile was more peaceful then.
In a nod to Chile's past and to accusations levelled at other right-wing leaders in the region after they imposed military crackdowns on organised crime, the 59-year-old pledged in his first speech as president-elect that his promise to lead an ""emergency government"" would not mean ""authoritarianism"".
Sunday's election makes Chile the latest country in Latin America to decisively swing from the left to the right, following Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama.
Peru, Colombia and Brazil face pivotal elections next year.
Kast's victory places Chile within a growing bloc of conservative governments likely to align with US President Donald Trump, particularly on migration and security.
In some cases, like that of Argentina, inflation and economic crisis drove the shift. In others, it was a backlash against leftist governments mired in corruption or infighting.
In Chile, immigration and crime seemed to swing it.
Kast promised a border wall and mass deportations of undocumented migrants.
At rallies, he counted down the days until the inauguration and warned that those without papers should leave by then if they wanted the chance to ever return.
His message resonated in a country which has seen a rapid growth in its foreign-born population. Government figures show that by 2023 there were nearly two million non-nationals living in Chile, a 46% increase from 2018.
The government estimates about 336,000 undocumented migrants live in Chile, many from Venezuela.
The speed of that change has unsettled many Chileans.
""Chile was not prepared to receive the wave of immigration it did,"" says Jeremías Alonso, a Kast supporter who volunteered to mobilise young voters during the campaign.
He rejects critics' accusations that Kast's rhetoric amounts to xenophobia.
""What Kast is saying is that foreigners should come to Chile, let them come to work, but they should enter properly through the door, not through the window,"" he says, arguing that undocumented migrants are a strain on taxpayer-funded public services.
He says his working-class neighbourhood has experienced ""the social changes that irregular immigration brings in terms of crime, drug addiction and security"".

Kast has blamed rising crime on immigration, an allegation that resonates politically even as the number of murders has fallen since peaking in 2022, and despite some studies suggesting migrants commit fewer crimes on average.
Many voters cite organised crime, drug trafficking, thefts and carjackings as contributing towards their sense of insecurity.
Kast's victory message is that migrants will be welcome if they comply with the law, criminals will be locked up and order will return to the streets.
He, like Trump, is expected to move quickly to demonstrate an ""iron fist"" approach, deploying the military to the border and probably promoting his crackdown through social media.
But in practice, large-scale deportations will be difficult.
Venezuela does not accept deportees from Chile and deportations have so far been limited.
Kast seems to hope his rhetoric will encourage irregular migrants to leave voluntarily. But this is unlikely to compel hundreds of thousands to pack up.
For irregular migrants already in Chile, the future feels uncertain.
Gabriel Funez, a Venezuelan waiter, moved to Chile four years ago, crossing the land border irregularly to escape his country's ""very, very bad economic situation"".
He has since submitted his documents to police and immigration authorities and received a temporary ID so he can pay taxes but has so far had no response to his visa request.
His salary is currently being paid into a friend's bank account. ""I'm basically a ghost here,"" he says.
While he fears deportation, his bigger concern is a rise in xenophobia, which he says has already increased.
""Kast is expressing what many Chileans want to express. He's validating it,"" he said.
He recalls how at the restaurant where he works, he served diners who were discussing how migrants should leave.
""It was uncomfortable. I'm a foreigner, and I'm hearing all those super hurtful words.""
He explains that about 90% percent of the restaurant's staff are migrants.
With migrants increasingly key to Chilean businesses, Kast could come up against opposition from those relying on foreign labour for their business.
Carlos Alberto Cossio, a Bolivian national who has lived in Chile for 35 years, runs a business making and delivering salteñas, savoury Bolivian pastries.
He says he has often employed workers from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela and insists that ""the migrant workforce is very important"".
He explains that migrants are eager to work and less likely to change jobs as they rely on their employer for a contract visa until they are issued with a permanent visa.
""Many companies, especially in fruit harvesting, employ migrant workers who are not necessarily registered,"" he adds.
Expelling unregistered workers ""will impact Chile's export economy and make raw materials more expensive,"" he warns.
Mr Cossio acknowledges that there has been some friction since large numbers of migrants arrived from Venezuela to escape the economic and political crisis there.
""Many of the customs they have brought haven't been compatible with Chilean customs,"" he says, lamenting how this has damaged the reputation of migrants who want to work and contribute.
Mr Kast's party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning some of his proposals, from tougher sentencing to maximum-security prisons, may require compromise and negotiation.
But for many voters, the perception of control may matter just as much as delivering results as anxiety over crime, insecurity and migration is sweeping the continent.

Chile elects far-right José Antonio Kast as next president,2025-12-15T00:15:01.781Z," Ione Wells
South America correspondent
Santiago
","Chile has elected the far-right wing José Antonio Kast to be its next president, after an election campaign that was dominated by themes of security, immigration and crime.
Kast beat the governing left-wing coalition candidate Jeanette Jara decisively with more than 58% of the vote in his third attempt at running for president.
It marks the biggest shift to the right since the end of Chile's military dictatorship in 1990. Kast has openly praised Chile's former right-wing dictator, Augusto Pinochet.
In his first speech to supporters as president-elect, Kast said: ""Chile will once again be free from crime, free from anguish, free from fear.""
""Criminals, delinquents - their lives are going to change. We're going to look for them, find them, judge them and then we're going to lock them up,"" he added.
At a gathering of his backers in the capital Santiago, many draped in Chilean flags, chanting and taking selfies, there was jubilation as the results came through.
""I'm happy we can recover the country's security and patriotism,"" said Augustina Trancoso, donning a red ""Make Chile Great Again"" cap.
""We've been trying to win an election for years,"" said Belem Valdivieso. ""In Chile, you used to be able to walk the streets peacefully, lately we've experienced problems with insecurity. I'm hoping his promises will be kept and he'll focus on security.""
Throughout the campaign, Kast portrayed Chile as a country that was descending into chaos and insecurity. He pledged to restore order and crack down on irregular immigration, as well as implementing sharp spending cuts.
Kast is an admirer of Donald Trump, who is likely to become a close ally, and his policies echo those of the US president. He has pledged a border wall on Chile's porous frontier with Peru and Bolivia, maximum-security prisons, and mass deportations of irregular migrants, many of whom are from Venezuela.
Chile is one of the safest and more stable countries in South America, but a rise in immigration and organised crime in recent years has concerned many voters. Kast regularly drew links between the two.
His critics, though, say the problem is being exaggerated.
One voter in Santiago, Javiera Carrasco, liked some of Kast's policies but ended up voting for Communist Party member Jara. She said she felt ""like a false sense of insecurity is becoming widespread.""
""In other countries, there are much worse things happening than here. It just doesn't add up for me.""
Chile's murder rate is now falling, and some studies suggest those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average. But the perception of growing insecurity was the motivation for many of Kast's voters.
""We are transforming into Colombia, a lot of terrorism, thieves, robbery, society is very unsafe,"" one voter Max Struber said.
""It may sound harsh to say it, but we need the government to continue Pinochet's work. Human rights abuses existed, that's true. But as a government it was good, we used to have peace and tranquility.""
Kast's brother was a minister during Pinochet's dictatorship, and his father was a member of the Nazi party. Pinochet was an army general who led a US-backed military coup in 1973 and established a 17-year-long military dictatorship that was marked by brutal human rights abuses, forced disappearances and free-market economic policies.
Chile's current left-wing President Gabriel Boric, who could not run again, had suffered from low approval ratings. Kast's rival Jeannette Jara may have suffered by being seen as a ""continuity vote"".
A supporter at his victory party, Francisco Otero, said neither candidate represented everybody perfectly, but that a continuation of the government was seen as ""much worse"".
After the result Jara posted that ""democracy has spoken loud and clear"" and wished Kast ""success for the good of Chile.""
""We will continue working to advance a better life in our country,"" she added.
Her supporters fear Kast's election marks a return to Chile's far-right past.
""Kast's family helped the dictator Augusto Pinochet,"" Ricardo Herrera said, adding that he lived through Pinochet's dictatorship and it was ""brutal"".
Some are sceptical, though, that Kast will actually do what he's pledged.
""Kast says he wants to expel 360,000 undocumented migrants. He won't be able to do that. It's physically impossible,"" one voter Hector Lunes said.
Kast has also been firmly against abortion, even in cases of rape, and environmental protection policies.
His victory will likely be welcomed by investors as he has pledged a free-market approach to economics to shrink the state and deregulate certain industries.
This was the first presidential election in Chile where voting was mandatory and registration was automatic for those eligible.
This left some voters feeling like they had to pick whichever they say was the ""least-worst"" option.
""I don't know if I'd say the lesser of two evils, but I think Chile needs a change,"" Claudio Sanjuez said, ""and I clearly think Kast could be that alternative"".
""Both candidates were like opposite extremes,"" Cintia Urrutia said, but added she'd hoped for Jeannette Jara who she perceived as more ""centrist"".
Kast's victory in Chile follows a string of elections in Latin America that have shifted the region to the Right in recent years – including in Argentina, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and El Salvador.
He will be inaugurated on 11 March 2026. At rallies, he regularly counted down the days until this date warning undocumented immigrants that they should leave before then if they ever want the chance to return.

"Disguises, freezing waves, and a special forces veteran: Inside mission to sneak Nobel winner out of Venezuela",2025-12-12T14:27:32.269Z," Ione Wells
South America correspondent
São Paulo
","The rescue operation to get Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate María Corina Machado out of Venezuela involved disguises, two boats through choppy seas and a flight, the man who says he led it told the BBC.
Dubbed Operation Golden Dynamite, the dangerous journey was cold, wet and long - but the ""formidable"" Machado didn't complain once, said Bryan Stern, a US special forces veteran and founder of the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation.
""The seas are very rough. It's pitch black. We're using flashlights to communicate. This is very scary, lots of things can go wrong.""
Despite the risks, they didn't. Machado arrived safely in Oslo, Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize just before midnight on Wednesday.
Machado had been living in hiding in her own country since Venezuela's widely disputed elections last year, and hadn't been seen in public since January. Her grown-up children, who she hadn't seen in two years, were in Oslo to greet her.
Grey Bull specialises in rescue missions and evacuations, especially from conflict and disaster zones. A representative from Machado's team confirmed to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the organisation was behind her rescue operation.
Mr Stern said that Grey Bull had been building up a presence in the Caribbean, including inside Venezuela and the neighbouring island of Aruba, for months to get ready for potential operations in Venezuela.
""We've been building infrastructure on the ground in Venezuela designed to get Americans, allies and Brits and other people out should the war in Venezuela start,"" he told the BBC.
Speculation has been mounting over possible US military action against Venezuela, after US President Donald Trump called on President Maduro to leave office, accusing him of sending narcotics and murderers to the US.
Mr Stern said the challenge in this case was getting somebody out who is as well-known as María Corina Machado - a household name in Venezuela for the opposition.
None of the infrastructure his firm had built up in the country, he said, was ""designed for the second most popular person in the damn country with a target on her back.""
When he was first put in contact with Machado's team, they did not initially disclose her identity, but Mr Stern said he was able to guess.
When they got in touch with him in early December, through a contact who knew Machado's team, it was apparently the second attempt to get her out of Venezuela, after an initial plan ""didn't go well,"" Mr Stern said.
The operation was dubbed ""Golden Dynamite"" because ""Nobel invented dynamite"" and Machado was trying to get to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize award.
Matters moved quickly. Mr Stern said he spoke with the team on a Friday, they deployed on the Sunday, and by Tuesday, their mission was complete.
His team had explored various possibilities to get Machado out of the country, and settled on a plan that involved a tumultuous sea journey.
To protect his future work in Venezuela, Mr Stern can only reveal so much about the trip.
By land, they moved Machado from a house where she was in hiding, to a pick-up spot for a small boat, which took her off the coast to a slightly bigger boat where she met up with him.
The voyage was in ""very rough seas"" with waves of up to 10ft (3m) in ""pitch-black darkness,"" he said.
""The journey was not fun. It was cold, it was very wet, we were all soaked, the waves were very rough, and we used that to our advantage. We got her to land and to where her plane was, and she flew to Norway.""
Throughout the journey, he added that various steps were taken to mask and disguise Machado's face, as well as her digital profile because she is so well-known.
""The biometric threat is so real,"" he noted, adding steps were taken to make sure she could not be traced via her phone.
He said that Machado was ""formidable"" despite the conditions, accepting a jumper for warmth, but not asking for anything else.
""She was soaking wet and freezing cold and didn't complain once,"" he laughed, acknowledging the operation was very dangerous because water is ""unforgiving"".
""If I am driving a boat and blow an engine, I'm swimming to Venezuela.""
When asked how he could guarantee the safety of Venezuelans who helped with the operation, Mr Stern said they kept their identities secret and ""we [Grey Bull] do a lot of deception operations"".
Many of those who helped didn't even realise they were working for him, Mr Stern said, while others think they ""know the whole story"", but they really don't.
""There are people who did things that were benign from their perspective - but mission-critical from our perspective.""
He said the operation was financed by donors, and not by the US government: ""We've never had a thank-you note from the US government, let alone a dollar.""
Mr Stern said he did coordinate with some nation states, and with intelligence and diplomatic services of several countries. This included alerting the US in an ""informal"" manner.
Machado has said she intends to return to Venezuela, but Mr Stern said he advised her not to do that.
""I told her, 'don't go back. You're a Mum. We need you.' She's going to do what she's going to do... I understand why she wants to go back because she's a hero to her people.
""I wish she wouldn't go back; I have a feeling she will.""

","Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who has been in hiding for months, has told the BBC that she knows ""exactly the risks"" she's taking by travelling to Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize.
Machado appeared in Oslo in the middle of the night, waving from the balcony of a hotel. It was the first time she has been seen in public since January.
The 58-year-old made the covert journey despite a travel ban and a threat from the Venezuelan government that she would be labelled as a fugitive.
In an emotional moment, Machado waved to cheering supporters who had gathered outside the Norwegian capital's Grand Hotel, blowing them kisses and singing with them.
To their delight, she then came outside and greeted them in person, climbing over the security barricades to get closer.
""Maria!"" ""Maria!"" they shouted, holding their phones aloft to record the historic moment.
The Nobel Institute awarded Machado the prize this year for ""her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy"" in Venezuela. Earlier on Wednesday, her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa, accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her mother's behalf.
Until Wednesday night, the mother of three had not seen her children in about two years, having sent them away from Venezuela for their own safety.
In an interview with the BBC's Lucy Hockings after her balcony appearance, Machado said she had missed their graduations, and the weddings of her daughter and one of her sons.
""For over 16 months I haven't been able to hug or touch anyone,"" she said. ""Suddenly in the matter of a few hours I've been able to see the people I love the most, and touch them and cry and pray together.""
During the BBC interview, Machado had many rosary beads hanging around her neck, which she said supporters had given to her outside the hotel.
There has been much speculation about whether she will be able to return safely to Venezuela.
""Of course I'm going back,"" she told the BBC. ""I know exactly the risks I'm taking.""
""I'm going to be in the place where I'm most useful for our cause,"" she continued. ""Until a short time ago, the place I thought I had to be was Venezuela, the place I believe I have to be today, on behalf of our cause, is Oslo.""
Considered one of the country's most respected voices in Venezuela's opposition, Machado has long denounced President Nicolás Maduro's government as ""criminal"" and called on Venezuelans to unite to depose it.
She was barred from running in last year's presidential elections, in which he won a third six-year term in office. The vote was widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and many nations view his rule as illegitimate.
The Maduro government has repeatedly threatened her with arrest, accusing her of calling for a foreign invasion and labelling her a terrorist for protesting against the election results.
Last month, Venezuela's attorney general said Machado would be considered a fugitive if she travelled to Norway to collect her prize, saying she was accused of ""acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, and terrorism"".
It made her journey to Norway difficult and risky.
The details of the trip were kept so tightly under wraps, that even the Nobel Institute did not know where she was or whether she would be in Oslo in time for the prize ceremony.
The Wall Street Journal reports that to escape Venezuela, Machado wore a disguise, managed to get through 10 military checkpoints without being caught, and sailed away on a wooden skiff from a coastal fishing village.
The plan was two months in the making, it reports, citing a person close to the operation, and she was assisted by a Venezuelan network that helps people flee the country. The US was also involved, the report says, but it is unclear to what extent.
Machado did not deny these details to the BBC, but also would not elaborate on the journey.
Asked at a news conference if US authorities helped her, Machado said: ""Yes, we did get support from the United States government.""
""They [the Venezuelan government] say I'm a terrorist and have to be in jail for the rest of my life and they're looking for me,"" she said previously. ""So leaving Venezuela today, in these circumstances, is very, very dangerous.
""I just want to say today that I'm here, because many men and women risked their lives in order for me to arrive in Oslo.""
Jorgen Watne Frydnes - chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, who sat with Machado during the interview - had described her journey to Norway as ""a situation of extreme danger"".
Sitting next to her during the BBC interview, he said it was an ""emotional"" moment for him.
""In the middle of the night to have you here, it's incredible,"" he said. ""It's hard to describe what it means to the Nobel committee and to all of us.""
Machado accused Maduro's regime of being funded by criminal activities such as drugs and human trafficking, repeating calls for the international community to help Venezuela ""cut those inflows"" of criminal resources.
""We need to address this regime not as a conventional dictatorship, but as a criminal structure,"" she told the BBC.
Maduro has always vehemently denied being connected to cartels.
When asked whether she would support a US military strike on Venezuelan soil, given Washington's recent attacks on alleged drug vessels, Machado did not answer directly but instead accused Maduro of ""giving away our sovereignty to criminal organisations"".
""We didn't want a war, we didn't look for it… it was Maduro who declared war on the Venezuelan people,"" she added.
Machado says she and her team are ready to form a government in Venezuela, and that she offered to sit down with Maduro's team to work out a peaceful transition, but ""they rejected it"".
The BBC asked Nobel Committee chairman Mr Frydnes whether a possible violent takeover to unseat Nicolás Maduro would contradict her Peace Prize.
He said the burden for peace should be placed on the current Venezuelan government: ""The power lies in the Maduro regime, they have the responsibility to make sure this is a peaceful transition.""
Even after she was barred from the election last year, Machado continued to campaign for the candidate who replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González.
Maduro was declared the winner, even though polling station tallies showed that González had won by a landslide.
After her Peace Prize win was announced in October, Machado made a point to praise US President Donald Trump, who is open about his own ambitions for the Peace Prize and is locked in ongoing military tension with Venezuela.
On Wednesday, he announced the US military had seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a sharp escalation in Washington's pressure campaign against Maduro's government.
The Trump administration alleges the vessel was under sanction and was involved in an ""illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations"".
The Venezuelan government accused the US of theft and piracy.

Former Bolivian President Luis Arce arrested in corruption probe,2025-12-11T11:02:46.178Z," Thomas Mackintosh
","Bolivia's former president, Luis Arce, has been arrested in La Paz as part of an investigation into alleged graft, the government has said.
The investigation relates to when Arce, 62, was economy minister under then-president Evo Morales, who was in office from 2006 to 2019.
He is accused of authorising transfers from the public treasury to the personal accounts of political leaders.
Arce, who left office last month, is yet to comment but his former colleague María Nela Prada said he was innocent and described the arrest as a ""total abuse of power"".
The Attorney General's office requested Arce be detained over the alleged crimes of ""breach of duty and uneconomical conduct"", according to the arrest warrant issued by the interior ministry.
Attorney General Roger Mariaca told local media that Arce, who was president from 2020 until last month, had invoked his right to remain silent during police questioning.
He said Arce would remain in police custody overnight before being brought before a judge to determine whether he will remain detained pending trial.
Mariaca denied that the arrest was political persecution.
Investigations into an alleged multi-million dollar embezzlement at the Indigenous Peoples Development Fund (Fondioc) have been going on for years.
Resources intended for indigenous community development projects were allegedly diverted, projects were left unfinished or never existed.
Several officials and politicians have been implicated in the case including Lidia Patty, a former lawmaker for the MAS party, whose testimony has been used by the Attorney General's Office to request arrests.
Bolivia's Vice-President Edmand Lara said the arrest of Arce was part of an anti-corruption campaign.
""All those who have stolen from this country will return every last cent and will be held accountable before the law,"" he added.
The arrest comes less than two months after centrist candidate Rodrigo Paz won the October runoff election, ending nearly two decades of dominance by the leftist MAS party that Arce, who decided not to seek re-election, represented.
Under Bolivian law, members of the outgoing executive branch may not leave the country for 90 days after a change in government.
In his first week in office, which started last month, President Paz said he had unearthed ""a cesspool"" of graft by preceding leftist governments.
As an audit is done of public enterprises, prosecutors this week arrested six former executives of state oil company YPFB on corruption charges.

Roman Kemp: I didn't want to be seen as a 'nepo kid' in Race Across the World,2025-12-11T09:53:43.597Z," Hannah Karpel
BBC News
","Four famous duos have travelled nearly 6,000 km, hitchhiking through mountain towns, foraging in dense jungles, and battling challenges they never imagined, as contestants in Celebrity Race Across the World.
What began on the sun-soaked easternmost tip of Mexico is about to come to a close on Thursday night as the teams race toward the windswept Península de La Guajira in Colombia, the series' final checkpoint.
The budget, £950 per person - the equivalent cost of flying the route - was one limitation, but what else made the trip the challenge of a lifetime?
Sibling duo Roman Kemp and Harleymoon were candid about their relationship not being as close as they would like: busy careers had reduced their interactions to quick spare-key handovers and dog drop-offs.
They are also, by their own admission, polar opposites. Singer-songwriter Harleymoon is the free-spirited adventure-seeker who is usually the last to leave any party.
Broadcaster Roman, devoted to his work and his beloved Arsenal, is naturally cautious about stepping outside his comfort zone.
For them, the race was an opportunity to become friends again and help them discover new sides of each other.
Roman and Harleymoon describe their time with a family on Panama's San Blas Islands as truly transformative.
Roman says the race ""took me so far from where I am from"".
""It was the biggest moment for me.
""It does make you realise that there's so much more to life… You see what makes these people happy and how happy they really are, which is just this family.""
He said it also taught him what a tough duo they are: ""We've proved that we can do something together that's really hard.""
Roman says in hindsight he'd have spent more money, but being the children of Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp and singer Shirlie Holliman made him worry about how that would be perceieved.
""Harley and I are considered classic nepo kids, and I didn't want to run out and people think that we didn't know the value of money.""
For Harleymoon, the experience of having nothing besides a few bananas and a hammock ""in the middle of nowhere"" sparked deep self-reflection.
""Your life has turned into something so simple but so beautiful — it's an amazing window to reflect and think, wow, we have so much at home, and yet we always strive for more,"" she said.
""Getting to experience days like that, when you're just so full of gratitude, was really amazing.""
In the lead-up to the race, Tyler West and Molly Rainford had a flicker of apprehension.
While the couple knew each others' strengths and weaknesses inside out, life in the public eye often left them feeling like ""passing ships in the night.""
Their occasional holidays tended to have a single goal: complete relaxation.
This challenge offered something entirely different: a chance to push their relationship into new territory, and to reconnect without the usual distractions – for presenter and DJ Tyler, that meant not even his beloved Biscoff biscuits.
""It was a big question mark in our minds whether we'd even make it to the first checkpoint,"" Tyler admits.
""I remember looking at the final checkpoint on the map and thinking, 'How on earth are we going to get there?' But reaching this far really puts things into perspective - we're not as bad at travelling as we thought.""
For actor and singer Molly, one of the biggest takeaways is a new-found confidence.
""Talking to strangers, asking people for help - those are things you just don't do anymore, but the race forces you into it,"" she says.
""It's given me so much more confidence that now I'm thinking, 'What have I got to lose?'""
And as for their relationship? ""It proved to us we can get through anything together,"" she says.
For actor Dylan Llewellyn and his mother Jackie, the race was less about crossing the finish line first and more about getting out of their comfort zone.
After three decades of marriage, Jackie had never been away from her husband for more than a weekend. But she filled the freezer with steak-and-kidney pies and set off with her son, determined to embrace the unknown.
They learned lessons from past contestants: save more, spend less, and never - under any circumstances - let go of your moneybelt or passport.
""I can't believe we've got this far. I thought we wouldn't make it after leg one,"" says Jackie.
""I'm so pleased that we pushed ourselves through the lows, and I'm proud of us both for getting to the end of leg five.""
The pair leaned on each other during the toughest moments but also learned the importance of asking for help.
""I don't think we realise how much kindness there is out there. And we felt it a lot,"" says Dylan.
""We felt so much love and togetherness with families and it was really strong and beautiful to see.""
Before the race began, broadcaster and writer Anita Rani and her father, Bal, were excited at the idea of five uninterrupted weeks in each others' company. They hadn't travelled together since a family trip to India when Anita was just two years old.
As the oldest combined duo in the competition, they worried initially whether they would have the stamina to keep pace with younger teams.
But they know they have what matters most: determination.
""We're never going to quit,"" Anita insists ahead of the final.
""There's obviously been disappointment so far about the things that have been out of our control, but there's a life lesson in that, isn't there?
""When Guatemala closed down, we missed a bus, or whatever, all those things are completely out of your control, and it's very frustrating, but that's part of the journey.""
For Anita and Bal, the race has become about far more than reaching the finish line.
They have treasured the time together and the chance to get to know each other better.
""Honestly, this is life, and this is what we've been through,"" Anita says.
""I think my dad has seen a more vulnerable side of me that I don't normally show.""

BBC News Online
","The daughter of María Corina Machado, winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, has said her mother is determined to live in a free Venezuela and will ""never give up"" as she accepted her mother's award in Oslo.
Just before the ceremony, the Venezuelan opposition leader, who has been in hiding, sent a voice message saying she was ""safe"" and on her way to the Norwegian capital, but would not make it to the ceremony at the City Hall in time.
Ana Corina Sosa accepted the award on her behalf and delivered a lecture written by her mother.
The Nobel Institute awarded Machado the prize for ""her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy"" in Venezuela.
The opposition leader's daughter started off by speaking of the personal impact of not being able to see her mother for two years.
Machado went into hiding shortly after Venezuela's disputed presidential election in July 2024.
Ms Sosa told the audience: ""And as I wait [for] that moment to hug her, to kiss her, to embrace her, after two years, I think of the other daughters and sons who do not get to see their mothers.""
She then read the speech, telling the audience that Venezuelans ""will hug again, fall in love again, hear our streets fill with laughter and music"".
Ms Sosa added: ""All the simple joys the world takes for granted will be ours.
""Because in the end, our journey towards freedom has always lived inside us. We are returning to ourselves. We are returning home.""
The audience in City Hall, which included members of Norway's royal family, gave Ms Sosa a long round of applause and a standing ovation.
There had been much speculation about whether Machado would be able to defy a travel ban to attend the ceremony. In an audio recording shared by the Nobel Institute, she said: ""I will be in Oslo, I am on my way.""
However, the director of the institute, Kristian Berg Harpviken, said Machado was expected to arrive ""sometime between this evening and tomorrow morning"" - too late for the ceremony.
Earlier on Wednesday, the institute had said they were in the dark about her whereabouts, triggering concern among supporters.
As well as her daughter Ana, Machado's two other children, her mother and her three sisters are all in Oslo waiting to be reunited with her.
The last time she was seen in public was on 9 January when she spoke to her supporters at a rally protesting against the swearing-in of Nicolás Maduro to a third term as president.
The elections were widely dismissed both by the opposition in Venezuela and on the international stage as rigged, and sparked protests across the country.
Around 2,000 people were arrested in the crackdown which followed, among them many members of her opposition coalition.
Machado, who had managed to unite the bitterly divided opposition ahead of the election, went into hiding for fear of arrest.
She continued to give interviews and uploaded videos to social media urging her followers not to give up.
Her Nobel Peace Prize win galvanised supporters and triggered immediate speculation as to whether she would be able to travel to Oslo.
Total secrecy has surrounded her travel plans and it is not known how she managed to leave her place of hiding or by what means she has reached Europe.
Speaking before she left Venezuela, Machado she told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK: ""I want to assure every single Venezuelan that I will be back.""

On the streets of the capital Caracas, though, there were some who worried that it might not be easy for her to get back into Venezuela.
Maria, 66, told the BBC she feared that without Machado, her supporters would be ""left unprotected"".
""The problem for her will be returning later,"" María explained, adding that her own grandchildren were outside the country ""precisely because of the problems we have"".
When the Nobel Committee awarded her the peace prize, it highlighted her ""civilian courage"", noting that ""despite serious threats against her life"" she had remained in the country, a choice which the committee said ""inspired millions"".
Carlos, 49, said he hoped Machado would return after visiting Norway.
""I think it's better for her to be here, inside. Since everyone has left and hasn't done anything. It's best for her to be here inside Venezuela,"" he said, criticising opposition leaders who have gone into exile.
Machado's Nobel Peace Prize comes at a time of high tension between Maduro and the United States.
The US has deployed warships to international waters off Venezuela and Donald Trump has been ramping up pressure on Maduro, reportedly giving him an ultimatum to leave Venezuela.
The US has also been carrying out strikes on boats in the Caribbean, accusing the alleged traffickers who are piloting them of trying to carry drugs from Venezuela to the US. Dozens of people have been killed in the controversial months-long campaign.
After Machado was told that she had won the peace prize back in October, she spoke on the phone to Trump, who has made no secret of wanting to win the accolade himself.
Machado told the BBC that in the call she stressed ""how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy"".
Quizzed about the call by reporters, Trump said that ""I've been helping her along the way"" and described Machado as ""very nice"".
Machado also appeared to back the US strikes on boats in the Caribbean - the legality of which has been questioned by experts on international law. She told the BBC that ""when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls"".

US jets tracked circling Gulf of Venezuela as tensions mount,2025-12-10T12:34:44.891Z," Matt Murphy
BBC Verify
","Two US fighter jets were tracked circling the Gulf of Venezuela on Tuesday as tensions continue to escalate between the two countries.
The F/A-18 Super Hornets appeared on flight tracking sites near Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city, at around 13:00 (17:00 GMT), before circling the gulf for about 40 minutes.
A US defence official told the Associated Press the F/A-18 jets had conducted a ""routine training flight"" in the area.
The incident comes amid a wave of US strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea, which the White House said were trafficking drugs to the US from Venezuela. Experts have raised questions over the legality of the strikes, which have killed more than 80 people.
Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of using the strikes to destabilise the country and oust him from power.
In an interview conducted with Politico the day before the jets approached Venezuela's coastline, Trump declared that Maduro's days in power were ""numbered"", and declined to comment on whether US troops could be deployed to the country.
A separate jet, an EA-18G Growler, also appeared just before the F/A-18s on the tracking site FlightRadar24. Data shows the jet flew loops just north of Venezuela's coast.
They are the latest in a number of unusual US air force activities that have been tracked since September. B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers previously flew up to and along the Venezuelan coast.
But the F/A-18s, which are capable of engaging targets both on the ground and in the air, appear to be the first to approach the Venezuelan coastline so publicly in recent months. The F/A-18s came within 20 nautical miles of the coastline, flight tracking data showed, but the US official said the jets remained in international airspace.
Neither the F/A-18s or the Growler showed a point of origin or a destination on FlightRadar24, and all three aircraft only turned on their transponders when they arrived near the Venezuelan coastline. Justin Crump, head of the risk consultancy Sibylline, suggested the move was intended to ""support the administration's signalling and put pressure on the [Venezuelan] leadership"".
The F/A-18s - which operated under the callsigns RHINO11 and RHINO12 - flew six loops up and down the Gulf of Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Growler jet - flying under the codename GRIZZLY2 - also flew circles along the coast.
Greg Bagwell, a former RAF air marshal and president of the Air and Space Power Association, told BBC Verify that the flights appeared to be ""probing"" Venezuelan defence and trying to check for responses such as radio traffic and encrypted signals related to defence systems.
""The Growlers would have been listening for [signals intelligence], whilst the Super Hornets would have been providing air defence cover for the Growlers,"" Baswell said. He said the Growlers would also detect ""active missile sites"".
""It could be construed as the early gathering of intelligence for subsequent operations, or just a warning of such,"" he added.
Crump said the jets also had the capacity to test out ""jamming capabilities"", adding: ""This also helps send a message, when successful, potentially indicating to Venezuela's leadership that these systems cannot or should not be relied upon,"" he said.
The US has deployed troops, ships and jets to the Caribbean in recent months, which officials have said is to combat drug trafficking in the area.
On Tuesday the US Southern Command published photos of an F/A-18 operating from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which has been sent to the Caribbean.
Analysis of satellite images and ship tracking websites by BBC Verify has made it possible to identify at least nine military vessels that have been deployed to the region over recent weeks.
Satellite images also show that an airbase in Puerto Rico, which was closed in 2004 by the Pentagon, has been re-activated. Repairs have been carried out to the runway at Roosevelt Roads base and F-35s - America's most advanced fighter - have been sent to the base.

Chaos in Brazil Congress during push to cut Bolsonaro's sentence,2025-12-10T11:08:16.423Z,No Author Listed,"Brazil's parliament descended into chaos on Tuesday as conservative lawmakers continued to push a law which would reduce the prison sentence of former president Jair Bolsonaro.
One left-wing lawmaker was forcibly removed by police after trying to disrupt proceedings, while footage showed scuffles breaking out as security tried to restore order.
Bolsonaro began a 27-year jail term in November for attempting to plot a coup following his 2022 election defeat.
His conservative allies in Congress have proposed a law which would reduce sentences for coup-related offences, as well as free dozens of Bolsonaro supporters who stormed government buildings shortly after he left office.
Meanwhile, court documents showed that Bolsonaro's legal team filed an official request asking a court to grant him permission to leave prison for surgery.
The appeal repeats a plea for the ex-president to be allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest on health grounds. Bolsonaro spent time in intensive care earlier this year following intestinal surgery, and was stabbed in the abdomen in 2018 during a rally.
The fate of Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist who was narrowly beaten by leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva three years ago, continues to be a divisive issue in Brazil, where his allies have explored several avenues to exonerate him.
The latest attempt to cut the 70-year-old's sentence has been to propose a law overhauling punishments for people in elected office, including significantly reducing sentences for the offences that Bolsonaro, and those convicted alongside him, were found guilty of.
One of the lawmakers behind the effort told AFP news agency it would see Bolsonaro's sentence cut to two years and four months in prison.
During Tuesday's heated debate on the proposal, leftist politician Glauber Braga briefly occupied the Speaker's chair, which he said was a protest against a ""coup offensive"".
The chamber had been due to vote on Braga's expulsion for his role in a previous altercation in Congress, one of a handful of removals proposed as part of a wider package of disciplinary reforms, including the changes to coup-related offences.
Police forcibly removed Braga amid a skirmish in the chamber. The TV feed was cut and reporters were removed from the chamber, a move condemned as censorship by a group representing journalists.
Braga later said he would not ""accept as a done deal an amnesty for a group of coup plotters"", AFP reported.
As of late Tuesday night, the law cutting Bolsonaro's sentence - which would require ratification by the legislature's second house - had not passed.
Bolsonaro was given a lengthy prison sentence in September after Supreme Court judges found he had proposed a coup to military leaders, and said that he knew of a plot to assassinate his rival Lula.
While a military coup did not materialise, his supporters launched a violent assault on government buildings in Brasília in January 2023, after which thousands were detained.
Several senior military figures, two former defence ministers and an ex-intelligence chief were also convicted as part of the coup investigation.
Bolsonaro and his supporters have long dubbed the investigation a ""witch hunt"".
His Liberal Party remains the largest in Congress, where conservative parties outnumber groupings sympathetic to Lula.
Lawmakers loyal to Bolsonaro previously launched an attempt to secure an amnesty, though that floundered in the face of national protests, with a significant cut to sentences now proposed as a compromise.

Nobel officials unsure when Peace Prize winner will arrive for ceremony,2025-12-09T20:06:12.191Z," Ione Wells
South America correspondent
","A press conference by María Corina Machado - the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who is currently in-hiding - was cancelled on Tuesday, with the Nobel Institute saying they are ""in the dark"" about her whereabouts.
Machado is Venezuela's opposition leader and has been in hiding since the country's disputed 2024 election, which she and her supporters say was stolen.
She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for efforts to bring democracy to Venezuela, and was expected to formally collect it in a ceremony on Wednesday.
Although Machado regularly gives social media video updates, usually against a neutral white wall, her current whereabouts are unknown.
The Nobel Institute had previously said she would attend the event in person, however on Tuesday it said in a statement: ""María Corina Machado has herself stated in interviews how challenging the journey to Oslo, Norway will be. We therefore cannot at this point provide any further information about when and how she will arrive for the Nobel peace prize ceremony.""
Machado's family are already in Oslo.
Venezuela's government has said that if she left Venezuela, Machado would be considered a ""fugitive"" by the authorities.
The country's attorney general, Tarek William Saab, told AFP last month: ""By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive"". He added that she is accused of ""acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism"".
Machado had earlier told her followers that she would return to Venezuela after collecting the prize.
If she attends, it would be her first public appearance since the start of the year, when she went to a protest in Caracas on 9 January against the inauguration of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
After Venezuela's 2024 election, the opposition published tallies suggesting it won, despite Maduro claiming victory. Some nations, including the US, have recognised its candidate - Edmundo González - as the president-elect.
Machado was banned from running in the election.

Thieves snatch eight Matisse artworks from library in Brazil,2025-12-08T23:37:00.854Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter
","Two armed men have stolen eight engravings by French artist Matisse and at least another five by Brazilian painter Cândido Portinari from a library in São Paulo.
Brazilian officials say the thieves held up a security guard and an elderly couple who were visiting the library on Sunday, before making off with the artworks on foot.
On Monday, authorities said they had found the ""escape vehicle"", and several hours later one of the suspects had been arrested, authorities said.
The heist comes less than two months after the art world was rocked by a brazen break-in at the Louvre museum in Paris, where thieves made off with priceless jewels.
The engravings stolen from Biblioteca Mário de Andrade formed part of a joint exhibition with the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art.
The thieves targeted the exhibition, entitled From Book to Museum, on its final day.
They reportedly entered the library by the main entrance at 10:00 (13:00 GMT) on Sunday, and left by the same route, heading towards the nearest metro station.
Bibilioteca Mário de Andrade is the country's second largest library and officials say that its building in the centre of São Paulo has cameras with facial recognition technology.
The city itself also has an extensive security camera system. Brazilian news website G1 published a video purporting to show the two men rushing along a road, carrying between them what seems to be a sack with paintings in it.
In a statement posted online, the São Paulo government said that the first alleged thief had been arrested following ""analysis of security cameras that recorded the criminal act"".
Officials have not yet released a detailed list of the stolen works, but according to Folha de São Paulo newspaper, a collage Matisse made for the limited-edition art book Jazz is among those taken.
Matisse is widely considered to be one of the 20th Century's most influential artists and art critics say the value of the stolen works is ""incalculable"".
The thieves also took at least five engravings by Portinari, created to illustrate a special edition of the novel Menino de engheno (Plantation Boy) by Brazilian writer José Lins do Rego.
Portinari, who often painted rural workers and labourers, is one of the most significant Brazilian Modernist artists.

"Death of Venezuelan opposition figure in custody 'vile', US says",2025-12-07T22:56:47.749Z," Seher Asaf
","The US has criticised the Venezuelan government over the death of an opposition figure in custody, calling it a ""reminder of the vile nature"" of President Nicolás Maduro's regime.
Alfredo Díaz died in his prison cell at the El Helicoide prison in Caracas where he was being held for more than a year, human rights organisations and opposition groups have said.
The Venezuelan government said the 56-year-old showed signs of a heart attack and was taken to hospital, where he died on Saturday.
The US intervention is the latest in an escalating war of words between the Trump administration and Maduro, who has accused it of seeking regime change.
In recent months, the US has increased its military presence in the region and has carried out a series of deadly strikes on boats it says have been used for smuggling drugs.
US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro himself of being the head of one of the region's drug cartels - an allegation the Venezuelan president vehemently denies - and threatened military action ""by land"".
Why is Trump threatening Venezuela's Maduro?
The US State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said Díaz had been ""arbitrarily detained"" in a ""torture centre"".
Díaz was detained in 2024 after being among many opposition figures to dispute the results of that year's presidential election.
Venezuela's government-controlled election council declared Maduro the winner, despite opposition tallies showing their candidate had won by a landslide.
The elections were widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and sparked protests across the country.
Díaz, the former governor of the Nueva Esparta state, a collection of islands off Venezuela's Caribbean coastline, was accused of ""incitement to hatred"" and ""terrorism"" for questioning Maduro's claim to victory.
The Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal has raised concerns over deteriorating conditions for political prisoners in the Latin American nation.
""Another political prisoner has died in Venezuelan jails. He had been imprisoned for a year, in solitary confinement,"" Alfredo Romero, the organisation's president, wrote on X.
He said that Díaz had only been allowed one visit from his daughter during the entire length of his incarceration. He added that 17 political prisoners have died in the country since 2014.
Opposition groups have also criticised the government over the death of Diaz.
María Corina Machado, a prominent opposition leader who won this year's Nobel Peace Prize but who remains in hiding to avoid arrest, said Díaz's death was not an isolated incident.
""Sadly, it adds to an alarming and painful chain of deaths of political prisoners detained in the context of the post-election repression,"" she wrote on X.
Machado, a vocal critic of Maduro's government who was integral to galvanising the opposition against him, will likely be absent from the Nobel Prize-giving ceremony in Oslo on Wednesday. Venezuela's attorney general said last month that she would be considered a ""fugitive"" if she travelled to Norway.
The Democratic Unitary Platform, an opposition alliance, said Díaz ""died unjustly"".
Diaz's own political party, Democratic Action (AD), also paid tribute to the former governor, saying he had been unjustly detained without due process and had remained in conditions ""that should never have violated his fundamental rights"".
Tensions between the US and Venezuela have become increasingly strained over what Trump has described as efforts to stem the flow of drugs and migrants into the US.
US air strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific have killed more than 80 people.
Trump has accused Maduro of ""emptying his prisons and insane asylums"" into the US, and designated two Venezuelan drug cartels - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as terrorist organisations, the latter of which Trump alleged Maduro led.
Maduro has in turn accused the US of using its war on drugs as an excuse to depose his socialist government and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves. Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro has said the US strikes were an attempt to ""dominate"" Latin America.
The US has also stationed a large naval force - its largest deployment in the region in decades - along with thousands of troops.
The Venezuelan army reportedly swore in more than 5,600 soldiers in one go on Saturday, in response to what military leaders called US ""threats"".
The same day, the Venezuelan government said that Maduro and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had agreed to resume Turkish Airlines flights between the two nations.
The carrier was one of six major international airlines to have their landing licences revoked after temporarily suspending flights to Caracas over a US warning of ""heightened military activity"" in the area.

'I wanted to unite Jamaicans around the world with a song',2025-12-05T16:44:29.502Z," Tom Richardson
BBC Newsbeat
","Like millions of other Jamaicans around the world, Aiesha Barrett watched Hurricane Melissa tear across the island she calls home on a TV screen.
Witnessing the devastation caused by the tropical cyclone - one of the most powerful to ever hit the Atlantic Ocean - made her want to do something to help.
So she sat down and wrote a song.
The track she created, Jamaica Strong, has become an anthem for the country as it works to recover from the damaging storm.
It's also become a rallying call for those who, like Aiesha, are trying to do their bit to help family members and friends in the Caribbean.
Aiesha's heritage is deeply rooted in Jamaica's reggae scene, and she is closely related to two of its most famous legends.
Her dad, Aston Barrett, was bassist of Bob Marley and The Wailers, while her uncle, Carlton Barrett, was the band's long-time drummer.
Speaking to 1Xtra presenter Seani B as part of the station's special For Jamaica broadcast, she says writing Jamaica Strong ""wasn't difficult at all"".
""Just seeing the devastation of what was going on in my island, with my people - I have family there,"" she says.
""The lyrics just came naturally because they were real emotions.""
Aiesha uploaded the audio before the song's official release - and it blew up.
Since then, it's had more than one million views online, and been adopted as the anthem of the Jamaica Strong benefit concert to be held in New York next week.
The show, to be headlined by Jamaican superstar singers Shaggy and Sean Paul, aims to raise money towards relief efforts, but also lift the spirits of those affected by the hurricane.
Aiesha says that was what she wanted her song to do.
""It wasn't something that I expected to blow up and to be where it's at right now, I just wanted something to give them some type of hope,"" she says.
So far, she says, it's been having the desired effect.
""The messages I've been receiving is people are definitely tearing up,"" she says.
""I definitely shake their emotions.
""And they love the unity of what's happening right now on the ground.
""The song is definitely giving them some kind of assurance that, you know, things will get better still.""
Despite the massive show of togetherness, there is a huge amount of work to do as Jamaica looks to rebuild.
Hurricane Melissa left dozens of people dead, tore roofs off hospitals, destroyed homes and left big parts of Jamaica without power.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the cost of the damage is estimated at $8.8bn US.
The IMF, which is part of the United Nations, recently announced that up to $6.7bn could be made available from international sources to assist the country's recovery over the next three years.
The UK government, which previously sent a £7.5m aid package to Jamaica, recently increased this to £8m.
Ordinary people living abroad, who have been gathering up donations, are trying to get help to the country as soon as possible.
According to official data, there are about 1.1m Jamaicans living in the USA, and in the 2021 UK census 167,000 people said they were born in the country.
Estimates suggest between 300,000 to 400,000 people in the UK have Jamaican heritage.
Communities across Britain have been getting together to gather supplies, donations and support for the country.
Aiesha, who has also been collecting donations of food and other supplies, says she wants to keep the momentum going.
""A hope of faith that we will rebuild, just to know that we are strong,"" she says.
""Just to uplift their spirit, let them know that we are unshakeable.""

"US strikes on Latin American 'drug boats': What do we know, and are they legal?",2025-12-05T11:11:20.191Z," Matt Murphy & Joshua Cheetham
BBC Verify
","Questions are mounting over the legality of a wave of US strikes on alleged ""drug boats"" in the Caribbean Sea, which have killed more than 80 people since September.
President Donald Trump has said the strikes are targeting so-called ""narco-terrorists"" transporting drugs from Venezuela to the US run by the Tren de Aragua cartel.
Similar announcements have followed in recent weeks, accompanied by grainy footage of the strikes, but the US has provided no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking and few details about who or what was on board each vessel.
US officials said they are acting in self-defence but the strikes have attracted condemnation in the region. In one case, the Colombian president said a boat hit by the US was not Venezuelan, but ""Colombian with Colombian citizens inside"" - which the White House denied.
UN experts have warned that the ""systemic"" nature of the strikes ""raise serious concerns about the commission of potential international crimes"".
BBC Verify spoke to a range of experts in international and maritime law after the first strike. Several said the US may have acted illegally by attacking the vessel.
The US is not a signatory to United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but the US military's legal advisors have previously said that the US should ""act in a manner consistent with its provisions"".
Under the convention, countries agree not to interfere with vessels operating in international waters. There are limited exceptions to this which allow a state to seize a ship, such as a ""hot pursuit"" where a vessel is chased from a country's waters into the high seas.
""Force can be used to stop a boat but generally this should be non-lethal measures,"" Prof Luke Moffett of Queens University Belfast said.
Prof Moffett added that the use of aggressive tactics must be ""reasonable and necessary in self-defence where there is immediate threat of serious injury or loss of life to enforcement officials"", noting that the US moves were likely ""unlawful under the law of the sea"".
Experts have also questioned whether the killing of the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua cartel could contravene international law on the use of force.
Under Article 2(4) of the UN charter, countries can resort to force when under attack and deploying their military in self-defence. Trump has previously accused the Tren de Aragua cartel of conducting irregular warfare against the US, and the state department has designated the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.
After the first strike, Prof Michael Becker of Trinity College Dublin told BBC Verify that the American action ""stretches the meaning of the term beyond its breaking point"".
""The fact that US officials describe the individuals killed by the US strike as narco-terrorists does not transform them into lawful military targets,"" Prof Becker said. ""The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela or the Tren de Aragua criminal organisation.""
Prof Moffett added: ""Labelling everyone a terrorist does not make them a lawful target and enables states to side-step international law.""
A memo sent to the US Congress, which was leaked, reportedly said the Trump administration had determined the US was in a ""non-international armed conflict"" with drug cartels.
Responding to a fifth strike in October, Notre Dame Law School Prof Mary Ellen O'Connell told BBC Verify that ""no credible facts or legal principles have come to light to justify these attacks"".
""The only relevant law for peace is international law - that is the law of treaties, human rights and statehood,"" Prof O'Connell wrote in an emailed statement.
But US officials including Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth have defended the action, which has also been applauded by Republicans in Congress.
Asked about the same strike, a White House official told BBC Verify that Trump had authorised it after the boat left Venezuela crewed by Tren de Aragua members. The official added that the president was committed to using all means to prevent drugs reaching the US.
The Pentagon declined to share the legal advice it obtained before carrying out the strike.
In one strike, carried out on 16 October, there were two survivors - a Colombian and an Ecuadorian, who the US government says were repatriated for ""detention and prosecution"".
US officials have also faced scrutiny over a follow-up strike - or ""double-tap"" - on 2 September.
Questions have also been raised as to whether the White House complied with US law in authorising the strikes. The US constitution says that only Congress has the power to declare war.
However, Article II - which lays out the president's powers - says that ""the president shall be Commander in Chief of the Army"" and some constitutional experts have suggested that this grants the president the power to authorise strikes against military targets. Trump administration sources have previously cited this provision when defending US strikes on Iran.
But it is unclear whether that provision extends to the use of force against non-state actors such as drug cartels.
Rumen Cholakov, an expert in US constitutional law at King's College London, told BBC Verify that since 9/11, US presidents have relied on the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military Force Act (AUMF) when carrying out strikes against groups responsible for the attacks.
""Its scope has been expanded consistently in subsequent administrations,"" he added. ""It is not immediately obvious that drug cartels such as Tren de Aragua would be within the President's AUMF powers, but that might be what 'narco-terrorists' is hinting at.""
Questions also remain as to whether Trump complied with the War Powers Resolution, which demands that the president ""in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities"".
Despite some Republicans in Congress reportedly challenging the strikes, the Senate defeated a resolution in October that would have required the Trump administration to seek the approval of Congress before any further attacks.
Venezuela's government has reacted to the strikes with anger. Its president, Nicolas Maduro, denies American accusations that he is involved with drugs trafficking.
The strikes come amid reports that the US has deployed naval warships to the region in support of anti-narcotics operations against Venezuela.
Using satellite imagery, images from social media, and information from publicly available trackers on vessels, we've identified 14 US military ships in the region.
These include guided missile destroyers and amphibious assault ships.
We also located a number of military planes and drones in Puerto Rico.
Trump also acknowledged in October that he has authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela.
The president - who has long sought to oust Maduro - has authorised a US$50m reward for any information leading to his arrest. The Venezuelan leader claimed victory in last year's elections, widely viewed as rigged by international observers.

Honduras election on knife-edge as count delayed by technical glitch,2025-12-04T11:34:24.952Z," Vanessa Buschschlüter
","The two front runners in Honduras' presidential election are still neck and neck as the vote count enters its fourth day.
With just over 84% of the votes counted, conservative candidate Nasry Asfura - who has the backing of US President Donald Trump - moved ahead of centrist TV presenter Salvador Nasralla, but the difference between the two is minimal at just 0.3 percentage points.
The vote count has been delayed twice by technical outages, which electoral officials called ""inexcusable"".
The electoral council has urged Hondurans to be patient and police have increased security around the hotel where the votes are being tallied.
Election officials could not contain their anger when the count ground to a halt again for several hours on Wednesday.
The president of the National Electoral Council (CNE), Ana Paola Hall, blamed the private company tasked with tabulating the results for the delay.
She said the firm had carried out maintenance without warning or checking with the CNE.
The stoppage came a day after the portal displaying real-time results had crashed.
The technical problems have further heightened the tension which has beset this election.
The earliest preliminary reports by the CNE released on Monday had shown Nasry Asfura in the lead.
The 67-year-old National Party candidate has the endorsement of President Trump, who has threatened to cut off aid to Honduras if he is not elected.
When the CNE announced later on Monday that Salvador Nasralla, 72, had overtaken Asfura in the count and that only around 500 votes separated the two, Trump accused it of ""trying to change"" the outcome of the election.
""If they do, there will be hell to pay,"" the US president said without providing any evidence of any fraud in the Honduras election.
In the early hours of Thursday, the vote count tipped into Asfura's favour again, but the result remains far from certain.
Meanwhile, both Nasralla and Asfura say they remain confident of victory, citing their parties' own vote projections.

"As lead changes in knife-edge Honduran election, will Trump fail to get his way?",2025-12-03T02:56:42.246Z," Will Grant
Central America correspondent
Tegucigalpa
","With a little over two-thirds of the ballots in the Honduras election tallied, the lead has changed hands.
The former vice-president, Salvador Nasralla, has a small but potentially significant lead over his rival, the conservative former mayor of Tegucigalpa, Nasry Asfura. Yet Asfura's National Party continues to brief journalists that they have the numbers for an eventual win.
The race remains on a knife-edge.
In Washington, President Donald Trump has staked his hopes on nothing less than an outright Asfura victory and has tried to directly influence the race in support of his favoured candidate.
Whether it has been intimating that funds could be withheld from the impoverished Central American nation or making unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud, many in Honduras see the US president's fingerprints all over this election.
To Honduran political analyst, Josué Murillo, it smacks of the kind of treatment Honduras expected from Washington during the Cold War.
""No government should come here and treat us as a banana republic. That is a lack of respect,"" he says in a coffee shop in Tegucigalpa.
""Donald Trump saying who we should elect violates our autonomy as a nation, and it affects our elections as well.""
Irrespective of whether the National Party go on to victory, one of their key figures is already celebrating.
On Monday, ex-President Juan Orlando Hernández walked out of jail in Virginia a free man having served just one year of a 45-year sentence for drug-smuggling and weapons charges.
His release came after Trump urged Honduran voters to cast their ballots for Asfura.
Hernández was unexpectedly pardoned by Trump, despite having been found guilty last year by a court in New York of running a drug conspiracy which had brought more than 400 tonnes of cocaine into the United States.
His time in office had also been marred by allegations of serious human rights violations by the police and security forces, particularly against government critics.
So, when Hernández was arrested in 2022, then extradited to the United States and eventually jailed, most Hondurans celebrated it as a rare moment of justice in a nation riddled with institutional impunity, especially for the political elites.
Trump has claimed the opposite, telling journalists on Air Force One that ""the people of Honduras really thought (Juan Orlando Hernández) was set up and it was a terrible thing"".
Journalists in Honduras who have covered the rise and fall of Hernández – from the moment he rose to national prominence following a coup in 2009 to his extradition – struggle to recognise that description of a roundly detested former president.
However, he does still have his supporters, particularly in the National Party. And none have been more vocal in maintaining his innocence or calling for his pardon than his wife, Ana García Carías.
I sat down with the former First Lady, who described Hernández's release as ""like being in a dream, a dream made reality"".
""We spoke to him this morning (Tuesday) and he is in a safe place. We were so happy, we got all the children onto the phone together with my mother-in-law, and shared a moment of happiness, laughter and prayer together.""
In terms of the future, the question now arises as to whether Hernández will attempt to return to Honduras. Ms García Carías says that his potential return depends less on the outcome of the election and more on whether the authorities will guarantee his safety.
""It depends on the security guarantees they give him in this country,"" she says.
""Day after day, this government – which thank God is on its way out – used a discourse of hate about my husband that they spoke of persecution against him. And that's very dangerous for an ex-president – to return to a place where they've cultivated hatred against him from the very top, the president, down to the lowliest functionary.""
Ms García Carías alleged her husband had been a victim of ""lawfare"", of ""the deep state"" and of a ""politically motivated witch-hunt"" by the Biden administration. I put it to her that the case against her husband had largely been drawn up by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the US Department of Justice during Trump's first term, not President Biden's.
It was a point she quickly dismissed.
""That's what the prosecutors claimed but I think it's so illogical,"" she argues. ""In whose mind would it make sense to bring a man they say was a co-conspirator into meetings with the CIA, the DEA, to give classified information on national security?""
""There was a political campaign (against him) involving figures in the Biden administration,"" she insisted, ""and I think there was manipulation of the facts after the event.""
Ms García Carías publicly recognised the role of two key MAGA figures in securing her husband's pardon: the influential conservative political advisor Roger Stone – himself the beneficiary of a Trump pardon – and the former Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz.
""They both got involved with the case,"" she says. ""I recognise and thank them for their contribution. In fact, I spoke to Mr Stone on his radio programme on Sunday and he said that he had taken a letter from Juan Orlando, which he had written on his birthday to ask for a pardon and delivered it directly to President Trump.""
Meanwhile, the vote count in Honduras carries on into another night.
As the ballots continue to be tallied, it should soon become clear whether Trump will get his way in Honduras and see a new ally elected in the country just as he pardons an old one.

"Honduras presidential candidates locked in 'technical tie', official says",2025-12-02T05:06:31.625Z," Will Grant
Central America correspondent
TegucigalpaandVanessa Buschschlüter
","The two leading candidates to be president of Honduras were locked in a ""technical tie"" on Monday, with a razor-thin margin separating them.
As of Monday afternoon, there were just 515 votes separating right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura from his nearest challenger, Salvador Nasralla, a former TV host standing for the country's centrist party.
The head of the electoral commission called for ""patience and prudence"" while the result was tallied, but officials have not released an update since, leading to confusion and growing tensions among voters about the status of the race.
The website of the electoral council has also collapsed, adding to public fears about problems with the count.
On Monday night, US President Donald Trump, who is a vocal backer of Asfura, claimed counting had ""abruptly stopped"", and accused officials of ""trying to change the results"" of the election.
Trump said there would be ""hell to pay"", having previously threatened to cut off aid to Honduras if Asfura was not elected.
The President of the National Electoral Council (CNE) Ana Paola Hall has not released an update since around 13:00 local time, when 57% of the vote had been counted.
In that update, Hall said the process was continuing to play out but has not commented since.
The outgoing president, Xiomara Castro of the left-wing Libre party, was barred by the constitution from standing for a second term. She backed Rixi Moncada.
Officials said turnout was expected to be strong among the 6.5m registered voters, but no official figures have yet been released.
Many Hondurans had a sense that this would not be an entirely straightforward election but few would have foreseen the vote count being this close.
The collapse of the official election website, apparently due to high traffic, has only compounded fears among voters of problems with the count.
People are keen to avoid an extended period of uncertainty or legal challenges over the result, which could be the case if the numbers remain close.
Shortly before casting their ballots, voters at a farmers' market in Tegucigalpa spoke of their desire for change.
""People must vote based on reality in front of us, and not stay blindly loyal to any party colours,"" insisted walnut-seller Nicole Castillo, adding that she believed that meant acknowledging the ingrained corruption in Honduran politics.
Nolvy Oriales, who owns a cheese counter nearby, said that her main motivation for voting was also to stamp out corruption and cronyism.
""I think we need to try someone new, someone who hasn't been in power before, because these last few years have been very, very tough,"" she said.
For many, the person who represents a new start is Nasralla of the Liberal Party, who has portrayed himself as the man who will put an end to corruption in Honduras if he is elected.
Although he was the vice-president for a time alongside incumbent Xiomara Castro, the two fell out and he resigned. Most know him best from his work as a television sports presenter.
The other option in front of those who wanted a break with the governing Libre party was Asfura, the candidate favoured by Trump.
Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday that the US would be ""very supportive"" if centre-right candidate Asfura won the presidential election.
""If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,"" Trump added.
But the US president's last-minute intervention angered many as they went to the polls.
Casting his ballot at a school in Tegucigalpa, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport Octavio Pineda told the BBC that President Trump's social media posts amounted to meddling.
""It's totally electoral interference by the US president and we have publicly denounced it as such. We heard his words, but we don't share his views.""
In one social media post, Mr Trump also controversially promised to pardon the disgraced former Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, who is currently serving 45 years in a US prison for smuggling drugs and weapons.
""Remember, it wasn't even the Honduran justice system which tried and sentenced our ex-president for drug trafficking. It was the US Attorney General's office itself,"" recalls Minister Pineda.
Meanwhile, Asfura has carefully tried to distance himself from Hernández.
On Friday he told news agency AFP that he has ""no ties"" with the ex-president, and that ""the party is not responsible for his personal actions"".
For now, the vote count goes on, and the tension in Honduras continues to rise.
People have bad memories of street violence following disputed election result in 2017 when Juan Orlando Hernández claimed victory in a vote count which was questioned by international observers and the Organisation of American States (OAS).
Pitched battles between protesters and the police lead to at least 20 deaths.
No-one wants a repeat of those dark days, and people remain hopeful that calm will prevail.
Yet some shop owners have reportedly boarded up their businesses and some employees are staying away from work, at least until the drama of the vote count is over, and the name of the president-elect is clear.

Dozens missing as deadly landslide hits two boats in Peru,2025-12-01T19:13:10.223Z," Maia Davies
","At least 12 people have died and around 50 are still missing after a landslide struck two boats docked at a river port in Peru's Amazon rainforest region, local media reports.
The landslide sank a ferry and seriously damaged another passenger vessel that had dozens of people on board, according to a police report cited by the Andina news agency.
It happened at around 05:00 local time (10:00 GMT) as passengers were set to disembark at Iparia, in the country's central Ucayali region on Monday.
The injured have been taken to hospital while national police and the Peruvian Navy look for more survivors. It is feared that children are among the missing.
The landslide was caused by ""erosion"" of the bank of the Ucayali River - the headwater of the Amazon - the country's National Emergency Operations Center said on X.
Some 50 people were on board one of the boats, according to news agency AFP.
Rescue operations have been hindered by the fast-flowing river waters, a navy official told AFP.
Children, teachers and doctors were among the passengers, the Reuters news agency reports, citing Andina.
Authorities are working with families gathered at the scene of the disaster to try to determine exactly how many people still need to be found.
One of the boats had departed Pucallpa to the north on Sunday and was travelling towards the riverside communities of Caco Macaya, Curiaca del Caco, and Pueblo Nuevo del Caco, local media reports.

Venezuela condemns Trump airspace closure warning,2025-11-30T04:39:09.069Z," Aoife Walsh
Washington
","Venezuela has condemned US President Donald Trump's statement that the airspace around the country should be considered closed.
The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments ""another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people"".
The US does not have legal authority to close another country's airspace and the Venezuelan statement accused Trump of making a ""colonialist threat"".
The US has built its military presence in the area and carried out at least 21 strikes on boats it said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80, without providing evidence. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has said the US actions are attempt to oust him.
Trump wrote on Truth Social: ""To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.""
The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.
Some Democratic and Republican members of the US Congress have expressed anger that Trump has not sought legislative approval.
""Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,"" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer posted on X on Sunday.
""Under our constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.""
Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, until recently a close Trump ally, said: ""Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.""
Trump's comments come just days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of ""heightened military activity in and around Venezuela"", leading to several major airlines suspending flights there. Caracas then rescinded their take-off and landing rights.
Venezuela's foreign ministry urged ""the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organisations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression"", in a statement on Saturday.
The same day, Venezuela's military conducted exercises along coastal areas, with state TV showing anti-aircraft weapons and other artillery being manoeuvred.
The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.
It has insisted that the deployment - the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 - is to combat drug trafficking.
Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking ""by land"" would begin ""very soon"".
The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US is to depose the left-wing Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many nations as rigged.
Fellow left-wing President Gustavo Petro of Colombia - who has also faced US sanctions - has said he believed the US was using ""violence to dominate"" Latin America, though other leaders in the region have welcomed Trump's stance.
The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.
Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.
Venezuela's foreign ministry has ""categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected"" the designation.

Two former Peruvian presidents jailed in two days,2025-11-28T11:36:20.014Z," Anna Lamche
","Peru's former President Pedro Castillo is among two of the South American nation's ex-leaders to be handed prison sentences in as many days.
The left-wing leader was given 11 years in jail on Thursday for attempting to disband Peru's Congress and rule by decree in 2022. The gamble failed, and he was impeached and arrested.
He was found guilty of ""conspiracy to commit rebellion"" by the Supreme Court, which handed down the sentence at the same time as convicting him.
Castillo's sentence comes just a day after another former Peruvian president, Martín Vizcarra, was handed 14 years' in prison for bribe-taking while serving as a regional governor.
The centrist politician, who had championed the fight against corruption during his term in office, was found guilty of taking bribes while governor of the Moquegua region between 2011 and 2014.
Prosecutors said he received bribes worth more than $600,000 (£453,753) from construction companies who were seeking contracts for public works. Vizcarra has always maintained his innocence.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court acquitted Castillo of two other charges.
Dubbed Peru's first poor president, Castillo, a former trade unionist and rural schoolteacher, won power in 2021 on a wave of frustration with conventional politics.
His arrest and impeachment sparked deadly mass protests in 2022 among his working-class rural base. The protests were brutally repressed by security forces, leaving at least 50 dead.
On Thursday, dozens of Castillo's supporters gathered outside the prison he is being held in to await the verdict, according to AFP.
One supporter, Julia Buendia, told the news agency she still believed Castillo was innocent.
Vizcarra and Castillo are the latest in a series of former Peruvian presidents to be jailed for misconduct.
Ollanta Humala, who served as the nation's president between 2011 and 2016, was found guilty of money laundering and sentenced to 15 years in prison earlier this year.
Meanwhile, Alejandro Toledo, who governed it from 2001 to 2006, was sentenced last year to more than 20 years in prison for taking $35m (£26m) in bribes from a construction company.
Peru has been beset by political crises in recent years.
In October, clashes between anti-government protesters and riot police in the Peruvian capital, Lima, left one man and more than 100 injured.
The protests came after the current President José Jerí was sworn in on an interim basis following the impeachment of his predecessor, Dina Boluarte.
Boluarte was ousted by lawmakers on grounds of ""permanent moral incapacity"" amid soaring crime rates in Peru.
Her presidency was overshadowed by several investigations, including a corruption inquiry dubbed ""Rolexgate"", concerning allegations she accepted Rolex watches as bribes.

Fracking has transformed an Argentine town but what about the nation?,2025-11-27T00:02:47.835Z," Matías Zibell García
from BBC Mundo
Añelo
Argentina
","Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez found himself in the right place at the right time.
When his father moved their family-owned tyre repair shop to the rural Argentine town of Añelo, it was a small, sleepy place, some 1,000km (600 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires.
There was no mains water or gas, and the electricity supply was constantly being cut off.
Then in 2014, fracking for oil and gas started in the surrounding region, and the conurbation boomed.
""We set up the tyre repair shop in the middle of the sand dunes, far from the town centre,"" says Mr Jiménez. ""Then the town grew and passed us by.""
Fuelled by its new-found energy wealth, Añelo's population soared from 10,788 in 2010 to 17,893 in 2022, an increase of more than 60%.
In addition to these people who are already permanently settled in Añelo, there are some 15,000 industry workers who sleep in the city every night.
This has made the roads very busy, including lots of oil tankers going through.
Last year, 24,956 vehicles entered the town every day, of which 6,400 were lorries, official figures showed. Mr Jiménez's workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres.
Añelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn't until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed.
Fracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface.
The first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina's majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron.
By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas.
This accounts ""for more than half of Argentina's oil and gas production"", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official.
He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to.
Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. ""We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,"" he says. ""All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta.""
The oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency.
""Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],"" says Mr Gadano. ""This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices.""
Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports ""is very important"" for the country, ""especially when two or three years ago we were in the red"". Yet he adds that it won't be ""the panacea"" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt.
""I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,"" he says.
""However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind.""
Other commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina's bad credit rating is putting off international investors.
They also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank.
""Companies say 'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven't been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force',"" explains Mr Gadano. ""That's not how the world works, that's not how companies work, especially the big international players.""
The government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party's victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted.
Other critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection.
Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government ""is doing what it has to do and what it can do"".
What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. ""All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,"" notes Mr Gadano.
This consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns.
""We are really losing in the public debate,"" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. ""There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic.""
Back at Mr Jiménez's garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. ""When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day.""
Yet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country's problems. ""Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs.""

Bolsonaro ordered to start serving 27-year prison sentence for Brazil coup plot,2025-11-26T10:54:39.585Z," Kathryn Armstrong
","Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered that right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro begin serving his prison sentence of 27 years and three months for plotting a coup after he lost the last election.
Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday ruled that the case had reached its final judgement and that no further appeals were possible.
Bolsonaro, 70, was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
He will begin serving his sentence in a federal police jail cell in the capital, Brasilia, where he has been detained since Saturday after being deemed a flight risk and removed from home detention.
At a hearing on Sunday, Bolsonaro admitted trying to open his ankle monitor with a soldering iron until he ""came to his senses"", court documents show.
He said he had had no intention of fleeing and blamed medicine-induced ""paranoia"" for damage he caused to the monitor.
Justice Moraes on Tuesday mandated that full-time medical care be given to Bolsonaro, whose medical team has previously said he is suffering from worsening health.
Supreme Court justices said in September, when Bolsonaro was found guilty of plotting a coup, that he had known of plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes, who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.
The conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.
But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.
The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro, whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.
Bolsonaro was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.
The former president called the trial a ""witch hunt"" designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.
Justice Moraes also ordered on Tuesday that others found guilty of being Bolsonaro's co-conspirators must begin their sentences.
They include Gen Augusto Heleno, former minister for institutional security, and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, former defence minister.

","Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president convicted of plotting a coup, has blamed medicine-induced ""paranoia"" for damage he caused to his ankle monitor - a day after he was removed from house arrest into detention.
At a hearing in Brasília, he admitted trying to open the monitor with a soldering iron on Friday until he ""came to his senses"", court documents show. He said he had had no intention of fleeing.
Officials say the right-wing politician, 70, was taken into custody because he was a flight risk ahead of a supporters' vigil outside his home. He will remain in detention.
In September, Bolsonaro was sentenced to more than 27 years in prison for the coup plot.
Bolsonaro is being held in a police station in the capital.
His legal woes have drawn the ire of fellow right-wing populist US President Donald Trump, prompting him to impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods.

","Jair Bolsonaro has been taken into custody after being determined a ""concrete flight risk"" while under house arrest.
The right-wing former Brazilian president was found guilty of plotting a military coup in September and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison, but remains under house arrest pending appeals.
Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said detaining the 70-year-old was a preventative measure after ""new facts"" came to light.
In a video released by the court, a police official questioned the former president about damage to his ankle monitor.
Bolsonaro said he burned the monitor's case with a soldering iron out of ""curiosity"", but denied wanting to remove it.
Court officials said he wanted to use a planned rally outside his house as a cover to break free. His lawyer denied the claims.
In a filing authorising the arrest, Justice Moraes said information from the centre monitoring Bolsonaro's house arrest suggested the former president's ""intention to break the electronic ankle bracelet to ensure success in his escape"".
This, it said, would be ""facilitated by the confusion caused by the demonstration called by his son"".
Flávio Bolsonaro, who serves a senator, called for a gathering of his supporters near his father's home to take place on Saturday night.
The senator wrote on social media on Friday: ""Are you going to fight for your country, or watch it all from your phone there on your sofa? I invite you to fight with us.""
He said the vigil would enable supporters to ""pray for his health and for the return of democracy in our country"".
To explain his decision, Justice Moraes cited the possibility of Bolsonaro fleeing to foreign embassies, citing ""a history of planning to request asylum through a diplomatic representation"".
The court filing notes that the US embassy in the capital, Brasilia, is located about 13km (8 miles) from Bolsonaro's home.
Bolsonaro's legal woes have drawn the ire of fellow right-wing populist US President Donald Trump, prompting him to impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods.
Bolsonaro is being held in a police station in Brasilia and will undergo a custody hearing on Sunday.
On Friday, the former president's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to allow him to serve his whole jail sentence under house arrest, with electronic monitoring.
They also asked that Bolsonaro be allowed to leave his home for medical treatment, saying he required regular treatment for pulmonary infections and other ailments.
Bolsonaro's lawyer Paulo Cunha Bueno told journalists outside the Federal Police building that concerns about his ankle monitor was ""a narrative that tries to justify the unjustifiable"".
He added: ""Bolsonaro did not want, in any way, to escape from his house.
""There is a patrol with armed federal agents, 24 hours a day, seven days a week at the door of his house.""
Bolsonaro was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Supreme Court justices said that he knew of a plot which included plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes, who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.
The conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.
But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.
The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.
At the time, Bolsonaro's lawyers called the 27 years and three months sentence ""absurdly excessive"".
He was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.
The former president called the trial a ""witch hunt"" and said it was designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.

Trump says world has 10 days to see if Iran agrees deal or 'bad things happen',2026-02-20T05:45:43.851Z," Bernd Debusmann Jr
White House reporter
","US President Donald Trump says the world will find out ""over the next, probably, 10 days"" whether the US will reach a deal with Iran or take military action.
At the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington DC, Trump said of negotiations with the Islamic Republic about its nuclear programme: ""We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen.""
In recent days, the US has surged military forces to the Middle East, while progress was reported at talks between American and Iranian negotiators in Switzerland.
The Iranian government has told the UN Secretary-General that it will regard US bases in the region as legitimate targets if used in any military aggression against Iran.
Tehran's UN mission said in a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres that Trump's rhetoric signalled a real risk of an attack - but it said Iran did not want a war.
Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, have voiced opposition to any potential military action in Iran without congressional approval.
In his remarks, Trump noted that Special Envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is also Trump's son-in-law, had ""some very good meetings"" with Iran.
""It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran,"" he said. ""Otherwise bad things happen.""
One day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned that Iran would be ""very wise"" to make a deal with the US, adding that Trump was still hoping for a diplomatic solution over Tehran's nuclear programme.
When Trump first announced the Board of Peace, it was thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction.
But in the last month its mission has appeared to go beyond one conflict, with many wondering if the Trump-chaired board, made up of about two dozen countries, is meant to sideline the United Nations.
US missile and aircraft struck three Iranian nuclear facilities in June last year, and the White House was reportedly discussing new attack options this week.
American forces have been ramping up their presence in the region in recent weeks, including the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.
However, the BBC understands that the British government has not given permission for the US to use UK military bases to support any potential strikes on Iran.
In previous military operations in the Middle East, the US used RAF Fairford, in Gloucestershire, and the UK overseas territory of Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean.
Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces.
""The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,"" one of Khamenei's posts read.
""However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.""
Several members of US Congress have expressed opposition to any military action against Iran.
California Democrat Ro Khanna and Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie have said they will try to force a vote on the matter next week, citing the 1973 War Powers Act.
The act grants Congress the ability to check the president's power to commit the US to armed conflict.
""A war with Iran would be catastrophic,"" Khanna posted on social media. ""Iran is a complex society of 90 million people with significant air defences and military capabilities.""
He also said thousands of US troops in the region ""could be at risk of retaliation"".
The chances of passage in both chambers of Congress are not strong.
In January, Senate Republicans blocked a similar war powers resolution that would have required the Trump administration to obtain congressional approval before launching further military operations in Venezuela following the capture of Nicolas Maduro.

US to withdraw troops from Syria as tensions mount with Iran,2026-02-19T01:14:47.215Z," Brandon Drenon
","The US is preparing to largely withdraw its remaining troops from Syria over the next few months, a senior White House official has told the BBC.
The official said the Syrian government had agreed to take the lead combatting terrorism within its borders and US military presence ""at scale"" was no longer required.
American troops have been in Syria since 2015, as part of an anti-terrorism campaign to counter the influence of the Islamic State group (IS).
The decision came as US President Donald Trump ramps up military presence in the Middle East while tensions mount with Iran.
The official noted that the decision to remove the roughly 1,000 remaining troops from Syria is part of a conditions-based transition, and that the US remains ready to respond to any threats in the region.
The news comes amid an increased presence of US troops in the region, specifically near Iran.
BBC Verify has confirmed the location of aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln - equipped with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets - near Iran.
The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East, expected to arrive in the region within the next three weeks.
Senior national security officials told the BBC's US partner CBS News that Trump said the US military would be ready for potential strikes on Iran as soon as Saturday, though Trump has not yet made a final decision.
In Syria, US troops had already departed two bases earlier this year, the al-Tanf garrison in southern Syria and the al-Shaddadi base in the north-east.
The movements follow the collapse of the Assad government in 2024, and a weakened Islamic State amid considerable security improvement in Syria.
Since then, the Trump administration has sought to strengthen its diplomatic ties with Damascus and increase its partnership with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa.
Sharaa visited Trump in the White House in November, the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.
His government has at times clashed with local military groups, but struck a deal in January that would integrate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with Syria's armed forces.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio met his Syrian counterpart, Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani, last week to discuss maintaining the ceasefire. Rubio also expressed concerns about the continued fight against terrorism.
In December, a translator and two members of the Iowa National Guard were killed in an ambush attack by a lone IS gunman in Palmyra, Syria, the Pentagon said.
The Trump administration retaliated with a series of raids against IS, called Operation Hawkeye Strike.

Detained Briton describes life in Iran jail to BBC hours before sentencing,2026-02-19T10:49:47.320Z," Hafsa Khalil
","A British woman who was detained by Iran has told the BBC it was hard to remain positive in prison, hours before she and her husband were sentenced to 10 years for espionage.
Lindsay and Craig Foreman were arrested while passing through Iran on a round-the-world motorcycle trip in January 2025.
In a rare telephone interview from Tehran's notorious Evin prison, Lindsay likened their detainment to ""an endurance test for the mind"" and said being in jail had taken a physical toll on her.
While the couple - who deny the accusation against them - has not spoken since the sentencing, her son described the decision as ""gut-wrenching"".
Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called it ""completely appalling and totally unjustifiable"".
Lindsay, who spoke over a crackly phone line, said she had been trying to exercise within the confines of the cramped Iranian prison, including running ""in circles"" in the small prison yard.
""I've resigned myself to the fact that my physical health might not be what it was when I came in but I can regain it when I leave,"" she said during the interview, which was played on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Lindsay noted it was ""incredibly hard to remain positive"" but was taking things ""one day at a time"".
She added: ""I'm surrounded by people who are in worse situations who have to live this their entire life, so in some way I feel lucky that I've had the life I have until this point - and hopefully one day for me it will end.""
The Foremans had been heading for Australia on their trip of a lifetime, crossing into Iran from Armenia on 30 December 2024 and had planned to arrive in Pakistan by 4 January that year.
But on 3 January, the couple were detained despite having Iranian visas, a guide and an approved itinerary.
Lindsay's son, Joe Bennett, said that no evidence of spying has ever been presented by the Iranian authorities and called on the UK government to ""act decisively and use every available avenue"" to bring them home.
Bennett has said the couple's lawyers in Iran made it clear there was no legal basis for a case against them, but that their bail applications had been ignored. At a court hearing in October, they were not allowed to defend themselves.
The family say a judge delivered their sentence at the Branch 15 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court.
Lindsay said hours before this was handed down that she and her husband had sent a letter to the Iranian authorities to complain about their treatment in what she described as a ""desperate attempt"" to seek justice.
""We have done what we can to be respectful of their system, to be patient with the legal process and believing that our innocence will prevail but it doesn't seem to be the case,"" she said.
Lindsay added that they wanted to ""exercise their right to be heard"" and use Iran's legal system to show what it was doing to them was ""unfair and unjust"".
She said she told them: ""Even in your own system, your own judicial system, you're in violation of the laws.""
The Foremans are being held in separate wings of Evin prison, which has long drawn criticism for alleged torture and inhumane conditions. It reportedly holds thousands of inmates, including journalists and political prisoners.
The Sussex couple, who are both in their 50s, had endured 13 months in ""dire"" conditions, Bennett has previously said - adding that they were surrounded by ""dirt, vermin and violence"".
Human rights groups say foreign nationals who are detained in Iran are often held for leverage and released only when the regime gets something in return. The BBC was previously told that the couple may be being used as diplomatic bargaining chips.
Bennett said he had repeatedly urged the UK Foreign Office to help the Foremans.
He has said that his family felt ""abandoned"" by the government, and that letters he sent to the prime minister and foreign secretary had gone unanswered.
Responding to the sentence, Cooper said: ""We will pursue this case relentlessly with the Iranian government until we see Craig and Lindsay Foreman safely returned to the UK and reunited with their family.
""In the meantime, their welfare is our priority and we will continue to provide consular assistance to them and their families.""
The Foreign Office has long advised against all travel to Iran, warning British and British-Iranian dual citizens that having a British passport or any connection to the UK can lead to detention.
Lindsay told the BBC on Wednesday that she and Craig had checked the government website before entering Iran, and had sought advice on how to travel through a hard-to-navigate region.
""I put my hand up and take responsibility for being here,"" she said.
Iran has arrested dozens of Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency in recent years, mostly on spying and national security charges. At least 15 have had links to the UK.
British-Iranian citizens Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released in 2022 and allowed to leave Iran after the UK settled a long-standing £650m debt owed to Tehran.
French citizens Cécile Kohler, Jacques Paris and Olivier Grondeau, and German national Nahid Taghavi, were all released from Iranian jails following sustained pressure by their respective governments.

What could happen if the US strikes Iran? Here are seven scenarios,2026-02-19T16:53:41.974Z," Frank Gardner
Security correspondent
","The US appears poised to strike Iran.
For weeks, Washington has been building up its forces in the Middle East - and now looks set to assemble more air power in the region than at any time since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
This could, of course, still be a bluff designed to pressure the Iranian regime into a deal they do not want to make. America's Gulf Arab allies are known to have cautioned against a US attack that could have unintended results.
So while the potential targets of a US attack are largely predictable, the outcome is not.
If negotiations fail and President Donald Trump decides to order an attack, then what are the possible outcomes?
US air and naval forces conduct limited, precision strikes targeting military bases of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and the Basij unit - a paramilitary force under the control of the IRGC - ballistic missile launch and storage sites as well as Iran's nuclear programme.
An already weakened regime is toppled, transitioning eventually to a genuine democracy where Iran can rejoin the rest of the world.
This is a highly optimistic scenario. Western military intervention in both Iraq and Libya did not bring a smooth transition to democracy. Although it ended brutal dictatorships in both cases, it ushered in years of chaos and bloodshed.

Can the US help Iran? What Iranians say - inside and outside the country

'We all know someone who was killed' - Iran protesters tell BBC of brutal crackdown
This could broadly be called the ""Venezuelan model"" whereby swift, powerful US action leaves the regime intact but with its policies moderated.
In Iran's case, this would mean the Islamic Republic survived, which won't satisfy large numbers of Iranians, but is forced to curtail its support for violent militias across the Middle East, cease or curtail its domestic nuclear and ballistic missile programmes as well as easing up on its suppression of protests.
Again, this is at the more unlikely end of the scale.
The Islamic Republic leadership has remained defiant and resistant to change for 47 years. It appears incapable of changing course now. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, now well into his 80s, is especially resistant to change or compromise.
Many think this is the most likely possible outcome.
While the regime is clearly unpopular with many, and each successive wave of protests over the years weakens it further, there remains a huge and pervasive security deep state with a vested interest in the status quo. The IRGC, for example, is deeply involved in Iran's economy.
The principal reasons why the protests have so far failed to overthrow the regime is because there have been no significant defections to their side, while those in control are prepared to use unlimited force and brutality to remain in power.
In the confusion of the aftermath of any US strikes it is conceivable that Iran ends up being ruled by a strong, military government composed largely of IRGC figures.
This is highly likely.
Iran vowed last month to retaliate against any US attack, saying that ""its finger is on the trigger"" and Ayatollah Khamenei promised to deliver ""a slap in the face"" to US forces if attacked.
Iran is clearly no match for the might of the US Navy and Air Force but it could still lash out with its arsenal of ballistic missiles and drones, many concealed in caves, underground or in remote mountainsides.
There are US bases and facilities dotted along the Arabian side of the Gulf, notably in Bahrain and Qatar, but Iran could also, if it chose, target some of the critical infrastructure of any nation it considered was complicit in a US attack, such as Jordan or Israel.
The devastating missile and drone attack on Saudi Aramco's petrochemical facilities in 2019, attributed to an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq, showed the Saudis just how vulnerable they were to Iranian missiles.
Iran's Gulf Arab neighbours, all US allies, are understandably extremely jittery right now that any US military action is going to end up rebounding on them.
Last month, Saudi Arabia and the UAE said that they would not allow the US to use their airspace for any attack. That may not necessarily spare them from Iranian retaliation.
This has long loomed as a potential threat to global shipping and oil supplies ever since the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88 when Iran did indeed mine the shipping lanes and Royal Navy minesweepers helped clear them.
The narrow Strait of Hormuz between Iran and Oman is a critical chokepoint. Around 20% of the world's Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) exports and between 20-25% of oil and oil byproducts pass through this strait each year.
As talks over a US-Iran deal took place in Geneva earlier this week, Iran closed the Strait for a few hours to conduct live fire drills - the first time it's been closed since the 1980s, and a symbolic show of force.
On Thursday, it reportedly carried out military drills alongside Russian sailors in the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean.
And it's also conducted exercises in rapidly deploying sea mines. If it did so again then it would inevitably impact world trade and oil prices. The biggest losers in this scenario would be Iran itself, as it relies on oil exports for revenue, and its principle customers in Asia, notably China.
A US Navy Captain onboard a warship in the Gulf once told me that one of the threats from Iran he worries about most is a ""swarm attack"".
This is where Iran launches so many high explosive drones and fast torpedo boats at a single or multiple targets that even the US Navy's formidable close-in defences are unable to eliminate all of them in time.
The IRGC Navy has long replaced the conventional Iranian Navy in the Gulf, some of whose commanders were even trained at Dartmouth during the time of the Shah.
Iran's naval crews have focussed much of their training on unconventional or ""asymmetric"" warfare, looking at ways to overcome or bypass the technical advantages enjoyed by their primary adversary, the US Navy's Fifth Fleet.
The sinking of a US warship, accompanied by the possible capture of survivors among its crew, would be a massive humiliation for the US.
While this scenario is thought unlikely, the billion-dollar destroyer the USS Cole was crippled by an Al-Qaeda suicide attack in Aden harbour in 2000, killing 17 US sailors.
Before that, in 1987 an Iraqi jet pilot mistakenly fired two Exocet missiles at a US warship, the USS Stark, in the Gulf killing 37 sailors.
The US is set to have two carrier strike groups in the region when the USS Gerald R Ford - which is currently transiting the Mediterranean - arrives in the coming weeks.
This is a very real danger and is one of the major concerns of neighbours like Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
As well as the possibility of a civil war, such as experienced by Syria, Yemen and Libya, there is also the risk that in the chaos and confusion, ethnic tensions could spill over into armed conflict as Kurds, Baluchis, Azerbaijanis and other minorities look to safeguard their own people amid a nationwide power vacuum.
Much of the Middle East would certainly be glad to see the back of the Islamic Republic, none more so than Israel which has already dealt heavy blows to Iran's proxies across the region and which fears an existential threat from Iran's suspected nuclear programme.
But nobody wants to see the largest Middle East nation by population - around 93 million - descend into chaos, sparking a humanitarian and refugee crisis.
The greatest danger now is that President Trump, having amassed this powerful force close to Iran's borders, decides he must act or lose face, and a war begins with no clear end-state and with unpredictable and potentially damaging repercussions.

Trump's Board of Peace members pledge $7bn in Gaza relief,2026-02-19T21:33:35.821Z," Amy WalkerandTom Bateman
State department correspondent
Washington DC
","Several countries which have signed up to Donald Trump's Board of Peace have contributed more than $7bn (£5.2bn) towards a Gaza ""relief package"", the US president has said.
Trump made the announcement during the first meeting of the organisation that many of US's Western allies have refused to join, fearing the body originally meant to help end the war between Israel and Hamas may be intended to replace the UN.
The second phase of a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan includes the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza.
It ""looks like"" Hamas would disarm, Trump told participants. However, there are few signs of the Palestinian group disarming. Gazans say it is extending its control over the Strip.
Speaking as the Board of Peace convened on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had ""agreed with our ally the US there will be no reconstruction of Gaza before the demilitarisation of Gaza"".
The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 72,000 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
The enclave's economy is in ruins, with its buildings and infrastructure largely destroyed. The UN estimates the cost of damage at $70bn.
Countries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany have refused to join the Board of Peace that came into being last month.
In an effort to address concerns that the organisation was meant as a way of sidelining the UN, Trump told the board's first meeting in Washington that ""we're going to be working with the United Nations very closely, we're going to bring them back"".
Gaza, the US president said, was ""no longer a hotbed of radicalism and terror"".
""And to end that, we have today, and I'm pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7bn toward the relief package"".
""Every dollar spent is an investment in stability,"" he said, adding that the UN would contribute $2bn for humanitarian assistance, while football body Fifa would raise $75m for soccer-related projects in the Strip.
Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician who has been given the title of high representative for Gaza as part of the board, said the process of recruiting a new transitional Palestinian police force had begun and ""just in the first few hours we have 2,000 people who have applied"".
But both Israel and the US have insisted that the force is not drawn from the existing Hamas-controlled police without stringent vetting, nor do they want it simply made up of the security forces of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
That means starting from scratch, and the task is daunting.
Mladenov has previously said the Palestinian police force must be the primary security agency in Gaza, assisted by the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), and not vice-versa.
According to the US plan, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.
But Mladenov said there is little evidence such a force could yet oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian factions.
Meanwhile, there was no indication at the meeting that Hamas was prepared to hand over its weapons, despite Trump's combination of optimism and threat on this point.
So far, Hamas has publicly appeared to make handing over weapons contingent on - at least - Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
Progress on this issue is critical because none of Trump's proposals for reconstruction and governance can take place without a security force on the ground that has broad backing of the Palestinian population, given its role includes assuming a monopoly of force within Gaza.
The Washington meeting itself was characteristic of Trump's approach to Israeli-Palestinian peace-making over his two terms - involving a future for Palestinians seen often through the lens of real-estate development and wealthy investor funding.
Meanwhile Israel's leadership has been wary about some of Trump's efforts, particularly the invitations to his board for Turkey and Qatar, whom Israel does not want to see take a prominent role in decisions on the future of Gaza.
Trump and his team have defended his unconventional approach saying it amounts to ""new thinking"" to try to solve the conflict.
However, Mladenov has warned that without rapid progress, Gaza will remain split into two territories, one under continuing Israeli occupation and the other under Hamas control - and also split from the West Bank, making a future independent state unviable and failing to secure either Palestinians or Israelis.

Hamas is reasserting control in Gaza despite its heavy losses fighting Israel,2026-02-19T00:04:44.480Z," Lucy Williamson
Middle East correspondent
","When a US-imposed ceasefire halted the Gaza War last October, Hamas's war for survival against Israel switched into a battle for control at home.
The war had left the group's disciplined military units shattered into guerrilla forces, and most of its leaders killed; Gaza's buildings and infrastructure were largely destroyed, its population displaced, and its economic life in ruins. More than 72,000 Gazans were killed by Israeli attacks during the conflict, the Hamas-run health ministry says.
Four months on, Gazans say Hamas is again extending its control over security, tax revenue, and government services, raising questions about its long-term strategy, and whether it is prepared to give up its weapons and authority, as now required under the second stage of Donald Trump's peace plan.
""Hamas regained control of more than 90% of the areas where it is present,"" said Mohammed Diab, an activist in Gaza.
""Its police and security agencies have returned, and are now present in the streets, controlling crime and pursuing those it labels as collaborators and people with opinions. Citizens must go to the Hamas authorities for identity cards or health procedures, and it is also reasserting control over the judiciary and courts.""
At markets across Gaza, stallholders describe regular police patrols – and a renewed iron grip on official fees and taxes.
""The markets are quiet, but the municipality keeps pursuing us for rent,"" one stallholder said. All those we spoke to there about Hamas control in Gaza asked that we hide their identity.
""Every single day they come to us aggressively, with the same demands and the same determination, saying if we don't pay they'll throw us and our goods into the street. They're asking for 700 shekels ($225; £167) – none of us can afford that.""
The stallholder, who spoke to our colleague in Gaza City, said he and his family of 12 had been displaced from Shujaiya to the east of the city, where he used to run a shop. Shujaiya today is a flat wasteland of rubble.
""Every day, the municipality comes,"" said another man selling cigarettes nearby. ""Let them count the stock and the sales, cigarette by cigarette, and tell me: should I pay them, or feed my children?""
Since the ceasefire, food and some other basic goods are flowing into Gaza more freely. The few key traders with a licence to bring them in from Israel say Hamas have reimposed strict control over taxing the imports.
One trader, who agreed to share details anonymously, told us force was used against those who refused to pay.
""The taxes imposed by Hamas depend on the type and quantity of goods, but prices start at 20,000 shekels and above,"" he said. ""If a trader refuses to pay, force is used and in some cases he is kidnapped or threatened. No one can avoid paying taxes on goods.""
He told us that traders used a code-word for Hamas when discussing tax payments, so that Israel wouldn't learn that money was being siphoned off to the group.
""Hamas now has a database of all the traders who import goods into the Gaza Strip,"" said the activist Mohammed Diab. ""The trader pays in cash, not through bank transfers, so that the flow of funds cannot be traced. It is gradually restoring the system that was in place in the past, but away from the spotlight so it can't be monitored.""
A Hamas spokesman, Hazem Qassem, said the Gaza Strip was in a state of emergency and that ""exceptional measures"" were required.
""Some traders maintain links with the [Israeli] occupation and attempt to generate excessive profits, so administrative bodies sometimes need to act firmly with traders who refuse to cooperate or meet required obligations,"" he said. ""This is purely a governmental matter and has no relation to Hamas.""
Gaza's government has been run by Hamas since 2007. Money is crucial to the group's grip on power: to pay salaries – and, the Israeli army alleges, for its ultimate goal of rebuilding its war machine.
""Hamas looks at the ceasefire as a time to regroup, to fight against us,"" said Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). ""This is why it's crucial to see them disarmed because they've made it clear that if they have weapons, they will use them sometime in the future.""
The Israeli army says there are daily attacks against its forces by Hamas. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire began.
Hamas, in turn, points to repeated Israeli attacks, which Gaza's Health Ministry says have killed 603 Palestinians.
The IDF recently released grainy footage of several figures running through Gaza's debris, who it identified as ""armed terrorists"" approaching troops in the area of Gaza temporarily controlled by Israel under Trump's peace plan.
Asked whether two years of intense military conflict had failed to achieve the destruction of Hamas's military capabilities - a key Israeli war goal – Lt Col Shoshani said the group had been heavily diminished, but was now trying to rebuild.
""This war is not done until Hamas is disarmed,"" he said. ""There is an agreement now in place [and] we expect that to happen. If not, there are a lot of tools on the table to make sure that does happen.""
Trump's new Board of Peace, comprising the heads of state from many countries with a stake in Gaza's future, will hold its first meeting in Washington on Thursday.
The next stage of Trump's plan for Gaza – including its reconstruction – hinges on Hamas disarmament, but negotiators are still inching through the detail of what the handover of weapons would mean in practice – who would Hamas hand weapons over to, which weapons would they hand over, and how would that be verified.
""I believe we are capable of addressing the issue of weapons in a way that removes the Occupation's pretext to renew the war and is also compatible with President Trump's plan,"" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told the BBC.
But Hamas, ideologically committed to fighting Israel, has a deeply-rooted and well-armed membership across the Gaza Strip. Verifying its full disarmament will be difficult, and some in the group have reportedly demanded they be allowed to keep personal weapons to defend themselves against enemies at home.
When the fighting with Israel stopped in October, Hamas immediately turned its guns on rival clans who had begun to take advantage of the chaos to extend their power in Gaza City, Rafah and elsewhere.
Footage of the crackdown, including summary executions of blindfolded rivals in the streets, was released to the public.
Israel's leaders have rejected the idea of Hamas keeping personal arms, and have applied pressure on the group to disarm by threatening a return to war.
In the meantime, an International Stabilisation Force to take over security in Gaza remains in limbo, and the new Palestinian technocratic council meant to take over the running of Gaza's civilian affairs is waiting in Egypt.
Earlier this month Hamas said it was ready to ""transfer authority and governance in all fields"" to the new technocratic council.
But the Gaza activist, Mohammed Diab, said there were few signs that Hamas was preparing to hand over power.
""On the contrary,"" he said, ""we heard last week that Hamas carried out large-scale appointments to vacant positions in the government sector, and announced them on social media and official platforms.""
Hazem Qassem denied any new government recruitment, saying that any appointments would have been technical, low-level positions that did not interfere with the handover of power.
Critics have questioned whether they are an attempt to retain influence inside any future Gaza administration.
The recent transfer of medical cases out of Gaza through the newly-reopened Rafah Crossing also signalled the intention of Hamas to remain in control, despite the new process being designed without the group's involvement.
One of those present at an evacuation point run by international aid organisations near Nasser Hospital reported that Hamas ministry officials had shown up on the second day of evacuations to help supervise.
This is now the make-or-break moment for Trump's plan, which has so far kept on track by relentlessly pushing forward, past hiccups and delays.
Despite repeated threats of a return to renewed fighting if Hamas does not fully disarm, some in Israel believe the most effective pressure on Hamas leadership might actually come from moving forward with the plan without them.
Ground has already been cleared in Israeli-held areas around Rafah, ahead of a reported US plan to build new housing facilities for some 200,000 Gazans, with the promise of food, water and medical support to tempt people across the yellow line from Hamas-controlled areas.
Crossing into the large swathe of Israeli-held territory around Gaza's perimeter is seen by many in Gaza as siding with the enemy, and very few have so far made the journey.
But Gaza's population is a key source of Hamas's revenue and control. After two years fighting Israel for control of the land, the battle for Gaza's people might just be starting.

The men beat her, she said, hitting her harder when she started crying and screaming.
""One of them asked if I was Sunni or Alawite. When I said Alawite, they began insulting the sect,"" she added.
Ramia is one of dozens of women reported kidnapped since the fall of the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.
The Syrian Feminist Lobby (SFL), an advocacy group for women's rights, says it has recorded reports - from families, media and other sources - of more than 80 women who have gone missing. It says it has confirmed 26 of those cases to be kidnappings.
Nearly all those reported missing are members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam that makes up about 10% of Syria's population and to which the ousted president belongs.

Two Alawite women and the families of three others have shared details of abduction and assault with the BBC. All their names have been changed for reasons of privacy and safety.
All of them said the interim government's General Security Service - which is responsible for policing - had failed to investigate fully. One says its officers mocked her when she reported her ordeal.
The interior ministry's spokesman said in November that it had investigated 42 alleged kidnappings, and found all but one were ""false"". When contacted by the BBC, it said it had no further comment. However, a security source told the BBC that kidnappings had occurred, including some involving members of the security service, who he said had been dismissed.
The kidnappings and disappearances recorded by the SFL span a period from February 2025 to early December. This is both before and after March, when more than 1,400 people, mostly Alawite civilians, were killed in sectarian violence in the western coastal regions. Forces loyal to the Sunni Islamist-led government were accused of a wave of revenge killings following a deadly ambush by Assad supporters.
Many members of the Assad regime's elite were Alawites, but other members of the sect faced repression for opposing the former president.
Ramia spoke quietly as she described being forced to wear a full body covering and niqab - a veil which leaves just the eye area exposed. She said she was locked in an underground room furnished with a bed and a dresser, on which lay toiletries and a condom.
Held for two days, she tried to escape once and attempted suicide twice, she said.
Her captor did not speak Arabic fluently and had ""Asian features"", she said, adding that he removed her niqab and took photos.
A woman living in the same building, who said she was the captor's wife, explained the photo ""was to determine her price for sale"", Ramia said.
She said the woman told her ""many"" others had been kidnapped before her, and that some had been raped and released, while others had been ""sold"".
The BBC could not verify any cases of money being exchanged for kidnapped women, but activists have reported cases where victims said they were threatened with being sold or forced into marriage.
Nesma, a mother in her 30s, told the BBC she was taken from her village, also in Latakia province, and driven away in a van with curtained windows.
Her voice shook over the phone as she described being held for seven days in a room with high windows that appeared to be in an industrial facility, and interrogated by three men about the residents of her village and any links to the former regime.
She said her captors were all masked and spoke in the Syrian Arabic dialect. She says they told her ""Alawite women were created to be sabaya"" - an archaic Arabic term meaning ""female captives"" and used by some Islamist extremists to refer to women treated as sex slaves.
Her captors raped her multiple times, she said: ""All I could think about was death - that I would die and leave my child without a mother.""
Leen, another teenager, endured beatings, threats at gunpoint and daily sexual assault, her mother Hasna told the BBC.
Her captor kept his face covered, spoke poor Arabic and boasted about taking part in killings of Alawites during March's violence, Hasna said.
""He used to call our girls sabaya, because 'they do not believe in God',"" Hasna says - some Sunni extremists consider Alawites to be heretics.
The BBC also spoke to Ali, who said his wife Noor was kidnapped and held for several weeks, and a mother, Somaya, who said her teenage daughter was sexually assaulted ""for 10 consecutive days"".
Nesma told the BBC that security officers treated her ""mockingly and disrespectfully"" when she went to tell them she had been kidnapped: ""They said to me 'you should say you were on a picnic'.""
Ramia said officers initially seemed engaged with her case, but stopped taking her calls once they identified her captor. The family received threats by phone that they ""would pay a price if we talked"", she said. They decided to flee the country.
Ali told the BBC: ""They arrested the kidnapper, but we don't know what happened next."" He said he was afraid the kidnapper may be released and ""will come after us"".
Leen's mother said her daughter was interviewed ""with interest and sympathy"" several times by security officers, but that no results from investigations were shared, even after months. Somaya says she reported what happened, but received no updates.
In November, Syria's interior ministry, which oversees the General Security Service, held a press conference on its findings on 42 reported kidnappings.
Spokesperson Nour al-Din al-Baba said only one case was a ""genuine kidnapping"". He said the others were explained as ""voluntary elopement,"" ""staying with relatives or friends,"" ""fleeing domestic violence,"" ""false claims on social media"" or ""involvement in prostitution and extortion"", while four were ""criminal offences for which arrests were made"".
The ministry dealt with such reports with ""utmost seriousness and responsibility"", he stressed.
Later in November, the BBC contacted the ministry for its response to the accounts we have gathered. It said it had no further comment.
A security source from a coastal area, speaking to the BBC on condition of anonymity, claimed: ""There are undisciplined actions by some elements who carry out temporary kidnappings for the purpose of financial extortion, or due to recklessness, or personal motives inherited from the time of the previous regime.""
He said this included members of the General Security Service. ""Some officers adopt the idea of kidnapping as a means of revenge,"" he said. ""Some cases have been uncovered, and the officers involved were immediately dismissed.""
Four of the women and families who spoke to the BBC said they did not know who the kidnappers were. One did, and said it was not someone from the security services. Two said they were released after public pressure, the others said they did not know why they were freed.
In July, Amnesty International said it had received credible reports of abductions and kidnappings of at least 36 Alawite women and girls, aged between three and 40, and had documented eight cases in detail.
In ""almost all"" the cases it documented, families ""received no meaningful updates and no credible sense of progress on investigations,"" deputy regional director Kristine Beckerle told the BBC.
Yamen Hussein, a Syrian human rights activist and writer based in Germany who has followed the issue, said survivors' accounts showed the kidnappings had an ideological basis ""built on the notion of violating the defeated side"", and aiming to ""spread fear among Alawite women"".
However, a ""general climate of impunity"" had also encouraged groups with no ideological motive to carry out kidnappings, he added.
According to the Syrian Feminist Lobby, a small number of Druze and Sunni women were reported kidnapped, but were released later. It says 16 women - all of them Alawite - are still missing.
For the families the BBC spoke to, fear persists - both of retribution for speaking out and of social stigma associated with sexual assault.
Leen lives in constant anxiety, fearing knocks at the door, her mother said. Nesma's marriage has collapsed. ""I would scream in my sleep,"" says Ramia. She says she is seeing a therapist but still struggles to sleep and ""can't find comfort"".
Ali told the BBC he and Noor were too afraid to seek justice, while Somaya said her daughter had returned to school, but ""nobody around me knows anything about what happened"".
""We should not deny what happened to us but also we should not expose ourselves to danger,"" she said.

Australian IS families in Syria camp turned back after leaving for home,2026-02-16T19:18:04.147Z," Tom Bennett
","A group of 34 Australian women and children who have been held in a camp in northern Syria for nearly seven years due to their links to the Islamic State (IS) group were released on Monday to head home, but then returned to the camp for ""technical reasons"".
The group - thought by authorities to be the wives and children of IS fighters - have been stuck in Roj detention camp until now, with the Australian government refusing to officially repatriate them.
It is unclear why their release was halted, but Australian media has reported it may have been due to a failure to coordinate the correct permissions between the factions governing the region.
Their future - and that of thousands of other IS relatives in Syria - remains unclear. Other foreign governments have also refused to repatriate their citizens.
Reuters news agency quoted a co-director of Roj camp as saying that the 34 Australians had been handed over to members of their families who had travelled to Syria for their release, and had boarded minibuses to travel to Damascus with a military escort.
Australian media reported that the group were intending to continue their journey to Beirut, where they hoped to be issued passports.
The Australian government has repeatedly said it would not repatriate people from Syria and said those who returned who had committed crimes would be ""met with the full force of the law"".
But it has previously taken the position that it is obliged to issue passports to citizens who present themselves at an Australian embassy.
Roj is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities - mainly women and children - who have been held there since IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria in 2019.
Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.
Speaking to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the camp's director, Hakmiyeh Ibrahim said: ""My message is not only to Australia but to all countries: take your citizens, take these children and women"".
She added that children were growing up surrounded by ""dangerous ideas and ideologies"" in the camp.
""We brought families of ISIS-affiliated women and children here in 2017 and now it's 2026,"" she said. ""The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.""
The Australian government said in a statement: ""Our security agencies have been monitoring - and continue to monitor - the situation in Syria to ensure they are prepared for any Australians seeking to return to Australia"".
""People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law.
""The safety of Australians and the protection of Australia's national interests remain the overriding priority.""
In 2022, another group of Australians, consisting of four women and 13 children, were released from the Roj detention camp and brought back to Sydney, prompting a backlash from some in Australia.
Last month the UK home secretary said she would ""robustly defend"" the decision to remove Shamima Begum's citizenship, according to a government source.
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called for an investigation, but the government source said the decision had already been upheld by UK courts.
Ms Begum was 15 when she travelled from east London to the Middle East, to a territory held by the Islamic State group, where she married a fighter.

"Iran must abandon enriched uranium and not produce more, Netanyahu says",2026-02-16T04:26:53.966Z," Harry Sekulich
","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the US must require Iran to relinquish all of its enriched uranium and be barred from enriching more, as part of any nuclear deal with Tehran.
In a speech in Jerusalem on Sunday, he outlined several conditions he wanted, including that ""all enriched material has to leave Iran"" and that ""there should be no enrichment capability"".
His comments come as Iranian and US officials prepare for a second round of talks in Switzerland on Tuesday.
Iran will consider compromises to reach a nuclear deal if the US is willing to discuss lifting sanctions, Iranian deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC in Tehran.
However, Iran regards zero enrichment as a red line and a violation of its rights under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
The US has piled pressure on Iran to reach a deal and has built up its military capabilities in the Middle East, sending two aircraft carriers – including its largest-ever warship – to the region.
Additional American naval forces will protect against any potential threats in the region, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told a news conference in Slovakia.
He said US President Donald Trump ""prefers diplomacy and an outcome of negotiated settlement"" over direct attacks on Iran.
Trump's top envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner are set to meet Iranian negotiators including Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is travelling to Geneva.
""No-one's ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we're going to try,"" Rubio said.
Under the 2015 nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew, Iran had agreed to limit its nuclear activities and allow international inspections in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.
Ahead of the latest round of talks, Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC Tehran has offered to dilute its 60%-enriched uranium as evidence of its willingness to compromise.
Highly enriched uranium, at near weapons-grade level, has deepened suspicions that the Islamic Republic is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something it has always denied.
""We are ready to discuss this and other issues related to our programme if they are ready to talk about sanctions,"" Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC. He would not confirm whether this meant lifting all or some sanctions.
He also did not say whether Iran would consider agreeing to ship more than 400kg of highly enriched uranium out of the country.
Washington has been pushing for a deal with Tehran, but Netanyahu said he raised ""scepticism"" with Trump during a recent meeting at the White House.
""I said that if a deal is to be reached, it should have several components... that we believe are important not only for the security of Israel, but for the security of the world,"" Netanyahu said.
One of Israel's key demands include curbing Iran's development ballistic missiles, which have been used to strike Israel.
Tehran has so far refused to discuss its ballistic missile programme with US officials.
Israel has also previously called for Iran to cut support for proxy groups in the Middle East, including Hamas and Hezbollah.

Female Israeli soldiers rescued after being chased by ultra-Orthodox men,2026-02-16T07:47:54.460Z," Alicia Curry
","Two female Israeli soldiers had to be rescued by police after being chased by a crowd of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men.
Footage from the city of Bnei Brak showed the women running through streets strewn with rubbish and overturned bins as police officers formed a protective barrier. More than 20 people were arrested.
Reports suggest the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers were wrongly believed to be trying to deliver army conscription orders. Military service is mandatory for most Jewish Israelis, but ultra‑Orthodox Jews have long been exempt. Moves to reform this have caused outrage among the community.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the incident as ""unacceptable"".
""This is an extreme minority that does not represent the entire Haredi [ultra-Orthodox] community,"" Netanyahu said in a post on X.
""We will not allow anarchy, and we will not tolerate any harm to IDF servicemen and security forces who carry out their duties with dedication and determination.""
Jewish religious leaders also condemned the actions of those involved in the unrest.
Riot police in Bnei Brak, on the edge of Tel Aviv, used stun grenades against the crowd and arrested 23 people, police said in a statement.
Three officers were injured and several police vehicles damaged, including a patrol car that was overturned and a police motorcycle that was set on fire, police added.
The IDF servicewomen had been on an official home visit to another soldier when the confrontation broke out, Israeli broadcaster Kan reported.
Late last year, hundreds of thousands of people took part in of one of the biggest anti-conscription protests by ultra-Orthodox Israelis in years.
The issue of conscription has become increasingly contentious during the war in Gaza, with the Israeli government now debating draft legislation that would require ultra-Orthodox men not in full-time religious study to serve.
Since the State of Israel was declared in 1948, students enrolled full-time at a religious school, or yeshiva, have been exempted from conscription.
That exemption was ruled unconstitutional by Israel's High Court of Justice more than a decade ago. Temporary arrangements to continue it were formally ended by the court last year, forcing the government to begin conscripting the community.
The ultra-Orthodox population has more than doubled its share of Israel's population over the past seven decades, and now accounts for 14%.

US-Iran tension: Why Tehran may choose confrontation over 'surrender',2026-02-19T18:26:31.908Z," Amir Azimi
BBC News Persian
","The continued build-up of US military in the Gulf region now points less to signalling and more to preparation.
The arrival of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group near Iranian waters is already a significant move.
Another aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, was last seen near the Strait of Gibraltar and has been heading east to support potential operations. Other assets have also been moved to the region, reinforcing the impression that Washington is assembling layered military options.
Such deployments can serve as leverage in diplomacy. But taken together, they may also suggest that indirect talks between Tehran and Washington have reached a deadlock - one that could be followed by military action if neither side shifts positions.
This raises a fundamental question: why do Iranian leaders, at least publicly, remain defiant in the face of the world's most powerful military and its strongest regional ally in the Middle East?
The answer lies in Washington's stated conditions for talks.
From Tehran's perspective, these demands amount not to negotiation but to capitulation.
They include ending uranium enrichment, reducing the range of ballistic missiles so they no longer threaten Israel, halting support for armed groups across the region, and, as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated, changing the Islamic Republic's treatment of its own citizens.
For the Iranian leadership, these are not secondary policies. They form the core of what it sees as its security architecture.
In the absence of powerful international allies, Tehran has spent decades building what it calls the ""Axis of Resistance"".
It is a network of allied armed groups designed to keep confrontation away from Iran's borders and shift pressure closer to Israel.

Tehran's ballistic missile programme has served as a substitute for an ageing air force and limited access to advanced military technology.
The nuclear programme, while officially described as peaceful, is widely seen as carrying deterrent value.
Even without weaponisation, mastery of the enrichment cycle creates what strategists call ""threshold capability"". It involves infrastructure that would require only a political decision to move toward military use. That latent capacity itself functions as leverage.
Stripping away these elements would, in Tehran's view, dismantle the foundations of its deterrence.
From the perspective of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, accepting such terms could appear more dangerous than risking a limited war with the United States under President Donald Trump. A military confrontation, however costly, may be seen as survivable. Total strategic rollback may not.
Yet the risks embedded in this calculation are profound, and not only for Iran.
Any US campaign could target senior leadership in its opening phase. If Khamenei is killed, it would not only end a more-than three-decade rule but could destabilise succession at a moment of vulnerability.
Strikes on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other security institutions could also weaken the apparatus that recently reasserted control after one of the deadliest and violent crackdowns in the Islamic Republic's history.
Protesters who filled the streets in recent weeks - and withdrew only under overwhelming force - remain deeply disaffected. A sudden blow to the state's coercive machinery could shift the domestic balance in unpredictable ways.
Tehran may assume that Washington's objectives would be limited to degrading nuclear and missile capabilities. But wars rarely unfold according to initial assumptions. Miscalculation over targets, duration or political fallout could quickly expand the conflict.
Economic pressures add another layer of risk. Iran's economy, already strained by sanctions, inflation and declining purchasing power, would struggle to absorb further shocks. Disruption to oil exports or damage to infrastructure would compound public anger that has been suppressed rather than resolved.
In this context, defiance serves multiple purposes. It signals resolve externally and projects strength internally. But it also narrows space for compromise.
Washington's risks are no less real.
On paper, the US military has the capacity to fulfil the commander-in-chief's objectives if tensions escalate. But wars are not fought on paper. They are shaped by miscalculation, escalation and unintended consequences.
The recent 12-day war with Israel exposed vulnerabilities in Iran's command structure and military infrastructure. It also offered lessons in adaptation, how to absorb strikes, recalibrate and respond under pressure.
A broader confrontation could produce outcomes neither side intends. A weakened central authority in Tehran would not automatically translate into stability or alignment with Western interests. Power vacuums can generate new, fragmented or radicalised centres of influence, complicating the regional balance in ways that are undesirable for Washington and its allies.
Ayatollah Khamenei now faces few favourable options. Accepting Washington's conditions risks hollowing out the regime's deterrent strategy. Rejecting them increases the likelihood of confrontation at a time of internal fragility.
Between what he may see as the ""worst"" option; strategic surrender, and the ""best of the worst"", a limited but containable war, Tehran appears, at least publicly, to be leaning toward the latter.

Machine guns to machetes: Weapons that massacred thousands in Iran,2026-02-09T17:03:49.354Z," Farzad Seifikaran
BBC News Persian
","Warning: The following story contains graphic details of violence which some readers might find upsetting.
A BBC News Persian analysis of hundreds of videos and photographs taken during recent protests in Iran confirms the security forces' use of a wide range of weaponry, including machine guns, sniper rifles and shotguns.
Protesters were reportedly killed in many of the more than 200 cities where protests had been recorded. While the exact death toll remains unclear, the level of brutality and the deployment of lethal weaponry evidenced in pictures, witness accounts and reports by human rights groups and the media show thousands have been killed across the country.
The crackdown on protests - which began over the economy but rapidly escalated - employed a level of violence unprecedented in modern Iranian history.
""This is the largest mass killing in contemporary Iranian history and one of the largest in the world,"" Payam Akhavan, an Iranian Canadian former UN prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, in The Hague, told BBC News Persian.
The Iranian government has blamed the killings on ""rioters and terrorists"".
But BBC News Persian analysis shows security forces used a number of different weapons on protesters, including:
machine guns
sniper rifles
assault rifles
shotguns
handguns
pellet-firing paintball guns
tear gas
machetes
knives
batons
large wooden clubs
green laser sights and pointers (for blinding and targeting)
Footage from cities such as Tehran, Isfahan, Yazdanshahr, and Shahsavar, verified by BBC News Persian, shows both heavy - such as the DShK - and medium - such as the PK - machine guns mounted on military pickup trucks.
The security forces reportedly used these for crowd control and to impose a state of siege.
The Vahid Online Telegram channel shared two photographs of a black pickup truck with a machine gun mounted in the back in Tehran's Sadeghiyeh Square on the night of 8 January.
BBC News Persian cross-referenced these with photos, published by Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency, of a 2025 military parade, showing nearly identical Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) pickups equipped with the same weapon. Weapons expert Amael Kotlarski, of Janes defence-intelligence company, has identified it as the DShKM model, produced under licence in Iran.
A video of the 9 January protests in Yazdanshahr, published by the Iran International television network, clearly shows protesters coming under sustained machine-gun fire. The gun's massive muzzle fire is visible at the 46-second mark.
A representative of Thames Valley Guns, a UK-based company specialising in the expert analysis of military firearms, also told BBC News Persian vehicles equipped with DShK machine guns could be seen in the videos of the protests.
In one verified video, someone displays two spent cartridge casings from a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle and one large spent shell, explaining security forces had fired them at protesters in Tehran's Behesht Square.
Thames Valley Guns confirmed the large black projectile was a 20mm automatic cannon round designed to be used against military hardware. And rifling marks on its driving band confirm it had been fired.
""Ammunition of this nature is intended to defeat structures, vehicles and hardened targets, including lightly armoured personnel carriers,"" the representative said.
""They are not engineered for use against personnel, though the consequences of such a strike on a human would be catastrophic.""
Witnesses have told BBC News Persian sniper rifles were widely used during the January protests and this is confirmed by the verified footage.
One of the videos verified by BBC News Persian, of the 9 January protests in the north-eastern city of Mashhad, shows two figures in black tactical uniforms of the type worn by several branches of the security forces, including the IRGC, on a hotel rooftop. And one of them has a Dragunov sniper rifle (SVD) leaning against a wall next to him.
In an interview with Iranian state television, a forensic expert confirmed snipers had killed protesters. On 8 January, a relative of Ebrahim Pourahmadian, from Saqqez, in the western province of Kurdistan, who was in Tehran, working as the caretaker of a building, told BBC News Persian a sniper had shot him in the head, right in front of his child.
And photographs obtained by BBC News News Persian of Pourahmadian's body confirm a single precision gunshot wound, in the middle of his forehead.
The Thames Valley Guns representative explained the profound psychological impact of a well positioned sniper. ""For untrained civilians, the effect is even more severe,"" the representative said. ""Most people have no understanding of how to respond to a distant, unseen threat — and the resulting fear certainly triggers mass panic.""
The Kalashnikov assault rifle is the standard-issue weapon for all military and law-enforcement branches in Iran. And BBC News Persian has analysed numerous videos showing members of both the police and the IRGC using using AK-47 Kalashnikovs and the Iranian-produced KL variants.
One, from the northern city of Amol, on 9 January, shows a security officer aiming and firing a Kalashnikov directly at protesters. And after analysing exclusive images obtained by BBC News Persian of spent casings recovered from the streets, Kotlarski confirmed they were 7.62x39mm rounds - the specific calibre for Kalashnikov-type rifles.
BBC News Persian's investigation confirms the extensive use of shotguns.
Verified footage from the western city of Lordegan, on 1 January, and Abadan, also in the west, on 7 January, shows police officers with shotguns deployed on streets during protests. And Kotlarski identified several models, including the Iranian-made Maher shotgun in both standard and short-barrelled configurations.
As we saw during the crackdown on the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom protests, the widespread use of shotguns in January resulted in the killing of many protesters and left hundreds, if not thousands, more with permanent eye injuries.
Between 9 and 10 January, about 1,000 patients needing emergency surgery for ruptured eyeballs caused by metal pellets arrived at a single eye hospital alone, its head, Dr Ghasem Fakhraei, told the semi-official Iranian Students' News Agency.
And BBC News Persian has obtained CT scans and medical records of several wounded protesters from Mashhad, one of which clearly shows a metal pellet embedded in the eye tissue.
In two videos from Kermanshah, on 8 January, plainclothes security forces agents are seen wielding at least two types of pistols, which, analysts suggest, resemble the Beretta Model 50 or CZ 75.
Numerous protesters have told BBC News Persian they were attacked with knives and machetes. Photographs obtained by BBC News Persian of the bodies also reveal machete as well as bullet wounds
CCTV footage from Tehran clearly shows plainclothes agents attacking protesters seeking refuge in a block of flats with machetes.
Another video from the capital, on 8 January, shows a plainclothes officer hitting a female protester in the head with a machete. Several other security personnel in military uniforms are also visible.
Videos and interviews carried out by BBC News Persianwith the survivors show people being beaten with batons. BBC News Persian verified that one protester, Saghar Seifollahi Fars, was killed in this way and another, Ali Taherkhani, who was first shot, died not because of bullet wounds but from being beaten afterwards by batons and gun butts.

Can the US help Iran? What Iranians say - inside and outside the country,2026-02-07T02:03:39.880Z," Leyla Khodabakhshi

","For Mojdeh and her husband, the question of US intervention in Iran is personal.
In early January, they travelled from their home in Washington, DC to Tehran to visit family - expecting a short, routine trip. Instead, protests spread, flights were cancelled and they found themselves stranded in a city that no longer felt predictable.
""Life was on pause,"" Mojdeh said, especially at night, when the internet and even phone networks went dark.
They did not plan to protest. But on the nights of 7 and 8 January, she said, it was impossible to remain uninvolved.
""If you left your house, you saw it,"" she said. The BBC has changed her name to protect her and her husband's identities.
One evening, after eating in a restaurant, they stepped outside to find the city transformed: Crowds filled the streets and in some areas, security forces appeared to have lost control.
""It felt like people had occupied Tehran,"" she said.
Protests erupted across Iran just before the new year, driven by anger over economic hardship and a collapsing currency, but quickly escalated into calls for an end to the Islamic Republic. Days later, security forces responded with deadly force.
The true death toll is difficult to verify, due to an internet blackout in Iran and the lack of independent reporting. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it confirmed more than 6,000 protesters dead, while Norway-based Iran Human Rights said the final toll could exceed 25,000. Iranian authorities said at least 3,117 people were killed, but claimed most were members of security forces or bystanders, blaming the deaths on ""rioters.""
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced support for Iranian protesters. On Friday, US and Iranian officials held talks, though expectations remain low. Onboard Air Force One later in the day, Trump said the talks were ""very good"", and that Iran ""looks like it wants to make a deal very badly"".
Mojdeh's voice faltered as she described her homeland during the protests: people running, shouting, beaten - scenes that stayed with her long after they managed to leave Iran.
Her husband was shocked for another reason: Among friends and family in Iran, the idea of US military involvement was not considered an attack, he said. It was ""help"".
The couple, living safely in the US, understand the desperation, but remain sceptical that such action could deliver what protesters ultimately want - not just regime change, but dignity, economic security and freedom.
From a distance, they worry about the cost of mistaking destruction for salvation.
Weeks after the deadly crackdowns on anti-government protests and the near-total internet blackout, Iranians inside and outside the country still wrestle with whether the US should intervene.
Shirin, an Iranian-American living in California, said she still hopes for foreign intervention.
""If the international community truly wants to stop the violence and prevent further global instability, action is required,"" said Shirin, 52, who asked that her surname not be published, fearing for family in Iran.
""When the head of the snake is not cut off, the venom spreads — beyond borders, beyond regions, beyond generations.""
But some Iranians worry that intervention could hurt their loved ones still living under the regime.
Roozbeh Farahanipour, once imprisoned in Iran for his student activism and now a restaurant owner in Los Angeles, told the BBC he's ""constantly worried"" about US intervention.
""I don't know how many have been killed, how many are injured, or who is missing. I don't know how to reach mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, wives, husbands, or children to offer condolences and express solidarity,"" he said.
There should be global help, he said, but he remembers the risks and history of US intervention. Ultimately, regime change should come from within, he said.
""Today, the greatest power relies in unity, discipline, determination, and mass public mobilisation — building overwhelming crowds and actively calling on the remaining bases of the regime to defect and join the people's movement. That internal collapse is far more decisive than any outside force,"" said Farahanipour.
Ali, 43, was born in Iran and has lived in the US for 21 years. For much of his adult life, he supported reform within Iran's political system and voted mostly for moderate US presidential candidates. Around 2014, he said, he gave up.
""We've seen this before,"" Ali said — protests, promises, crackdowns — pointing back to 2009 and earlier uprisings in Iran. He asked that his last name not be shared.
Each time, he said, people were killed and little changed. In his view, the regime cannot be reformed — and without outside pressure, it cannot be defeated.
He is not calling for a full-scale invasion, but for targeted strikes aimed at state infrastructure and key leaders rather than civilians. He argued that attacking a regime at the request of its people is different from attacking a country outright.
Many of those he knows in Iran now want some form of US intervention - not because they trust American motives, but because they see no other way.
Hemad Nazari, an Iranian activist and photographer who left the country in 2015 and now lives in Denmark, echoes that belief.
""How are we going to negotiate with this regime?"" said Nazari, 36.
Foreign intervention could change the balance, he said. ""The best time [to intervene] was a month ago. The second-best time is now.""
Nazari, who is not affiliated with any organisation or political group, created a network to share firsthand accounts from Iran, particularly during protests and internet blackouts. During blackouts, people in Iran messaged him through alternative channels, like Starlink. Nazari then shares their stories on his own social media platforms, including on X where he has over 21,000 followers.
Because Nazari's network, started in 2019, has grown so large, he said he cannot return to Iran, fearing arrest. He's received more than 500 direct messages just in the last few weeks, he said.
The people he speaks to in Iran feel intervention is the only option, said Nazari. ""They say, 'we went to the streets. We got killed. There is no other way.'""
Many believe, he added, that even though civilians could die, without intervention, nothing will change.
Even as protests have quieted, repression continues in other forms.
Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO), a nonpartisan human rights organisation, estimates that at least 40,000 people have been arrested since the protests began. The group said it has ""serious concern"" about the conditions of the missing or detained, including some denied access to lawyers and others held in unknown locations.
Both IHRNGO and the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) claim they've heard reports that security forces are raiding medical centres and arresting staff who helped wounded protesters. But, HRANA notes that the head of Iran's Medical Council Organization claimed ""no physician has been arrested for treating protesters"".
The internet blackout has only partially eased, but many services remain unreliable or blocked.
For Iranians at home and abroad, the debate over US involvement is no longer theoretical. It is shaped by grief, fear and exhaustion — and by a growing sense that time may be running out.
It's been difficult to watch the events of the last month from so far away, said Shirin.
""It's painful - as an Iranian, but also as a human being,"" she said. ""And it's not even about our family - it's 90 million people we're worried about.""

Why Prince William's Saudi Arabia visit is a diplomatic maze,2026-02-08T00:50:06.049Z," Daniela Relph
Senior royal correspondent
","""He didn't flinch when the request came in.""
These are the words of a royal source, when asked if Prince William had shown any resistance to the UK government's request for him to visit Saudi Arabia.
""He takes his role as Prince of Wales very seriously, so when the government asks, he goes,"" the source told me.
But this trip - the prince's first to Saudi - is something of a diplomatic maze.
Previous official visits to Estonia, Poland, Brazil and South Africa have not been as sensitive - Saudi Arabia is a whole different ballgame.
Arriving on Monday, the trip will focus on energy transition and young people - key areas of development in a country undergoing significant change.
Prince William is visiting a Saudi Arabia that looks very different to the one his grandmother travelled to during her 70-year reign. The regime remains authoritarian and led by an absolute monarchy, but culturally, society has been opening up and the country is trying to develop its economy beyond a reliance on oil.
The list of high profile entertainment and sporting events on Saudi soil is expanding, like the Riyadh Comedy Festival, which last year featured an all-star - and predominantly male - line up of heavyweights including Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart and Bill Burr.
Also on the calendar is the Red Sea International Film Festival in Jeddah, the Saudi Formula One Grand Prix and, in 2034, it will host the men's football World Cup - one of the highest profile events in sport.
Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have accused Saudi leaders of using sport and comedy to whitewash its human rights record. The kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has previously said he ""doesn't care"" how it is labelled, as long as it is good for the Saudi economy.
Meeting Mohammed bin Salman will be an important element of Prince William's visit. Known by his initials, MBS, the crown prince is Saudi Arabia's de facto leader and a controversial figure.
William will be thoroughly briefed before this trip.
He will know about Saudi's human rights record, where same-sex relationships are criminalised and public protest and political dissent are punished. William will also be aware of the role of women and how they are treated in the country - while it has given women more freedom in recent years (in 2018 they were allowed to drive for the first time in decades), there are still enormous limitations compared with men.
And, importantly, William will have also been briefed on the reputation and history of MBS.
Will he bring up these topics in his discussions with the crown prince?
Kensington Palace will not comment on plans for private conversations, but it is hard to imagine, taking into account the diplomatic sensitivities, that William will not touch on some difficult subjects during their private audience.
He will be guided by the Foreign Office in London and the British Embassy in Saudi Arabia which will help him navigate any discussions with an eye on positive outcomes for the UK.
The visit comes after a challenging seven days for the Royal Family, as the Epstein files continue to bring further embarrassment.
The latest release has heaped further damage on the British royals, and sped up the move of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from his Royal Lodge mansion, where he lived for more than 20 years, to the Sandringham Estate.
It is far from the ideal backdrop for a big international trip, but sources say Saudi Arabia is the number one request of the UK government, which wants to strengthen ties with MBS.
To do so, it is using a member of the Royal Family who it feels can make an impact.
""He is a diplomatic secret weapon – a formidable tool for the government to deploy,"" a source explained.
Prince William, who has talked about his own vision of a modern monarchy, is going to a country in transition.
""Saudi Arabia has been opening up massively over the past decade,"" said Dr Neil Quilliam from the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House, the international think tank.
""This younger generation of policy makers are much more transactional than their forefathers, there is greater competition for Saudi investment in the UK,"" he explained.
""The Saudis really like and appreciate being recognised and deploying Prince William sends a signal that says we really value you.""
But the images we'll see this week of William with MBS will be hard to stomach for many.
A 2021 US intelligence report found that the Saudi crown prince approved the murder of exiled Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.
The report, released by the Biden administration, said MBS approved a plan to either ""capture or kill"" Khashoggi.
Saudi Arabia rejected the report, calling it ""negative, false and unacceptable"" and MBS has denied any role in the murder.
Amid the moves to modernisation, what hasn't changed is the Saudi authorities' attitude to its critics - both within the kingdom and abroad.
In January, a judge in a UK court ruled that Saudi Arabia should pay Ghanem al-Masarir damages of more than £3m.
The London based YouTuber and satirist had used his online voice to attack the Saudi regime. He told the court that he'd been followed, assaulted and had his phone bugged by agents acting for the kingdom, and that as a result he suffered psychological damage.
The judges agreed with him.
Despite his experience, al-Masarir is not against Prince William's visit, but urges the UK's future king not to hold back.
""I understand why he is going - to strengthen Saudi-UK relations. I have no problem with him going… Prince William has a privileged place and opportunity to speak to Mohammed bin Salman,"" al- Masarir said.
""But to see them up there shaking hands - it is not real,"" he continues. ""Prince William will be standing next to a guy, who we know the CIA has said ordered the killing of Khoshaggi… it's something you cannot comprehend"".
The murder of Jamal Khashoggi and public opinion of Saudi's human rights record does not appear to have limited the courting of MBS by world leaders - William joins an illustrious list of visitors.
A look back through the recent guests says a lot about the influence of Saudi Arabia – US President Donald Trump, France's Emmanuel Macron, Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, and the UK's own Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.
Even Joe Biden, who once pledged to make Saudi Arabia a ""pariah"" over its human rights violations, then travelled to Jeddah, amid a storm of criticism, to meet the crown prince in 2022.
It is the dilemma of being in the room even when some aspects of that country's leadership don't hold with your beliefs.
This is what the British Royal Family has traditionally excelled at - the view that if you build relationships and strong ties, you then open the door for the government to more easily address the problematic and sensitive subjects. That is the soft power of monarchy.
This is also a trip that brings together two royal families.
William's father, King Charles, has visited Saudi often, both publicly and privately, and maintains a warm relationship with the current generation of Saudi royals.
""King Charles loves the desert and he spends a lot of time there in Saudi Arabia, painting and looking at the wildlife and likes the beauty,"" a former British senior diplomat to Saudi Arabia told me.
""There is a special link between the two royal families… there is affection between the two Kingdoms and a lot of shared history.""
This will be another stage in what those who work with Prince William call his development as a global statesman.
His job will be to smooth the way, to solidify relationships in a region of huge strategic importance to the UK.

Gazans returning through Rafah crossing describe checks by Palestinian militia,2026-02-06T20:27:57.538Z," Lucy Williamson
Middle East correspondent
JerusalemandRushdi Abualouf
Gaza correspondent
Istanbul
","Two Gazan women who passed through the newly reopened Rafah crossing with Egypt on Monday have told the BBC that a local Palestinian militia linked to Israel carried out checks at an Israeli military checkpoint inside the Gaza Strip.
Lamia Rabia, who was travelling with her children, said they were escorted by Israeli forces from the border to a nearby checkpoint where members of the Abu Shabab militia, also known as the Popular Forces, searched them and their belongings.
""There was a woman from the Abu Shabab group who conducted the searches on the women,"" she told the BBC.
""They didn't speak with us, they only searched us and then we went to the Israelis, who questioned us.
""The Israelis and the Abu Shabab group were together at the same point.""
The BBC asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) about these claims and whether they were coordinating with a local militia group in this way - they said they were unable to comment.
Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency has also been approached for comment, but the BBC has not received a response so far.
The Abu Shabab militia is an anti-Hamas group that receives support and weapons from Israel, and operates in the Rafah area under Israeli military control.
Ghassan al-Dheini, head of the militia, was quoted in Israeli media on Monday as saying his unit would play ""an important security role regarding entry and exit through the Rafah crossing"".
Asked how they could be sure the checks were carried out by Abu Shabab, one of the women the BBC spoke to said they had introduced themselves.
The BBC has not been able to reach the militia leaders to confirm their involvement directly.
One of the women, who the BBC is not naming in order to protect her identity, said that the group told her they would help her travel to Europe if she co-operated.
She also said she was mistreated by the militia, alleging that she was beaten and strip-searched along with three other women, and that they had been handcuffed and verbally abused.
Rabia said her experience of the process had been easy with no negative effects.
The European Union, which has monitors at the crossing to check people who are leaving, is reportedly considering whether to escort new arrivals to the Israeli checkpoint, after reports of harsh treatment there.
Both the women the BBC spoke to also said that EU officials working with Palestinians inside the Rafah crossing had confiscated a wide variety of their belongings.
""They took perfumes, accessories, make-up, cigarettes, headphones - everything, they didn't leave anything with us,"" one woman told the BBC.
""The Europeans took from us anything that was liquid, like a cough syrup,"" said Rabia. ""They also took from us perfumes, and make-up, as well as phones and power banks. Any toy with a remote-control was taken.""
Rabia said there was also a limit on the amount of money each person could carry into Gaza, set at $600 (£438).
Anouar El Anouni, EU Spokesman for Foreign Affairs, said EU Border Assistance Mission to Rafah personnel were present at the crossing only to monitor the Palestinian-run operations there, and were not confiscating any items.
""The list of items that are authorised to enter into Gaza is part of the overall agreement process between the Israelis, Egyptians, and the Palestinians,"" she said, adding any unauthorised items would be confiscated by Palestinian officials.
Fifty patients were due to return to Gaza through Rafah on Monday after completing treatment in Egypt. They arrived at the Egyptian side of the crossing in the early hours of the morning, with their accompanying relatives.
But only 12 people made it across, despite all passenger names being screened by both Egyptian and Israeli security in advance.
A Palestinian employee working on the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing said that the patients and their companions arrived from Egypt, and that Palestinian staff and European monitors completed security checks, passport checks and stamping procedures.
Speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media, he said the travellers then waited for several hours inside the crossing compound, before Israeli authorities called forward only 12 people - nine women and three children - escorting them to an Israeli inspection point.
The remaining passengers were ordered to return to Egypt, without explanation.
Eight of them were the relatives of Awad Abu Talha. He had waited for his cousins all day and evening as they progressed slowly through the crossing. Some had made it through to the Palestinian side, before all were sent back to Egypt, because of a technical problem.
On Tuesday afternoon, his family finally managed to cross into Gaza.
Confusion and obscurity has surrounded the reopening of the Rafah crossing.
The Israeli government organisation responsible for civilian liaison in Gaza (Cogat) has not responded to repeated requests to confirm the number of people who crossed in and out of Rafah on Monday.
The World Health Organization said that five patients and seven companions were transferred out of Gaza for medical care on Monday, adding that it was a drop in the ocean of the 18,500 Gazans needing medical evacuations.
""It's a start of a process,"" said its spokesperson, Christian Lindmeier. ""We're hoping this is increasing and turning into a process where many more of those who need medical evacuations can actually leave.""
The Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza said the number of evacuations had risen slightly on Tuesday, with 16 patients and 40 companions leaving the territory.
Its spokesman, Raed al-Nims, accused Israel of delaying procedures, and called on the international community to put pressure on Israel to increase the flow of patients.
The new travel mechanism through the Rafah crossing has also become a real test of Hamas control in Gaza, highlighting the difficulty of excluding the group from the territory's affairs.
And the new procedures at Rafah - which bypass Hamas - are showing signs of weakening under pressure from the militant group to reassert control.
On Monday, evacuees assembled in Gaza at a medical point 4km (2.5 miles) from Nasser Hospital, in Khan Younis. The hospital itself is under the authority of Gaza's Hamas-controlled health ministry.
On Tuesday, Palestinian officials and local journalists said members of the health ministry had unexpectedly appeared at the medical point, along with representatives from Hamas's media office and interior ministry, and that they had begun intervening directly in preparations for the second day of evacuations.
These developments have also exposed the limited role currently played by the new National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which has played no part in the evacuation process despite being designated as Gaza's new temporary administrators under US President Donald Trump's plan.
The reopening of Rafah signals the start of a new and difficult phase of that plan, hinging on the disarmament of Hamas, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and the authority and control of a new administration.
The disagreements, fractures and confusion around Rafah are a warning of the tougher challenges that lie ahead.

"Hamas holds vote to choose new interim leader, source tells BBC",2026-02-20T00:37:14.064Z," Rushdi Abualouf
Gaza correspondent
Istanbul
","Hamas is holding an election for a new interim leader, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the armed group's affairs has told the BBC.
Voting is taking place across Gaza, the occupied West Bank and among Hamas's members elsewhere.
The outcome may signal which direction the movement intends to take - particularly as the US and other mediators discuss post-war governance of Gaza, reconstruction efforts and the future status of armed groups there.
The elections come after most of Hamas's senior leadership were killed in Israeli strikes following the group's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage.
People in Gaza have already cast their votes in secret, according to the source, but it is unclear whether the process has concluded elsewhere. When announced, the new leader will hold office for a year.
Hamas governs the Gaza Strip and in recent years has had growing support in the West Bank, though its activities there are heavily constrained by the Israeli military and Palestinian Authority security forces.
A US-backed ceasefire in Gaza came into effect in October, and negotiations continue over the deal's later phases.
Under the proposed terms of the US plan, Hamas would have no role in the future governance of the territory. Governance would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, once it has undergone reforms.
Yahya Sinwar, the overall head of Hamas, was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza in October 2024, and its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an Israeli attack in Iran in July that year. Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif was also killed that July, in an Israeli air strike on Gaza.
The position of overall head of Hamas has remained vacant since the deaths of Haniyeh and Sinwar, with the movement being led by an interim committee headed by Qatar-based Mohammad Darwish after the latter was killed.
Under the movement's rules, the head of Hamas is chosen by an electoral college of around 86 members drawn from the General Shura Council, Hamas's top decision-making body representing Gaza, the West Bank, Palestinian prisoners in Israel, and officials based abroad.
According to the official, the race is primarily between:
Khalil al-Hayya, who leads Hamas in Gaza and is widely seen as aligned with Sinwar and Haniyeh
Khaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas abroad and one of the movement's veteran figures, who previously served as its overall leader for nearly two decades
Meshaal is currently thought to reside in Doha, Qatar.
Other internal discussions have included additional names, but no formal shortlist has been announced.
The war that followed Hamas's 7 October attack has had a deep impact on the movement's internal politics. Israeli strikes have killed senior Hamas figures and significantly diminished the group's military and political structures, weakening the influence of its Gaza-based leadership.
More than 72,000 people have been killed in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says, though it does not distinguish between civilians and fighters.
For years, Hamas has been shaped by a persistent internal rivalry between two broad currents.
One, often described as aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, and represented by Meshaal and parts of the external leadership, is viewed by observers as more pragmatic and less ideologically rigid.
The other was seen as closer to Iran, a vital Hamas ally that supplies financial backing and weaponry, and was represented most prominently by Sinwar and leaders inside Gaza.
In 2017, when Haniyeh became head of the political bureau and Sinwar assumed leadership inside Gaza, decision-making shifted heavily towards the territory.
The recent war, however, appears to have reopened space for figures from the movement's so-called ""old guard"", traditionally linked to Meshaal.
Under Hamas's internal regulations, its political leadership is composed of 18 members: six representing Gaza, six representing the West Bank and prisoners, and six representing Hamas abroad.
Figures associated with the ""old guard"" appear to be regaining more prominence after years of Gaza-dominated decision making, according to officials familiar with the discussions.
With Gaza devastated by years of conflict and its political landscape in flux, the selection of a new leader is seen as a critical step in determining how Hamas navigates mounting internal and external pressures in the year ahead.

Iran security official appears to fire on crowd at cemetery,2026-02-18T18:14:39.735Z," Jake Horton
Ghoncheh HabibiazadandSarah Jalali
","Crowds of mourners appear to have been fired on by a security official at a cemetery in Iran.
The incident happened in Abdanan, in west Iran, on Tuesday as people gathered to commemorate those killed during the government's brutal crackdown on protesters last month.
Iranians usually hold commemoration ceremonies on the 40th day after someone dies. The events have been held in several cities across the country to mourn the thousands killed during the deadliest nights of protests on 8 and 9 January.
Verified video also shows people shouting anti-government chants at events in Tehran, Mashhad and Abdanan on Tuesday as crowds gathered at cemeteries and in the streets for commemorations.
State-organised ceremonies were broadcast on TV and attended by senior government and military officials where people were led by organisers to chant ""death to America"".
BBC Verify and BBC Persian have verified footage of people chanting ""death to Khamenei"", referencing Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
An armoured vehicle is then seen driving past the crowd of mourners as an apparent security official opens fire. People are heard screaming and seen fleeing the area as two gunshots ring out.
The person who appears to be in uniform is seen pointing the gun away from the camera when the first shot is fired, before pointing the gun towards the crowd when a second shot can be heard. A puff of smoke near the gun is visible after each shot.
Another verified video from the cemetery shows smoke in the distance as people run away from the scene and several gunshots can be heard.
State-run IRIB News claimed that the event was peaceful and reports of people injured or killed were not true.
A billboard in the background of one the videos shows a picture of Alireza Seydi, a teenager from Abdanan who was understood to have been killed during the protests in Tehran last month and appears to be one of those commemorated during the ceremony.
Weeks of anti-government protests started in late December which began over the economy but rapidly escalated. It peaked on 8 and 9 January after Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, called for nationwide protests to take place.
Thousands of people were killed in one of the deadliest government crackdowns in recent years. BBC Verify previously reported that it had spread to more than 68 towns and cities across the country.
The number of people killed during the protests is not fully known, but US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has confirmed the deaths of 7,015 people, and the arrests of more than 53,000.
Khamenei last month acknowledged that thousands had been killed during the protests and blamed the US for the deaths.

"Eleven killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, rescuers say",2026-02-15T18:42:42.721Z," Joel Gunter
in JerusalemandFiona Nimoni
","Eleven people were killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza on Sunday morning, according to Palestinian civil defence and health officials.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said a strike on a tent encampment in northern Gaza killed at least six people, while another strike in the south of the strip killed five.
The Israel Defense Forces said it had struck terror targets in response to ceasefire violations by Hamas, and that militants had been killed after emerging from a tunnel into the area of the strip controlled by the Israeli military.
Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations of the ceasefire agreement since it took effect on 10 October.
Gaza's Civil Defence said 11 people had been killed in the strikes, while staff at the Al-Shifa hospital said a 12th person was killed in an exchange of gunfire, separate from the air strikes.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has said at least 600 people have been killed since the ceasefire went into effect.
At least 32 people were killed in a wave of Israeli air strikes across Gaza earlier this month, according to local officials.
The latest strikes came as the preparations continued for the implementation of the second phase of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement.
Last month, US President Donald Trump announced a new body called the Board of Peace, which has a mandate from the United Nations Security Council to establish an international force tasked with securing border areas in Gaza, and overseeing the disarmament of Hamas.
The board, which is due to have its first meeting in Washington on 19 February, will also oversee the formation of a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza and post-war reconstruction.
Ahead of the talks, Trump said on Sunday that members of the board had pledged $5bn (£3.6bn) to the Palestinian territory's reconstruction.
In a post on his Truth Social platform, he also repeated calls for Hamas to move forward with disarmament. Hamas has previously rejected disarmament, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state had been established.
Last week it was announced that Indonesia, a Board of Peace member, would deploy 8,000 soldiers to Gaza to help facilitate phase two of the ceasefire agreement.
The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.
Elsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Washington on Wednesday to meet US President Donald Trump, where they discussed ways to curb Iran's nuclear programme - which Tehran has always insisted is for purely civilian purposes.
Netanyahu was expected to press Trump to pursue an agreement that would halt Iran's uranium enrichment, as well as cutting its ballistic missile programme.
However, Trump later said there was ""nothing definitive reached"" and that talks with Iran would continue.
Iran's deputy foreign minister told BBC News further talks would take place in Geneva on Tuesday. An unnamed US official confirmed the date to Reuters news agency.

Hundreds of thousands join Iran protests around the world,2026-02-15T13:35:26.649Z," Fiona NimoniandParham Ghobadi
BBC Persian
","Hundreds of thousands of people took part in demonstrations around the world against the Iranian government on Saturday, following calls from the exiled son of the late shah for a ""global day of action"".
Addressing an estimated 250,000 people in Munich, Reza Pahlavi - who has called for the overthrow of Iran's Islamic regime - denounced a crackdown on recent protests there.
Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto saw the largest crowds, with smaller protests in cities including Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Sydney and London.
Activists say more than 6,000 people were killed after joining nationwide protests in Iran against the rising cost of living and the government. Thousands more deaths are being investigated.
Pahlavi told the crowd: ""My first message is to our brave and fighting compatriots inside the country: know that you are not alone, and today the world stands with you in this struggle.""
Criticising Iran's leadership, he said: ""In contrast to this corrupt, repressive, child-killing regime, you represent a great culture and civilisation, and in a free Iran of tomorrow you will prove to the world what a great nation we are.""
Pahlavi's daughter, Noor Pahlavi, addressed a crowd in Los Angeles. The BBC's US partner CBS News reported her as saying Iranians had ""never been this close to freeing up themselves from this Islamic regime"".
She called on US President Donald Trump to end ongoing nuclear talks with Iran's leadership, describing it as ""negotiation with murderers"".
On Friday, Trump told reporters a change in Iran's government would be the ""best thing that could happen"", though it was unclear whether his comments were in reference to Pahlavi, who is seeking a role in Iran.
Trump told news agency Reuters last month that Pahlavi seemed ""very nice"" but expressed uncertainty over whether he could muster enough support within Iran to eventually lead it.
In Toronto, where an estimated 350,000 joined a demonstration, participants told BBC Persian they were there to speak out on behalf of friends and family inside Iran.
Street protests broke out in Iran on 28 December, initially sparked by economic turmoil and fuelled by long-running discontent with the country's leaders.
Demonstrations spread to more than 100 cities and towns across all of Iran's provinces.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has confirmed the deaths of 6,872 protesters, including more than 150 children.
Iranian authorities have acknowledged that at least 3,000 people were killed, but have claimed some were members of the country's security forces.
Many demonstrators in Iran have chanted Pahlavi's name and called for his return to political leadership.
Groomed from birth to inherit the throne, Pahlavi was 18 years old when the 1979 Islamic revolution swept away his father's monarchy.
Almost 50 years later, Pahlavi is once again seeking to shape his country's future.
But critics question whether his vision for Iran would ultimately lead to a democracy.

'We are not protected' says Hebron mayor as Israel expands West Bank control,2026-02-13T22:12:03.132Z," Lucy Williamson
Middle East correspondent
Hebron
","A Palestinian official in the occupied West Bank has described Israel's latest expansion of control there as ""the end of the road"" for negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.
Asma al-Sharabati, acting mayor of Hebron, said new legal changes recently announced by Israeli cabinet ministers would leave Palestinian authorities shut out of decisions on urban planning and development, even in areas under Palestinian control.
Hebron is a regular flashpoint in the West Bank - a divided city, where soldiers guard hundreds of Israeli settlers living alongside Palestinians in an Israeli military garrison.

On Sunday, the Israeli security cabinet passed major changes to the established division of powers in the West Bank, set up three decades ago under the US-backed Oslo Accords, signed by both Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
They include expanding Israeli control beyond its military occupation, into the provision of municipal services in Palestinian-run areas, as well as broad powers to take over so-called ""heritage sites"" across the West Bank – to protect water, environmental and archaeological resources, they say.
Israel also says it will take over planning authority at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, one of the holiest sites in Judaism, which sits inside the city's Ibrahimi Mosque.
""Now they can simply put their hands on any building and declare it is ancient, and the Palestinian authorities are not part of any decision on urban planning or development of the area,"" said al-Sharabati.
She told us she had not received any formal notification of Israel's plans, and was picking up the details from Israeli news.
A few metres from Hebron's bustling vegetable market, through the grey steel gates of the Israeli checkpoint, is a tense and deserted landscape, where Palestinian shops are shuttered, and streets closed off to protect Israeli settlers.
Issa Amro, a Palestinian activist, lives inside that volatile divided area, known as H2. The long and winding route to his house takes us through the back gardens of Palestinian homes, and along stony pathways, to a hill overlooking the neighbourhood.
When we arrive, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish couple are picnicking under the trees outside. A local settler appears from a neighbouring house and follows us a little way down the path.
Inside Issa's house, a plaque reads ""Free Palestine"". Through his window, a vast Israeli flag can be seen fluttering over the streets below.
He points out the Palestinian buildings nearby, emptied of residents after years of tension and expanding Israeli control.
But Issa says these new changes are different.
""They were expanding a lot without any legal basis,"" he said. ""Now they [will be] the law. They are changing the status from Occupied Territories to a legal dispute. It's part of Israel now without any rights for me. It's annexation of the land without me, as a Palestinian.""
Israel plans to start providing municipal services to Jewish settlers in Hebron, and open up land ownership across the West Bank to private Israeli citizens. Palestinians are banned from selling property to non-Palestinians under both Jordanian and Palestinian law.
Some of those who sold covertly to Israelis in the past now face real risks from Israel's planned publication of classified land registry there.
The social taboo of selling to the Israeli occupier runs deep.
Jibril Moragh lives next to Hebron's Ibrahimi Mosque. He told me that he had refused an offer from a group of Israelis to buy his house 18 years ago.
""One of them offered me 25 million shekels [$8m], but I refused,"" Jibril told me. ""The man said he would pay whatever I wanted, and that I could keep living here for as long as I liked. But you don't sell to the occupation [Israel].""
More than 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank and Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War. Those lands are wanted by Palestinians for their hoped-for independent state along with the Gaza Strip.
The settlements are illegal under international law.
The opening up of property rights, and the sweeping transfer of civilian powers in Palestinian-run areas, marks a significant shift in Israel's long expansion of control over the West Bank, which has escalated after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, and the war in Gaza.
""We are deepening our roots in all parts of the land of Israel,"" said Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who has responsibility for settlement policies, when he announced the new measures. ""And burying the idea of a Palestinian state.""
""Judea and Samaria is the Jewish homeland of the people of Israel,"" said Zvi Sukkot, a lawmaker in Smotrich's far-right Religious Zionism party. ""I expect there to be full Israeli sovereignty here, but in the meantime at least we can supervise, so there will be no environmental harm, and we won't harm the heritage of the people of Israel, even if it's in Palestinian-run areas.""
But these latest legal changes not only demolish the agreements Israel signed decades ago, they also drive a hole through the remaining powers of the Palestinian Authority, which has been earmarked in Donald Trump's peace plan to eventually take over power from Hamas.
""We are living the ugly truth that we are not protected,"" said Hebron mayor, al-Sharabati. ""Institutions are not protecting us. And the world is seeing the Gaza Strip and the massacres, and talking about them, but no more than that.""
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for a ""firm response"" from the US government, saying Israel's decision disrupts Donald Trump's efforts in the region and violates international law.
So far, President Trump has said little beyond reiterating his opposition to Israel's formal annexation of the West Bank.
Several countries, including the UK, last year recognised a Palestinian State. Now that Israel has given itself civilian powers in Palestinian-controlled territory, we asked the UK government what it would do in response.
Hamish Falconer, the Under-Secretary of State for the Middle East, told us that people could expect to hear more from the UK government in the coming days.
""We strongly condemn the decision and expect to see it reversed,"" he said. ""Almost all of Israel's friends are saying this is a terrible, terrible mistake.""
The expansion of Israeli presence and control across the West Bank has continued while international focus remains on Gaza.
But Trump's plan for Gaza depends on the support of Arab countries, many of whom are demanding progress towards a Palestinian state.
What happens in Hebron – and the rest of the West Bank - could still threaten Trump's vision for Gaza, and his plan for wider Middle East peace.

"Iran fortifies underground complex near nuclear site, satellite images show",2026-02-12T21:27:28.587Z," Emma Pengelly
BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad
BBC Persian
","Iran has been fortifying an underground complex near one of its nuclear facilities, according to analysis of new satellite images.
This activity comes at a time of heightened tensions as talks between Iranian and US officials continue, with President Donald Trump threatening fresh military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal on its nuclear programme.
The photos, first analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based think tank, show tunnel entrances being strengthened at Mount Kolang Gaz La - also known as Pickaxe Mountain.
Experts say this facility may be designed to protect Iran's uranium enrichment activities or key equipment, but its exact purpose - and whether it is operational - remains unclear.
Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
However, Trump said Iran was as little as a month away from having a nuclear weapon in June 2025, when he ordered strikes on three underground nuclear sites where centrifuges were being used to produce highly enriched uranium during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year.
Trump said the strikes had ""obliterated"" Iran's enrichment capacity, but that Iranian officials ""were thinking about starting a new site"".
Pickaxe Mountain was not one of the locations attacked in US and Israeli air strikes in June 2025, but the Natanz nuclear facility, located about 2km (1.24 miles) north, was hit.
A satellite image from 10 February shows what appears to be fresh concrete laid on top of one of the Pickaxe Mountain entrance areas.
A boom pump used to deliver concrete can be seen at the location, analysts from both ISIS and UK-based intelligence analysis firm Maiar agreed.
At another tunnel entrance, rock and soil has been pushed back and flattened. There's also a new concrete-reinforced structure nearby.
Experts at ISIS suggest these changes are intended to strengthen the tunnel entrances and give additional protection against a potential air strike.
ISIS says the ongoing presence of heavy construction machinery and material indicates the facility is not likely to be ready for operations yet.
""In the past, Iran has tied the construction to rebuilding an advanced centrifuge assembly plant, but the size of the facility, as well as the protection provided by the tall mountain, raised immediate concern whether additional sensitive activities are planned, such as uranium enrichment,"" they said.
Satellite images also show repair work and defensive strengthening has been taking place at the nearby Natanz nuclear site and at the Isfahan nuclear complex, 125km (77 miles) to the north, in recent weeks.
At Isfahan, all entrances to its tunnel complex now appear to be sealed off with earth, satellite images reviewed by ISIS reveal.
Backfilling the tunnel entrances like this would ""help dampen"" any air strike, ISIS says, as well as help to defend against a land-based assault to seize or destroy any highly enriched uranium that may be housed inside.
Also at Isfahan nuclear site, a new roof has been constructed. The building, attacked in an Israeli strike last year, is thought have been used in the manufacture of centrifuges.
Above-ground work is also visible at Natanz nuclear facility at a location damaged in air strikes by both Israel and the US last June. Between early December and January a roof has been built over a damaged anti-drone cage at an enrichment plant.
ISIS has assessed the roof was added to block the view of anyone trying to observe what Iran was doing beneath it.
Prof Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University in the US, says Iran is ""operating under the assumption that the attacks are going to happen and they need to protect the facilities as much as they can"".
""[The] Iranian nuclear programme hasn't been destroyed,"" he added. ""Clearly once you have the knowledge and capacity and technology to reconstruct the programme, you can always rebuild everything.""
Rafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC a new nuclear deal between Iran and the US was possible and was urgently needed.
""My sense, talking to all those involved, is that we have a window of opportunity, but windows of opportunity have a tendency to shut themselves quite abruptly and brusquely, so I think the we need to seize the moment,"" he said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference.
He also said he believed Iran's estimated 400kg of highly enriched uranium - which is a short, technical step away from weapons grade - remained in the underground tunnels and chambers where the US dropped bunker-busting bombs last June.

"Lyse Doucet: In Tehran, rallies for Iran's revolution overshadowed by discontent and defiance",2026-02-11T17:21:31.633Z," Lyse Doucet
Chief international correspondent
Tehran
","When clocks struck nine across Tehran on Tuesday, the night skies filled with sound in celebration of the 47th year of the Iranian revolution.
We listened from our hotel balcony as chants of ""God is greatest"" rose from rooftops and roared from windows. Fireworks flared in a kaleidoscope of brilliant colours.
But this year, in this annual explosion of light and sound, there was a discordant note.
We heard ""death to the dictator"" shouted too from somewhere in the darkness of the city, from the safety of spaces indoors.
It was a dramatic echo of the extraordinary wave of protests, which swept some streets and squares of Tehran, and towns and cities across this country last month. They were met with unprecedented lethal force and a huge loss of life unseen in previous uprisings.
It's our first trip to Iran since the protests, as the authorities slowly lift their near total internet blackout, described as one of the longest digital shutdowns in history, and gradually allow a small number of international media to return.
The mood in the capital is in stark contrast to our visit last June, at the end of the 12-day war with Israel, which also drew in America's attacks on Iran's nuclear sites.
That deadly conflagration had left many residents, including those who fled Tehran for safer cities, shaken by the blistering attacks and cemented their attachment to their country.
Now, this sprawling metropolis set against the stunning, snowy Mount Damavand is decked out in flags and bunting to mark what's known as the ""ten days of dawn"".
In 1979, this period ushered in an historic revolution that ousted the shah, totally transformed Iran, and created a radical ""axis of resistance"" among its allies across the region which has long been condemned and confronted by its enemies.
This year, the days are overshadowed by discontent and defiance over everything from the soaring prices of everyday goods hitting people's pockets, to calls which sounded on streets last month for an end to clerical rule.
These internal pressures, compounded by US President Donald Trump's warning of more military strikes if diplomacy fails, now pose an unparalleled challenge to Iran's ageing theocracy.
On Wednesday, on the last day of these anniversary events, the streets of the capital and other major cities were flooded with the government's most loyal foot soldiers - a political reply to the protests.
There was a festival air on this public holiday as families marched and meandered in a warm winter's sun.
Children and adults waved Iranian flags and photographs of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, chanting their signature slogans of ""death to America"" and ""death to Israel"".
""To me and to all Iranians, the revolution means a revival of life; new life was blown into our society and country, and I believe even to the Islamic world, and the whole world,"" exclaimed a beaming young woman who, like many women participating in this rally, was clothed in a long black veil.
When I asked her about the protests, she replied: ""There were people protesting who were dissatisfied with the economic situation, and their protest was legitimate."" But, she added: ""It is clear that those who rioted, and brought about chaos, had intentions which originated from beyond our borders.""
Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, speaking from a raised stage in Tehran's iconic Azadi (Freedom) Square before a massive crowd seething with emotion, reflected that view too.
He blamed ""malicious propaganda"" perpetuated by Iran's enemies - usually code words for America and Israel - for inflaming the unrest he referred to as riots.
But this senior official regarded as a reformist, who has tried to strike a conciliatory note since the start of the protests, also apologised for the government's shortcomings. ""We are ready to listen to the voice of the people,"" he emphasised.
He said they were making ""every possible effort"" to fix the problems - for him, that's a reference to the currency collapse and cost of living crisis that sparked a shopkeepers' strike on 28 December which spiralled into something much bigger.
In Iran's clerical system, real authority lies higher up with the 86-year-old supreme leader. He and the head of the judiciary have vowed there will be no leniency for people branded as terrorists and troublemakers.
The day before, on our first day in Tehran, we stopped by Enghelab (Revolution) Square on a drizzly grey day to try to get a sense of the mood in this city.
Soaring murals, brightly painted, of smiling crowds dominate building facades around this busy roundabout.
But a dark pall seemed to hang over this space.
Some Iranians, hurrying about their day, demurred from speaking. One woman told us it was too ""dangerous"" to talk to a journalist at this time.
But many more, when asked a very open question, ""what's the main worry on your mind?"", paused only briefly before pouring out their anger and pain.
Emotion was still raw, palpable, after all that's happened here.
Raha immediately burst into tears. ""It has been a month now since I haven't eaten or slept properly. Look at me, I am young, only 32, why should I be so ravished and depressed?"" she cried.
""I swear to God they keep saying that it was rioters. But people were not armed. What was their sin?"" she demanded.
Bespectacled, 20-year old Dori, who like some women no longer wears the mandatory headscarf, reflected how ""last month was terrible"".
""After the internet connections were restored, we saw a lot of horrible videos and photos of people under attack; they made us cry,"" she explained.
For 62-year-old Akhtar in a rose-pink headscarf, who spoke with fierce emphasis, there were two worries. ""So many young people were killed,"" she lamented first. Then she expressed the agony we hear from so many Iranians over the growing hardship in their day-to-day lives.
""The price of cooking oil has quadrupled; meat and chicken are the same. And unemployment is so high,"" she exclaimed.
Many of the people we spoke to, when asked about their message to the leaders now, replied like 20-year-old Amir. ""I think they should hear our voices.""
His 19-year-old friend Amir, standing beside him, was visibly upset. ""I just want our basic needs and freedoms.""
But even relieving the economic distress, magnified by water and electricity shortages, is entangled in decades of crippling international sanctions, suspicion over Iran's nuclear ambitions, as well as chronic corruption and mismanagement.
The Islamic Republic of Iran now stands at a crossroads, confronting its most consequential tests since its own uprising almost half a century ago.
The BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet is reporting from Tehran on condition that none of her material is used on the BBC's Persian Service. These restrictions apply to all international media organisations operating in Iran.

William meets female footballers on Saudi Arabia visit,2026-02-10T12:32:25.067Z," Maia Davies
","The Prince of Wales has met young female footballers in Riyadh during his visit to Saudi Arabia.
Prince William joined local youth squad players at a training session and heard about female participation in sport in the Gulf state.
The prince met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after landing in the country on Monday, where he is spending three days at the UK government's request as it seeks to improve ties with the country's de-facto leader.
He gave the crown prince an England football shirt worn by captain Harry Kane, Kensington Palace said, and the pair held a ""warm, far-ranging conversation which touched on many elements of [the] UK-Saudi bilateral relationship"".
The trip is set to focus on energy transition and young people - key areas of development in a country undergoing significant change - and presents diplomatic sensitivities given Saudi Arabia's human rights record.
Prince William, who is patron of the English Football Association, visited Misk Sports City in the capital on Tuesday to meet the young players.
Women were not allowed to attend sports events in stadiums in the country until 2018, and physical education was not introduced for girls until 2017.
The visit comes during a challenging period for the Royal Family following fresh allegations against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in relation to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing.
A reporter twice asked Prince William from the sidelines of the football pitch in Riyadh: ""Sir, to what extent do you think the Royal Family have done enough around the Andrew-Epstein issue?""
It is unclear if the prince heard the question from some distance away, and he did not respond.
The prince and Catherine, Princess of Wales made their first public statement on the scandal on Monday, saying they were ""deeply concerned"" by the latest revelations and ""focused on the victims"".
King Charles and Queen Camilla have also been asked about Andrew during recent engagements.
Also on Tuesday, Prince William attended an E-Sports tournament in the city and separately toured a section of the 84-mile (135km) Sports Boulevard, a network of sports facilities, green space, cycling and walking paths nominated for his environmental Earthshot Prize.
The prince spoke to local residents who make use of the urban regeneration project, including Reem Alrowaili and her seven-year-old daughter, Eliana Mufti.
Alrowaili, 43, said they had spoken about ""women's empowerment"": ""I lived the old days where we were not allowed to do anything, and now I'm really happy for my daughter because she will experience the good life, the better life.""
Prince William also met a delegation including the mayor of Riyadh at the boulevard, which is aiming to become the world's largest linear park upon completion.
The prince was briefed on MBS's reputation and the country's human rights record - where dissent is punished, women face enormous limitations, and same-sex marriage is criminalised - ahead of the trip.
A US intelligence report found the crown prince had approved the murder of exiled Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Saudi Arabia rejected the report, calling it ""negative, false and unacceptable"", while MBS denied any role in the murder.
The regime remains authoritarian and led by an absolute monarchy. But culturally, society has been opening up and the country is trying to develop its economy beyond a reliance on oil.
A royal source previously told the BBC that Prince William ""didn't flinch"" at the request to undertake the trip: ""He takes his role as Prince of Wales very seriously, so when the government asks, he goes.""

Palestinians say new Israeli measures in West Bank amount to de facto annexation,2026-02-10T10:04:30.544Z," Yolande Knell
Middle East correspondent
Jerusalem
","Palestinians, Arab countries, Israeli anti-occupation groups and the UK have condemned new steps approved by Israel's security cabinet for the occupied West Bank, saying they amount to de facto annexation.
Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced the moves that would make it easier for Jewish settlers to take over Palestinian land. ""We will continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state,"" he said.
All settlements are seen as illegal under international law.
The measures - which are expected to be signed off by Israel's top military commander for the West Bank - aim to increase Israeli control over the territory in terms of property law, planning, licensing and enforcement.
They were announced three days ahead of a meeting between the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and US President Donald Trump in Washington.
Last year, settlements in the West Bank expanded at their fastest rate since monitoring began, the United Nations (UN) has said.
The new Israeli measures include cancelling a decades-old prohibition on the direct sale of West Bank land to Jews and declassifying local land registry records. Up to now, settlers could only buy homes from registered companies on land controlled by Israel's government.
Israeli ministers presented the change as ""a step that will increase transparency and facilitate land redemption"". Israel's foreign ministry later said it corrected a ""racist distortion"" that ""discriminated against Jews, Americans, Europeans, and anyone who is not Arab regarding real estate purchases in Judea and Samaria"".
The cabinet also decided to repeal a legal requirement for a transaction permit to complete any purchase of real estate, thereby reducing oversight meant to prevent fraud.
Palestinians said they feared the changes would lead to more pressure on individuals to sell, as well as acts of forgery and deceit.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - who heads the Palestinian Authority (PA), governing parts of the West Bank - called the measures ""dangerous"" and an ""open Israeli attempt to legalise settlement expansion, land confiscation and the demolition of Palestinian properties, even in areas under Palestinian sovereignty"".
He called for the US and UN Security Council to intervene immediately.
The Israeli NGO Peace Now said the cabinet's decision risked toppling the PA and involved cancelling agreements and imposing de facto annexation. It accused the Israeli government of ""breaking every possible barrier on the path to massive land theft in the West Bank"".
The UK said it ""strongly condemned"" the move and called on Israel to reverse the decision, saying ""any unilateral attempt to alter the geographic or demographic make-up of Palestine is wholly unacceptable and would be inconsistent with international law"".
The foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar described the announcement as ""accelerating attempts at its illegal annexation and the displacement of the Palestinian people"".
Their statement ""warned against the continued expansionist Israeli policies and illegal measures pursued by the Israeli government in the occupied West Bank, which fuel violence and conflict in the region"".
With rights to the land at the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, land sales to settlers are a murky business often involving middlemen. They are considered as treason by the PA and are therefore technically punishable by death, although convicted individuals are typically given jail terms.
Other controversial steps announced by Smotrich, who has ministerial responsibility for settlement policies, and the Defence Minister, Israel Katz, include transferring building licensing at an important religious site and sensitive areas nearby in the volatile city of Hebron solely to Israeli authorities.
The Cave of the Patriarchs - also known as the Ibrahimi Mosque - is revered by Jews, Muslims and Christians as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob's burial place. It is the second holiest site in Judaism and the fourth in Islam.
Israeli bodies would also be given oversight and enforcement powers for environmental and archaeological matters in PA-administered areas.
As well, a committee would be revived to allow the State of Israel to make ""proactive"" land purchases in the West Bank billed as ""a step designed to secure land reserves for settlement for generations to come"".
In the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords, a breakthrough peace agreement, the newly created PA was given full control over Palestinian urban areas - about 20% of the territory - known as Area A.
In Area B, a similar percentage, the PA had only administrative control, while Israel kept its hold on security.
Israel retained full security and administrative control of 60% of the West Bank, where settlements are located, known as Area C.
More than 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank and Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War. Those lands are wanted by Palestinians for their hoped-for independent state along with the Gaza Strip.
The Trump administration has ruled out Israeli annexation of the West Bank but has not sought to check Israel's accelerated settlement construction.
Responding to the latest move, a White House official reiterated the US' opposition to annexation, saying: ""A stable West Bank keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration's goal to achieve peace in the region"".
Smotrich, a settler who heads a pro-settler party, has vowed to double the settler population in the West Bank.
In December, Israel's cabinet approved a proposal for 19 new settlements. Israel is also preparing to start construction of a contentious settlement project near Jerusalem, known as E1, which would effectively sever the northern and southern West Bank.
According to the UN, a record number of more than 37,000 Palestinians were displaced in 2025 alone - a year that it says also saw record-high levels of Israeli settler violence.
Netanyahu's governing coalition includes many pro-settler members who want Israel to annex the West Bank, to which they claim religious and historic ties.
The prime minister, who faces an election later this year, has declared he would never countenance the creation of a Palestinian state, which he said would be a security threat for his country.
In 2024, the International Court of Justice - the UN's highest court - issued a non-binding advisory opinion that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories was illegal and should end.

"Iran arrests reformists as crackdown on dissent widens, reports say",2026-02-09T18:26:28.992Z," Sebastian Usher
Middle East analyst
","The head of Iran's main reformist coalition, Azar Mansouri, is among at least five prominent opposition figures reported to have been arrested in recent days.
The move represents a widening of the regime's crackdown on dissent in response to the mass anti-government protests in January.
Iranian human rights groups have said they have confirmed the killing of more than 6,000 protesters when security forces brutally put down the demonstrations - and they have suggested that the final figure could be much higher.
Mansouri had called for the truth of what happened not to be covered up.
In a statement last week, she said: ""We will not allow the blood of these dear ones to be consigned to oblivion or the truth to be lost in the dust.""
The other reformists who are reported to have been arrested include Hossein Karroubi. He is the son of Mehdi Karroubi, who stood as a reformist presidential candidate in a disputed election in 2009 that sparked mass protests and was subsequently held under house arrest for many years.
The spokesman for the reformist coalition, Javad Emam, is also reported to have been detained, along with two other members, Ebrahim Asgharzadeh and Mohsen Aminzadeh.
The prosecutors' office in Tehran has accused those arrested of ""targeting national unity"" and acting in league with the US and Israel.
The campaign is a blow to President Masoud Pezeshkian, whose election in 2024 owed much to reformist support.
He had expressed a more conciliatory view of the protesters, but appears to have been largely sidelined.
Pezeshkian has also called for an inquiry into the protests, but the weakness of both his personal position and that of the presidency itself within the Iranian theocratic system appears to have been exposed once again.
The crackdown on the prominent reformists sends a signal that more moderate voices are being further silenced, just days after Iranian and US officials held talks on trying to reach a deal on Iran's nuclear programme.
Both sides have described the initial discussions in Oman as positive, although no concrete progress appears to have been made so far.
In another indication that hardliners in Iran are still calling the shots, the semi-official Tasnim news agency says that Ali Larijani - a close adviser to the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council - is to head to Oman for talks with Omani mediators on Tuesday.
Negotiations with the Trump administration are said to be focusing on Iran's nuclear programme.
That's led protesters inside Iran and their supporters outside to bemoan an apparent change of approach by the US from its initial stance of vowing a decisive response if the regime killed people participating in the demonstrations.
The huge build-up of US military forces in the region remains in place, with its threat of an all-out attack on Iran.
The Iranian regime is hoping to avert this through negotiations and possible concessions.
But this latest move against what's left of the opposition is likely to make building any sense of trust with Washington more elusive.

"Fifteen killed in latest Lebanon building collapse, as warnings of neglect grow",2026-02-09T13:12:44.720Z," Samantha Granville
Beirut
","The death toll from the collapse of two residential buildings in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli has risen to 15, state media say.
Eight people were rescued alive, Civil Defence director general Imad Khreiss said.
Khreiss said the two adjoining buildings were home to 22 residents, but local municipal authorities warned people could still be missing.
Social media footage captured the moment the buildings collapsed, with one side giving way at the lower floors before both structures fell almost simultaneously.
The latest disaster is the fifth residential building collapse in Tripoli this winter, highlighting growing concerns over old and undermaintained buildings in Lebanon's poorest city.
The footage shows a thick cloud of dust and debris engulfing the street as the buildings folded in on one another.
After the collapse, large crowds gathered around the site of a crater where the buildings had stood.
Tripoli's mayor, Abdel Hamid Karimeh, said the city had suffered long-term dereliction.
""Thousands of our people in Tripoli are threatened due to years of neglect,"" he said. ""The situation is beyond the capabilities of the Tripoli municipality.""
He later announced he had submitted his resignation to the interior minister, describing Tripoli as ""disaster-stricken.""
President Joseph Aoun said he was ""monitoring developments"" and called on rescue workers across the country to mobilise.
Prime Minister Nawaf Salam described the buildings collapse as a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and said the government was ready to help.
""The government is fully prepared to provide accommodation for all residents of buildings that need to be evacuated,"" he said, adding that the disaster was the ""results of years of accumulated neglect"".
The collapse comes days after residents were evacuated from a nearby building following structural cracking, and two weeks after another deadly collapse, where a father and daughter were killed.
Tripoli is Lebanon's second-largest city and has seen repeated building failures amid years of economic crisis, lack of maintenance, and weak regulation.
Last month, the head of the Higher Relief Authority said more than 100 buildings in the city required evacuation warnings.
Many residential blocks across Lebanon were built illegally or without permits, especially during the 1975-1990 civil war, while others have been expanded with additional floors without proper oversight, authorities say, leaving thousands at risk, especially during the cold and wet winter months.
In a statement, the national syndicate for property owners said the collapse was the result of ""blatant negligence and shortcomings of the Lebanese state toward the safety of citizens and their housing security,"" and urged the government to carry out a nationwide assessment of buildings at risk of collapse.

","BBC News Persian has verified the identities of more than 200 of the thousands of people killed during Iran's brutal crackdown on the recent widespread protests.
The project has scoured social media, verified online footage and used eyewitness accounts to build up a chronicle of how and when the protesters were killed, as well as some details about their lives.
Many of these accounts were provided to the BBC by sources close to the victims and were cross-checked against data from human rights organisations.
Since the unrest began in late December, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has confirmed the deaths of 6,872 protesters, including more than 150 children.
Iranian authorities acknowledge that at least 3,000 people were killed, but claim some were members of the security forces.
Pictures of and information about victims identified by BBC News Persian can be seen in this page on the BBC News Persian site (text in Persian).
Among those killed were Mansoureh Heydari and her husband, Behrouz Mansouri. A family friend told BBC News Persian that the couple had joined the protests in Bushehr, in south-west Iran, when both were shot dead by security forces on 8 January.
The security forces had opened fire on protesters gathered outside a mosque, they said. Behrouz was struck in the head and fatally wounded. Mansoureh, who had initially been running away, returned to her husband but was later shot as well.
The couple died side by side in the street, leaving behind two children aged eight and 10. Their bodies were returned by security forces four days later and they were buried next to each other.
A close relative said the family were ""proud"" that the couple had ""died for their homeland"" but added that they now live in fear under intense security pressure.
Many of the faces featured in the project are young men and women, mostly in their late teens to early 30s.
One 17-year-old art student, Ghazal Damarcheli, was shot outside her family home in the city of Karaj, west of Tehran, on 9 January.
A source close to the family told BBC News Persian that even after her death, the family faced pressure, as security forces refused to allow them to bury her nearby. Her remains were instead interred in a remote cemetery, far from the family home.
That same night, 28-year-old biotechnology student Negin Ghadimi was also killed.
Despite her father's pleas for her to stay at home, she joined protesters on the streets of Tonekabon, about 200km (125 miles) north of Tehran.
Security forces opened fire on the crowd, and she was hit in the side, a source close to the family said. She fell into her father's arms and told him as she lay dying: ""Dad, I'm burning.""
The findings for this project were produced through multiple steps and interviews with sources inside Iran, many of whose names cannot be disclosed for safety reasons.
After examining social media accounts and online activity to establish each person's identity and involvement in the protests, the BBC team cross-checked the circumstances around their deaths against open-source data from inside Iran.
Analysing footage of funerals and images of memorials provided key details, such as timing, location and circumstances of death.
Individuals were also identified in footage from morgues, including the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre, to where many bodies from Tehran and surrounding areas were transferred.
The work became especially difficult at the height of the protests on 8 January, when Iran's government cut off internet, mobile phone and landline access for nearly three weeks.
But by piecing together information from inside the country via Starlink, the satellite network owned by Elon Musk, and relying on eyewitness accounts from Iranians who travelled to the borders to pick up neighbouring signals, BBC News Persian was able to start verifying the reports of protesters' deaths.
The BBC Visual Journalism team has created an interactive ""face wall"" for the BBC News Persian website, where readers can explore the profiles of victims identified through the research by clicking on each photograph.
The project is ongoing, and the team aims to add further names and stories as verification continues.

The human rights activist was sentenced to six years for ""gathering and collusion"", and one-and-a-half years for ""propaganda activities"" by a court in the north-eastern city of Mashhad, Mostafa Nili announced on social media on Sunday.
Mohammadi was arrested in December for making ""provocative remarks"" at a memorial ceremony, Iranian authorities said at the time. Her family said she was taken to hospital after being beaten during the arrest.
The 53-year-old was made a Nobel laureate in 2023 for activism against the oppression of women in Iran.
Nili, who spoke to Mohammadi for the first time since 14 December, said she had also been handed a two-year ban on leaving the country and two years of exile to the eastern Khusf region.
The Narges Foundation, which supports her, described the hearing on Saturday as a ""sham"" and explained she had begun a hunger strike on 2 February.
Nili said she had been taken to hospital three days ago ""due to her poor physical condition"" before being returned to the detention centre she is being held in.
""When she began to explain the events and how she was detained, the phone was disconnected.""
Mohammadi's husband, Taghi Rahmani, said she offered no defence while in court due to her ""steadfast"" belief that ""this judiciary holds no legitimacy"" and that the proceedings were ""a mere charade with a pre-determined end"".
""Though she was likely forced to attend, she remained silent - she did not utter a single word, nor did she sign a single paper.""
He described the sentence to the BBC as ""cruel and very unfair"", and called on human rights organisations to protest against the ruling.
Meanwhile, Kiana Rahmani, Mohammadi's daughter, said she was ""gravely concerned"" for her mother.
Mohammadi has already spent more than 10 years of her life in prison. The Narges Foundation says the latest sentence brings the total time she has been ordered to spend in prison to 44 years.
Since 2021, she has been serving a 13-year sentence for ""propaganda activity against the state"" and ""collusion against state security"", charges she denies.
The activist was given temporary release from Tehran's notorious Evin prison for three weeks in December 2024 on medical grounds.
She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences.
The most recent arrest came as she attended a memorial for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer who had been found dead in his office in early December.
Norway-based group Iran Human Rights has called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances surrounding his death were ""suspicious"".
The Narges Foundation previously said eyewitnesses had seen Mohammadi being attacked by around 15 plainclothes agents of the regime while at the memorial event, and that some were seen pulling her hair and beating her with clubs and batons.
Mashhad prosecutor Hasan Hematifar told reporters that Mohammadi had been among 39 people arrested, and she and Alikordi's brother had encouraged those present ""to chant norm-breaking slogans"" and ""disturb the peace"".
Mohammadi was among signatories of a petition that expressed criticism of the Iranian authorities and held Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responsible for what it called ""crimes against humanity"" over the killing of protesters during unrest that began in late December.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has counted more than 50,000 arrests related to the demonstrations and had confirmed at least 6,961 deaths.
The petition called for the prosecution of those acting on Khamenei's orders and an end to the Islamic Republic.
Four prominent Iranian activists - identified as Abdollah Momeni, Mehdi Mahmoudian, Vida Rabbani and Ghorban Behzadian-Nejad - have also been arrested since 31 January for their contribution to the petition.
Taghi Rahmani urged the release of ""all political prisoners in Iran"".

Israeli intelligence chief's brother charged with smuggling cigarettes into Gaza,2026-02-05T17:58:08.546Z," Joel Gunter
Jerusalem
","Israeli prosecutors have charged the brother of the head of the country's intelligence agency, Shin Bet, with ""aiding the enemy in wartime"" by allegedly smuggling cigarettes into Gaza.
An indictment against Bezalel Zini published on Thursday argues he was aware that Hamas might profit from the resale of cigarettes and tobacco at inflated prices.
Zini, 50, a reservist on active duty in the Israeli military, is said to have smuggled 14 cartons of cigarettes - 7,000 individual packets - in exchange for a total of 365,000 shekels ($117,000; £86,000).
His brother, the recently appointed Shin Bet chief David Zini, is not suspected of any wrongdoing.
Israel has tightly controlled the flow of humanitarian aid and other goods into Gaza during the conflict with Hamas.
The charges are part of a wider set of indictments against more than a dozen individuals, alleging that an organised crime ring smuggled brand new, top-end iPhones, car parts, and other electronics into Gaza.
The sale of smuggled tobacco and cigarettes alone put ""hundreds of millions of shekels into Hamas's coffers since the start of the war"", the indictment alleges.
Prosecutors say the smuggling operation began in the summer of 2025, before the ceasefire in October, when the fighting was still raging in the strip.
They say the smugglers pretended they were entering Gaza as part of their military duties, misleading Israeli soldiers on the border crossing points.
The indictment against Bezalel Zini also accuses him of fraud, receiving a bribe, and tax offences. He was arrested two weeks ago along with two alleged accomplices, who were also charged with smuggling.
Zini's defence lawyers said their client denied the charges, according to Israel's Haaretz newspaper, arguing that the application of a terrorism law was not appropriate for the alleged smuggling of cigarettes.
""Regarding the offence of aiding the enemy during wartime, it is a complete inversion of reality. This is someone who has given everything and risked his life for the state,"" the paper quoted one of his lawyers as saying.

Lebanon says Israel sprayed southern villages with concentrated herbicide,2026-02-05T16:42:12.767Z," Samantha Granville
Beirut
","Lebanon has accused Israeli aircraft of spraying an agricultural herbicide over southern villages at concentrations authorities described as dangerously high, raising concerns for food and environmental security.
The agriculture and environment ministries said laboratory tests confirmed the substance was glyphosate, a chemical used to destroy vegetation, with concentrations in some samples ""between 20 and 30 times the levels usually accepted"".
President Joseph Aoun condemned the spraying of what he described as ""toxic substances"", calling it a violation of Lebanese sovereignty and an environmental and health crime.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had no comment on the matter.
The purpose behind the release of herbicide on the villages remains unclear.
Residents in several border villages reported the spraying, which comes more than a year after a ceasefire ended a war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.
Earlier in the week, United Nations peacekeepers in Lebanon said they had been notified by Israel of planned spraying near the border and were advised to take shelter.
The communication forced them to cancel some of their planned operations. They said this was not the first time Israeli forces had dropped unknown chemical substances from aircraft over Lebanese territory.
With tens of thousands still displaced after hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in 2023-24, the challenges for returning home are compounded, according to Ramzi Kaiss, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in Lebanon.
""These areas are heavily dependent on agriculture - olive groves, tobacco, and other crops - and this incident complicates people's ability to return to their homes, maintain their livelihoods, and rebuild after extensive destruction,"" Kaiss said.
Experts warn that incidents like this do not only harm local ecosystems but also have broader economic consequences for Lebanon's farming sector.
In April 2025, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization reported that the 2024 conflict had caused more than $700m (£515m; 600m euros ) in damage and losses to Lebanon's agricultural sector, particularly in the south and the Bekaa Valley.
Environmental groups like Green Southerners in Lebanon also expressed concern about the impact on agricultural production and soil fertility.
""These actions threaten ecosystems already damaged by white phosphorus, with serious risks to insect communities and natural pollinators, undermining biodiversity, food security, and local livelihoods,"" the group said in an Instagram post.
But there's no universal consensus on the risks of glyphosate.
The World Health Organization's (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies it as ""probably carcinogenic to humans,"" citing a link to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while other regulatory bodies, including the US Environmental Protection Agency and European Food Safety Authority, have concluded it is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans.
The Lebanese foreign ministry said it intended to submit a formal complaint against Israel to the UN Security Council.

JerusalemandDavid Gritten
","At least 20 Palestinians, including several children and a paramedic, have been killed and almost 40 others wounded in Israeli strikes in Gaza, hospitals say.
The Israeli military said tanks and aircraft carried out ""precise strikes"" against what it called ""terrorists"" who opened fire on troops in the north of the strip, seriously wounding an officer.
It added that the attack happened close to the Yellow Line, beyond which Israeli forces are stationed in Gaza, and that it constituted a ""blatant violation"" of the three-month-old ceasefire deal with Hamas.
Hamas accused Israel of using the shooting as ""a flimsy pretext to justify the continuation of killing and aggression against our people"".
Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said it had received the bodies of 13 people, including five children, who were killed when tents for displaced families and homes in the eastern Zeitoun and Tuffah neighbourhoods were hit.
Among the mourners gathered in the hospital's courtyard for funeral prayers was Abu Mohammed Haboush, who said his family was asleep in their home when it was shelled.
""Our children were martyred - my son was martyred, my brother's son and daughter were martyred,"" he told Reuters news agency.
""We have nothing to do with anything, we are peaceful people.""
Nasser hospital in the city of Khan Younis said four dead, including one child, were brought there following strikes on tents in the southern Qizan Rashwan area.
Another two children, sisters Rahaf and Remas Abu Jamea, and paramedic Hussein al-Samiri were later killed in the coastal al-Mawasi area west of Khan Younis, hospital officials said.
A first responder from the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, Jihad al-Hinnawi, told Reuters that the paramedic had rushed to help victims of a strike on a tent in the coastal al-Mawasi area and was then killed by a second strike on the same location.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said separately that Samiri was killed ""while carrying out his humanitarian duty in Khan Younis"". It also accused the Israeli military of a ""grave violation"" of international humanitarian law, which protects medical personnel.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was ""appalled"" to learn of Samiri's killing and stressed that it was ""unacceptable that first responders in Gaza continue to face risk to their lives while carrying out humanitarian mission"".
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike in al-Mawasi targeted a platoon commander of the elite Nukhba forces of Hamas's military wing, whom it named as Bilal Abu Assi. It alleged that he had led the attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October 2023 and ""likely took part in holding deceased hostages captive throughout the war"".
""The IDF is aware of the claim that several uninvolved civilians, including a medical staff member, were hit in the strike. Prior to and during the strike, steps were taken in order to mitigate harm to civilians,"" it added.
Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October.
On Sunday, more than 30 people were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza. The IDF said its forces launched those strikes after gunmen emerged from a tunnel in the southern Rafah area, beyond the Yellow Line.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 556 people have been killed by Israeli fire, while the Israeli military has said four of its soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks.
The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.

Iran's president says it is ready to negotiate with the US,2026-02-03T17:05:06.329Z," Ottilie MitchellandDavid Gritten
","President Masoud Pezeshkian has said Iran is ready to negotiate with the US after requests from ""friendly governments in the region"" to respond to a proposal for talks.
In a statement on X, Pezeshkian said he had told Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to pursue talks ""provided that a suitable environment exists - one free from threats and unreasonable expectations"".
His words come after the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned any attack on Iran would spark a ""regional war"".
US President Donald Trump has built up forces in the region and threatened to take military action if Iran does not agree a deal on its nuclear programme and stop killing protesters.
Pezeshkian said Iran would pursue ""fair and equitable negotiations"" with the US, adding that they should be ""conducted within the framework of our national interests"".
The talks may be held in Istanbul on Friday, with Araghchi due to meet US special envoy Steve Witkoff, according to US media reports.
The foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have also been invited to participate.
Pezeshkian's announcement came a day after Araghchi told CNN in an interview that he was ""confident that we can achieve a deal"" to ""ensure that there is no nuclear weapons"".
Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
When asked about the prospect of a deal by reporters, Trump said: ""If we can work something out, that would be great, and if we can't, probably bad things would happen.""
He said a ""tremendous force"" was headed to Iran, including the ""biggest and the best"" ships.
The US military build-up in the region includes the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, which has an air wing of around 70 aircraft, and three destroyers equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles.
In an address on Sunday, Khamenei told Iranians: ""We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them.""
Last June, the US carried out air and missile strikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran.
Trump said the strikes ""obliterated"" Iran's capacity to produce enriched uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons.
The Israeli military also targeted Iran's nuclear facilities and nuclear scientists during the war, as well as its military commanders and missile arsenal.
Iran responded to the strikes by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. It also carried out a missile attack on a major US air base in Qatar.
Last week, the US president said he had told Iran it had to do ""two things"" to avoid fresh US military action.
""Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters. They're killing them by the thousands,"" he added.
His administration is reportedly demanding that Iran end all uranium enrichment, accept limits on its ballistic missile programme, and halt support for armed groups in the region.
Iran's supreme leader has previously refused to abandon its right to enrich uranium.
However, Reuters news agency cited an Iranian official as saying the ballistic missile programme was the biggest obstacle to a deal, and that their country was ""ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400kg of highly enriched uranium, accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution"".
On Tuesday, UAE presidential adviser Anwar Gargash said the Middle East had ""gone through various calamitous confrontations"" and did not need another one.
""I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don't have these issues every other day,"" he told the World Governments Summit in Dubai.
Qatar's foreign ministry also said its diplomacy with Iran was ""continuing very intensively"" in ""tandem with all our neighbours"".
Witkoff meanwhile flew to Israel on Tuesday for talks about Iran with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the head of the Mossad spy agency, Israeli officials said.
Last month, Trump's focus was on ending the brutal crackdown by Iranian security forces on the protests that swept across the Islamic Republic. He warned that those responsible would ""pay a big price"" and told protesters that ""help is on its way"".
The unrest was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living, but they quickly developed into demands for political change.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,424 protesters, 152 children, 214 people associated with the government, and 58 bystanders. It is also investigating reports of another 11,280 deaths.
Norway-based Iran Human Rights has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.
Iranian authorities have acknowledged that at least 3,117 people were killed, but said the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by ""rioters"".
Khamenei described the unrest as ""sedition"" orchestrated by the US and Israel.
Iranian officials told Reuters on Monday that Iran's leadership was worried that US military action could break its grip on power by driving people back onto the streets.
Khamenei had been briefed in high-level meetings that public anger following the protests had reached a point where fear was no longer a deterrent, they said.

Israel reopens Gaza's key Rafah border crossing with Egypt,2026-02-03T09:02:36.221Z," Yolande Knell
Middle East correspondent
JerusalemandHafsa Khalil
","Only a few sick and wounded Palestinians from Gaza arrived in Egypt on Monday after the Rafah border crossing reopened for the movement of people.
The crossing has largely been closed since the Gazan side was captured by Israeli forces in May 2024.
The reopening was supposed to happen during the first phase of US President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, which began in October. But Israel blocked it until the return of the body of the last Israeli hostage, which happened last week.
It will come as a relief to many Palestinians who see it as a lifeline to the world, although there is frustration that only small numbers of people and no goods will be allowed through.
Around 20,000 sick and wounded Palestinians are waiting to leave Gaza for treatment, according to local hospitals and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Israeli reports said only 50 patients - accompanied by one or two relatives - would be allowed to exit each day, and that 50 people who left Gaza during the war would be allowed to return.
However, only five patients and their seven companions crossed from Gaza on Monday.
Another 12 Palestinians were allowed to return to Gaza, while 38 did not clear security and had to spend the night on the Egyptian side of the crossing, Palestinian and Egyptian sources said.
Palestinian officials blamed the delays on Israeli security checks, but there was no immediate comment from Israel's military.
On Monday morning, an Israeli security official had said the Rafah crossing was open for ""the movement of residents, for both entry and exit"".
The crossing will be monitored by supervisors from the European Union Border Assistance Mission and local Palestinian staff, while Israel will carry out stringent security checks remotely.

A Palestinian mother, Sabrine al-Da'ma, told the BBC she was hoping to travel abroad with her 16-year-old daughter, Rawa, who suffers from kidney disease. She plans to donate Rawa one of her kidneys.
""She used to be treated through monitoring, ultrasound imaging and tests to check the condition of her kidneys. Since the war started, because of food shortages, hunger, and the food she was forced to eat, she began dialysis,"" Da'ma said.
""We hope they will speed up our referral so that we can travel quickly, because she is getting exhausted. I am also 45 years old, and they may tell me that as I get older, I won't be able to donate anymore. That's why we're rushing.""
Maha Ali, 26, told the BBC that she was hoping to leave Gaza to study a master's degree in Algeria, but that she had previously been told by Israeli authorities that they did not consider students to be ""humanitarian cases"".
""By now, I was supposed to have defended my master's thesis and started my PhD, but two years of my life have been lost. I am now in Gaza and I have not been able to do anything I had planned,"" she said.
The head of the Palestinian technocratic committee due to take over day-to-day running of Gaza, Ali Shaath, said the reopening of the crossing marked ""the beginning of a long process that will reconnect what has been severed and open a genuine window of hope for our people in the Gaza Strip"".
The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: ""The opening of the Rafah crossing marks a concrete and positive step in the peace plan.""
UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also welcomed the move, but stressed that ""much more still needs to be done"". ""Aid must flow in, restrictions on essential supplies must ease, and aid workers must be allowed to operate,"" she added.
On Sunday, Israeli authorities said a trial opening of the crossing was carried out and completed.
One Palestinian official familiar with the arrangements for the trial told the BBC that around 30 Palestinian staff members had arrived at the Egyptian side of the crossing, ahead of the initial operational phase.
The WHO will oversee the transfer of patients from territory under Hamas control, transporting them by bus to the crossing over the ""Yellow Line"" and into territory controlled by the Israeli military.
About 150 hospitals and 300 ambulances in Egypt are ready to receive the evacuated patients, according to Al Qahera News TV, which is close to Egyptian intelligence.
Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan says the reopening of the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under a previous ceasefire deal in January last year.
Before being seized by Israel in 2024, the crossing was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the war and a key entry point for humanitarian aid. Now, aid that enters from Egypt is routed via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing point.
In December, the Israeli government said the Rafah crossing would open to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza. But Egypt said the crossing would only be opened if movement was allowed in both directions.
More than 30,000 Gazans have registered with the Palestinian embassy in Cairo to be allowed to return to Gaza.
The crossing's opening was delayed due to the Israeli government making it conditional on Hamas handing over the body of the last dead Israeli hostage in Gaza.
Last week, the Israeli military said its troops had retrieved the remains of police officer Master Sgt Ran Gvili at a cemetery in northern Gaza.
He was one of the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies during their attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed around 1,200 people.
Israel's military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, has killed more than 71,800 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Both sides have accused each other of repeated violations since the ceasefire began 16 weeks ago. The health ministry has said 526 people have been killed by Israeli fire, while the Israeli military has said four of its soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks.

Syria's only female minister pushes for change: 'I'm not here for window dressing',2026-02-02T00:28:13.110Z," Lyse Doucet
chief international correspondentandLina Shaikhouni
BBC World Service
Syria
","""On the first day, I asked 'why are there no more women?',"" says Hind Kabawat.
She is Syria's minister for social affairs and labour - the only female minister in the transitional government tasked with navigating the country's jagged road from war to peace.
Sectarian violence, which has killed thousands of people, has marred its first months in power, with many of Syria's minority communities blaming government forces.
Once an opposition leader in exile, Kabawat acknowledges the government has made mistakes since President Ahmed al-Sharaa's rebel forces swept into the capital on 8 December 2024, ending decades of the Assad family's brutal dictatorship.
But she insists ""mistakes happen in transition"".
Kabawat also says one of the president's biggest mistakes has not been appointing other women in his cabinet, though she says he has assured her there will be more.
In his cabinet - which is dominated by his close comrades and some former fighters - she faces a challenging juggling act.
We followed Kabawat for our special report for the BBC's Global Women and saw up close how her array of dossiers cover Syria's most vulnerable, including orphans and widows, as well as the grieving families of the tens of thousands who disappeared during Assad's regime.
Another pressing priority is to create jobs and find homes for the millions displaced during nearly 14 years of civil war, and easing the suffering of those fleeing the latest clashes among communities.
Everything is urgent in a broken country - which is also broke. The United Nations says 90% of Syrians live below the poverty line.
In early January, Kabawat rushed to the northern city of Aleppo to visit shelters harbouring thousands of people after fighting flared between government forces and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who have long dominated north-eastern Syria.
Last summer, she tried to bring aid into a southern city populated mostly by Druze after it was torn by deadly violence between Druze, Bedouin and Syrian government forces.
And she reached out to the family of an Alawite woman, from the same minority Shia sect as the Assad family, who accused armed men in military fatigues of rape.
There are some complaints Kabawat could do more to help mend the fractures between Syria's different communities.
Asked if the government made mistakes in its response to the sectarian violence, she replies: ""Mistakes happen in transition, in post-conflict; no-one is happy about it, including the president.""
But she stresses an inquiry was set up, and now ""many of those who committed those crimes are in prison"".
Understanding how to build trust, and peace, has defined much of her working life. Educated at universities in Syria, Lebanon, Canada and the United States, Kabawat is a lawyer and negotiator who played a leading role in the exiled Syrian opposition during the civil war.
In her own arsenal, she sees her sharpest tool as dialogue.
""It's taking time for people to say 'we trust you' after 50 years of dictatorship,"" she explains, emphasising that trust is needed ""people to people"" as well as between government and the population.
We travel with her to the provincial capital of Idlib in the north-west, the former rebel stronghold of Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham forces.
She worked here during the civil war, with Tastakel, a women-led organisation she founded. Its name translates roughly from Arabic as ""becoming independent"" - which also sums up her philosophy on building this new Syria.
In a packed, brightly-lit hall, young and old women, and some men, from across Syria, are gathered to celebrate the end of the old order, and to strategise about strengthening the role of women at all levels of decision-making.
For Kabawat, it is about taking responsibility.
In recent indirect elections for the new transitional parliament, or People's Assembly, not a single woman was elected from Idlib. Overall, only 4% of seats went to female candidates.
""You should have been united and thought in a politically intelligent way to ensure we got one or two women elected,"" she scolds the women.
You could feel the energy coursing through the room of well-spoken women, some wearing tightly wrapped headscarves, others in head-to-toe veils, and some -including Kabawat - bare-headed.
This has always been the female face of Syria, a society often described as a mosaic of many traditions. Initial concerns that stricter Islamist rules would be imposed by Sharaa and his supporters, who adhere to a strict interpretation of Sunni Islam, have not materialised in the main, but worries still linger for some.
Sharaa himself, a former al-Qaeda commander-turned-Islamist rebel leader, has shucked his military fatigues for a tailored Western-style suit and now positions himself as a pragmatist.
Kabawat says that on that first day, when he announced his government in March last year, the president assured her more women would be appointed. ""He said: 'It's coming, we are in transition,'"" she adds.
Any suggestion she is a token woman in his ranks meets a firm rebuke.
""I am not here for window dressing,"" she declares. ""I don't feel that I am a Christian or a woman when I do my job. I feel like I am a citizen of Syria... The minute I start feeling like I'm a minority or I'm a woman, I will lose my legitimacy.""
At the conference in Idlib, there's a sudden sign of a changing society. Kabawat is ambushed by an enthusiastic crowd of young women talking excitedly over each other - former students from her Tastakel classes.
""We're implementing the mission she taught us and we are trying to acquire more expertise so we are ready,"" says one of them, Siwar.
Kabawat exclaims in approval as another, Ghufran, wags her finger for emphasis: ""We either occupy a space where we hold all the decision-making power, or we don't want to be in that space at all.""
Even in deeply conservative Idlib, women of an earlier generation played leadership roles in civil society during the war.
Softly-spoken and exuding confidence, Ahlam al-Rasheed is now the director of social affairs in the provincial government.
Nearly a decade ago, in 2017, she earned a place on the BBC's 100 Women list with her work promoting women's rights.
During the civil war, women ""led across several sectors, including in politics, relief, education and health"", she says. Many were - and still are - the main breadwinners in their families.
We travel to a bleak tented camp on barren land on the edge of the city, where we see the reality of what Rasheed says is the biggest challenge facing Syrian women now.
This camp, and countless others dotting the country, house millions of Syrians whose homes still lie in utter ruin.
Kabawat briefly greets the robed and suited men standing in line to receive her. Then she makes a beeline for a gaggle of giggling children and expectant women, most in flowing black cloaks. The jaunty wool cap pulled over her honey-brown hair may be her nod to both the cold winter weather and more conservative ways.
Inside a tented mosque, she sits on the floor listening to a litany of woes from women, many of them widows, living in grinding poverty and pain, without assistance.
Again, Kabawat throws it back to them, asking who would like to be taught to make handicrafts to be sold internationally. A sea of hands rise.
Then, she is on her way, leading a ""choo-choo train"" formed by a line of delighted children, sprinkling humour, happiness and even a little hope, but not the real aid they so desperately need.
Later I ask her what she said to the man who lamented that he had worked so hard in the opposition but was still living in a tent.
""Of course, they're right,"" she reflects. ""I feel their pain."" She highlights the urgent need for ""a united effort from the international community"".
I point out that donors say the government also has to move more quickly to establish a new legal system, as well as transparency.
""Of course, they're not right,"" she shoots back. ""We inherited a country which was completely destroyed and we're working on laws to renew and adapt a new country - so it's taking time.""
Her tone is even more emphatic when I ask about reports that Sharaa's inner circle is now creating a shadow government by taking away ministers' power to appoint their own deputies.
""I won't be here the minute I see that I can't appoint my own deputy and don't have the freedom to make my own strategy,"" she declares. ""Nobody controls me.""
Sharaa ""cannot rely on one side"", she adds. ""If he's not going to be inclusive and bring many people together in the government… we can't survive.""
Post-Assad Syria has received hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from many countries.
An American push - with President Donald Trump's personal backing - has helped lift crippling sanctions.
But the World Bank estimates that Syria will need at least $200bn (£145bn), just to rebuild its shattered landscape. And some donors are hesitating because of volatility in the country and wider region, exacerbated by Israel's repeated attacks on its neighbour.
Israel says it is acting against perceived threats posed by Syria's armed groups.
As we sit in Kabawat's graceful living room, among framed family photographs and sprays of Syria's new flag, her can-do composure breaks for a moment.
""I see the suffering of the people... and feel responsible for their pain,"" she admits, wiping a tear. She says when she feels she does not have the resources to help people, that is the one time she asks herself ""why did I do this?""
Then there's a rustle outside the door. Another delegation is waiting to see her.
""Khalas [enough], enough of tears,"" she vows. ""It's another day and it's back to work.""

"Iranian protester Erfan Soltani released on bail, reports say",2026-02-01T19:00:01.866Z," George Wright
","A 26-year-old Iranian man who was reportedly sentenced to death in connection with anti-government protests last month has been released on bail, reports say.
Erfan Soltani was arrested on 8 January in the city of Fardis, just west of Tehran, as protests swept across the country, prompting a deadly crackdown by Iranian authorities.
Officials then informed his family that he had been scheduled to be executed within days, without giving any additional details, according to Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw.
But Iran's judiciary denied that he was sentenced to death, saying he faced security-related charges carrying prison terms only.
Soltani's lawyer, Amir Mousakhani, told news agency AFP that he had been released on bail on Saturday ""and received all of his belongings including his cellphone"".
A bail of ""two billion tomans"" (around $12,600; £9,200) was paid for his release, the lawyer added.
Hengaw and Iranian media, including Isna, a semi-official Iranian news agency, also said Soltani had been bailed.
The arrest of Soltani, a clothes shop owner, made headlines around the world when it was reported that he was allegedly due to be executed.
At the time, one of Soltani's relatives told BBC Persian that a court had issued a death sentence ""in an extremely rapid process, within just two days"".
US President Donald Trump previously threatened to take ""very strong action"" if executions were carried out. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that any attack would spark a regional conflict.
In January, the Iranian government called reports by foreign media organisations that Soltani faced execution a ""blatant act of news fabrication"".
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also said in an interview with US television that there was ""no plan"" to hang people.
Following the initial reports, Hengaw later said that, according to information obtained through relatives, Soltani's execution had been postponed.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.
Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned the final toll could exceed 25,000.
Protesters have told the BBC that the lethal crackdown by security forces was unlike anything they had witnessed before.
In remarks on Sunday, Khamenei accused protesters of attacking police, the IRGC and other facilities including banks and mosques.

Iran's supreme leader warns of regional war if US attacks,2026-02-01T17:40:37.100Z," Barbara Plett Usher

","Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that any attack on his country would spark a regional conflict, as the US continues to build up its forces nearby.
""The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,"" Khamenei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.
Donald Trump earlier said Iran was in ""serious discussions"" and he hoped they would lead to something ""acceptable"", while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CNN he was ""confident that we can achieve a deal"" on Tehran's nuclear programme.
Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran over its nuclear ambitions and after its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests.
Araghchi said: ""Unfortunately, we have lost our trust [in] the US as a negotiating partner,"" but added the exchange of messages through friendly countries in the region was facilitating ""fruitful"" talks with Washington.
Iran's top security official Ali Larijani had previously said a framework for negotiations was progressing.
As part of its build up of forces, the US has sent its aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln to the region and late last week US Central Command said it was operating in the Arabian Sea.
""[Trump] regularly says that he brought ships... The Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things,"" added Khamenei.
Iran had been expected to begin a two-day live-fire naval exercise on Sunday in the Strait of Hormuz - one of the world's most important shipping lanes and a key route for energy supplies. However on Sunday Reuters quoted an Iranian official as saying the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) navy had no plans for such an exercise.
Around a fifth of the world's traded oil passes through the waterway, which is about 33km (21 miles) wide at its narrowest point between Iran and Oman. Iran has in the past threatened to close the strait if it were attacked.
The US has warned Iran against any ""unsafe and unprofessional behaviour"" near its forces in the area.
Araghchi responded by saying: ""The US military is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf.""
On Saturday, two explosions in Iran heightened anxiety in the country. Local authorities said a blast that killed one and hurt 14 at a building in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas was caused by a gas leak.
Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.
In the south-western city of Ahvaz, at least four people were killed in another explosion, with local authorities again blaming a gas leak, according to Iran's Tehran Times.
On Thursday, Trump said he had told Iran that it had to do two things to avoid US military action: ""Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters.""
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.

""The coup was suppressed,"" Tasnim quoted him as saying.

Israel to ban MSF from working in Gaza over refusal to provide staff list,2026-02-01T13:20:38.007Z," George Wright
","Israel says it will ban Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) from working in Gaza after the medical charity refused to hand over a list of its staff in the territory.
The Israeli government had ordered 37 organisations to submit documents about their local and international workers in Gaza, claiming some in MSF had links to armed groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The charity has vehemently denied this.
MSF announced on Friday that it would not share a list of its Palestinian and international staff with Israeli authorities as it had not secured ""assurances to ensure the safety of our staff"".
In response, Israel said it was ""moving to terminate the activities"" of MSF in Gaza.
The Israeli Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism said the decision followed ""MSF's failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region"".
On 30 December, Israel announced that it was going to revoke the licences of 37 international non-governmental organisations working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, saying they had failed to meet new registration requirements.
At the time the diaspora ministry said the measure was needed to prevent ""the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian structures"".
The groups - which include MSF, ActionAid and the Norwegian Refugee Council - were told their operations must end within 60 days.
The move was condemned by 10 countries, including the UK, France and Canada, who said the rules would have a severe impact on access to essential services.
MSF said in a statement on Friday that it had informed Israeli authorities that, as an ""exceptional measure"", it would share a list of names of its Palestinian and international staff, ""subject to clear parameters, with our staff safety at its core"".
""However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident in recent days that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required,"" it said.
""These included that any staff information would be used only for its stated administrative purpose and would not put colleagues at risk.""
On Sunday, it said the move was a ""pretext to obstruct humanitarian assistance"" to Gaza.
""Israeli authorities are forcing humanitarian organisations into an impossible choice between exposing staff to risk or interrupting critical medical care for people in desperate need,"" it said.
Sam Rose, director of Gaza affairs for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa, told the BBC that this will have ""major negative consequences on the ability of international organisations to provide healthcare inside Gaza"".
He said MSF had its own reasons for not handing over staff lists ""given the large numbers of staff of medical organisations and international organisations that have been killed over the past two years"".
A total of 1,700 healthcare staff have been killed in the war, including 15 MSF staff, the medical charity says.
MSF says it currently provides at least 20% of hospital beds in Gaza and operates around 20 health centres. Last year, it carried out more than 800,000 medical consultations and more than 10,000 infant deliveries, while providing drinking water.
The latest war in Gaza began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.

"Five killed in gas explosions in Iran, officials say",2026-02-01T05:12:13.993Z," Maia Davies
","Five people have been killed in two separate explosions in Iran which local officials and state media say were caused by gas leaks.
One person was killed and 14 injured in a blast at a residential building in the southern city of Bandar Abbas on the Gulf coast, a local official told Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency.
Another explosion killed four people in the south-western city of Ahvaz, the state-run Tehran Times reported.
It comes as tensions persist in the region after a build-up of US forces in the Gulf and pressure on Tehran from US President Donald Trump to strike a deal on its nuclear programme.
Trump was asked by journalists whether he had decided what to do in Iran while travelling to Florida on Saturday night and said: ""I certainly can't tell you that.""
But he added, reiterating comments made to Fox News earlier in the day, that Iran was talking ""seriously"" to Washington.
He said he hoped they would negotiate something acceptable, and noted that the US had ""very big powerful ships"" in the region.
Earlier, in the port city of Bandar Abbas, state TV said an explosion had ripped though an eight-storey building, ""destroying two floors, several vehicles, and shops"" in the Moallem Boulevard area.
The local fire department chief Mohammad Amin Liaqat said a preliminary assessment showed it had been caused by a gas leak and ""build-up"".
""My colleagues will give more details in the next few hours,"" he said in a video published by Mehr.
Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, a regional official, told the news agency that the injured had been taken to hospital.
Semi-official news agency Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.
Elsewhere, the Tehran Times reported a second explosion at a residential building in the Kianshahr neighbourhood of Ahvaz, near the border with Iraq.
It reported that emergency officials had rescued a child trapped beneath debris and transferred him for medical treatment.
Trump told Fox News on Saturday that Iran was ""negotiating"", adding that Washington could not share its plans with its allies in the Gulf.
""We'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens... we have a big fleet heading out there.""
Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian said conflict would not be in the interest of either country, nor the broader region.
""The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought and in no way seeks war,"" he said during a call with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, news agency AFP reported, citing a statement from Iran's presidency.
Separately, the head of the country's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani met the Qatari prime minister in Tehran on Saturday and ""reviewed ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region"", Qatar's foreign ministry said.
Larijani, whom the Kremlin said had also met Russia's President Vladimir Putin for talks on Friday, wrote on X: ""Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.""
Iran's foreign minister has said Tehran was open to talks with the US provided they were based on trust and respect, but cautioned that its missile defence system would ""never"" be the subject of negotiation.
Trump told Tehran on Wednesday that time was ""running out"" for it to reach a deal on its nuclear programme - which Iran insists is peaceful - and later said they must also ""stop killing protesters"" to avoid military action.
It came after he promised to intervene to help protesters who had been subject to a brutal crackdown in the country earlier this month, though he later said he had heard on good authority that the execution of demonstrators had stopped.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and was investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.

"Israeli air strikes kill at least 32 Palestinians in Gaza, rescue officials say",2026-02-01T01:30:24.395Z," Sofia Ferreira Santos
","At least 32 people have been killed in a wave of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, according to local authorities.
The civil defence agency, which is operated by Hamas, says children and women were among those killed. It added that in one attack, helicopter gunships hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the southern city of Khan Younis.
Palestinians have described these strikes as the heaviest since the second phase of the ceasefire, brokered by US President Trump last October, came into effect earlier this month.
The Israeli military confirmed that a number of strikes were carried out in response to what it said was a Hamas violation of the agreement on Friday.
Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce since it came into effect last year.
In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said ""eight terrorists were identified exiting the underground terror infrastructure in eastern Rafah"", an area in Gaza where Israeli forces are deployed under the October agreement.
The IDF said it had, together with the Israel Security Agency (ISA), struck targets in various locations including ""four commanders and additional terrorists"" as well as a weapons storage facility, a weapons manufacturing site and ""two launch sites belonging to Hamas in the central Gaza Strip"".
Hamas has condemned the strikes and urged the US to take immediate action, adding that ""these ongoing violations"" confirm that the Israeli government ""continues its brutal war of genocide against the strip"".
It said that seven of the victims were from one displaced family in Khan Younis, with a civil defence spokesman adding that the strikes hit residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station.
Officials at Gaza City's Shifa hospital said an air strike on the city hit a residential apartment, killing three children and two women.
""We found my three little nieces in the street. They say 'ceasefire' and all. What did those children do? What did we do?"" said Samer al-Atbash, an uncle of the three dead children, according to Reuters news agency.
Video footage and images from across Gaza showed several bodies being lifted out of rubble and a number of buildings destroyed.
The strikes come as the Rafah crossing, Gaza's border with Egypt, is due to reopen on Sunday after the IDF recovered the body of Israel's last hostage earlier this week.
Egypt's foreign ministry condemned the strikes in a statement seen by AFP news agency, and urged all parties to ""exercise the utmost restraint"".
Qatar, one of the key mediators during ceasefire talks, also denounced the ""repeated Israeli violations"", its foreign ministry said.
In January, US special envoy Steve Witkoff announced the start of phase two of the ceasefire deal.
Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed the ceasefire in October 2025, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.
Witkoff said phase two would see a technocratic Palestinian government established in Gaza, the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of the territory, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.
The war between Israel and Hamas began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.
Though Israel has previously disputed figures from the Hamas-run health ministry, a senior security source was reported by local media as saying that the military accepts that more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war in Gaza.
The health ministry's figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media. Israel does not allow news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza to report independently.

Israel split over plans to bring back death penalty for deadly attacks,2026-01-31T06:09:39.875Z," Yolande Knell
Middle East correspondent
","Israel has only twice used the death penalty against a convicted prisoner. The last time was more than sixty years ago, to hang the notorious Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann.
But in the wake of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, Israel's deadliest ever day, there is a political push to pass a highly controversial new capital punishment law, targeting Palestinians convicted by Israeli courts of fatal terrorist attacks.
""It's another brick in the wall of our defence,"" the far-right chair of the parliamentary national security committee, Zvika Fogel tells me. ""To bring in the death penalty is the most moral, the most Jewish and the most decent thing.""
But human rights groups see the bill as ""one of the most extreme legislative proposals"" in the history of Israel. They argue it is unethical, and because it is designed to apply only to Palestinians, they say it will bring about ""racialized capital punishment.""
There have been heated hearings in Israel's parliament involving rabbis, doctors, lawyers and security officials. Families whose loved ones were killed in the brutal assault on southern Israel more than two years ago, and in the fighting in the devastating war in Gaza that followed, have turned out to speak against and in favour of the legislation.
""In my view, only 10 or 20 per cent of the law is intended for justice, and the remaining percentage is deterrence and prevention,"" says bereaved mother, Dr Valentina Gusak, who backs the bill.
Addressing the national security committee, she displayed a photo of her 21-year-old daughter, Margarita who hoped to study medicine like both of her parents. She was killed with her boyfriend, Simon Vigdergaus as they fled the Nova music festival in 2023.
""It's preventive treatment – that's what it's called in medicine,"" says Dr Gusak about reintroducing capital punishment who believes it could have saved her daughter's life. ""It's a vaccine against the next murder, and we must ensure the future of our children.""
The death penalty does exist for certain crimes in Israel, but on the rare occasions when military courts previously handed down death sentences to convicted terrorists or enemy fighters, all were mitigated to life sentences following appeals.
The Eichmann case was exceptional. The SS Lieutenant Colonel was an architect of the Holocaust. In 1960, he was snatched from Argentina by Israeli secret service agents before being put on a lengthy public trial before a special court in Jerusalem.
Prior to that, a military captain, Meir Tobianski, was executed for treason following a makeshift court martial in June 1948, shortly after the Israeli state was established. He was posthumously exonerated.
Opponents of capital punishment have rejected it on religious, ethical and legal grounds arguing it goes against Jewish law, violates the right to life and brings a risk of executing innocent people. But Israeli human rights groups also argue that the proposed new law will deepen discrimination by targeting only Palestinians convicted of terrorism and not Jewish Israelis.
""The fact that we're even re-discussing bringing this back into the legal system in Israel is itself a low point,"" says Tal Steiner, executive director of the Israeli NGO, HaMoked.
""Beyond that our objection is that the law is racially designed, meant to apply only to Palestinians, never to Jews, only to people who kill Israeli citizens, never for example to Israeli citizens who kill Palestinians. The motivation is clear.""
The stated purpose of the draft legislation is to protect Israel, ""its citizens and its residents"", while ""increasing deterrence against the enemy"" and reducing the incentive ""to carry out kidnappings or take hostages in order to negotiate the release of terrorists"" as well as ""providing retribution"" for criminal acts.
Mandatory death sentences would apply in Israeli military courts which exclusively try Palestinians from the occupied West Bank. After a compulsory appeal against the verdict, those convicted of deadly terrorist attacks would be hanged within 90 days.
The bill would also allow the death penalty to be used within the same swift time frame in regular Israeli courts, but it would not be mandatory.
There have been past proposals to introduce capital punishment for what are seen as terrorist actions, but the security establishment was previously among the main opponents of such a move, asserting that it increased tensions and was not an effective deterrent.
Already, a high number of Palestinians who carry out deadly attacks on Israelis are shot dead in the process by the security forces or armed civilians.
When I meet Zvika Fogel from the far-right Jewish Power party which has put forward the new death penalty bill, he insists that the current heads of Israel's security services are behind its efforts. He dismisses the idea that the law is unfair.
""Let's be accurate, my bill talks about terrorists and about an act of terrorism, there's no discrimination here. The definition is very clear,"" he says. ""It's true that I don't think there's such a thing as a Jewish terrorist or a Jewish act of terrorism. It's a legal definition. I didn't go any other way.""
Jewish Power put forward the new death penalty bill early in 2023. Following the 7 October attacks, the legislation was put on hold because security officials advised it could jeopardise efforts to bring back the 251 hostages – living and dead – who had been seized and were being held in Gaza by Palestinian armed groups.
Last year, the head of Jewish Power, the national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir was one of the few ministers to vote against the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal which saw the last remaining hostages returned in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees – about 250 of whom were serving life or lengthy sentences, many for killing Israelis. He said he was opposed to all hostage agreements.
Jewish Power then threatened to leave the government if the death penalty legislation was not put to a vote. Last November, when it passed the first of three readings needed to become law by 39-16, in the 120-seat parliament or Knesset, Ben Gvir gave out sweets.
His party insists capital punishment will reduce the incentive for future hostage taking and prevent contentious prisoner swaps. Its members of parliament have taken to wearing a golden noose-shaped lapel pin.
""There won't be any [more] prisoners released,"" says Zvika Fogel. ""For a prisoner who committed murder, there'll be a death penalty so there won't be a prisoner to make a deal on. It will prevent hostages being taken to be used as bargaining chips.""
In parliament, Limor Son Har-Melech, another member of Jewish Power who sponsors the bill has related her personal story. In 2003, she and her husband - who lived in a West Bank settlement - were attacked by Palestinian gunmen while in their car. Her husband was killed and she was injured, leading her to give birth by an emergency caesarean section.
Son Har-Melech explains that one of her husband's killers went on to be released in a previous exchange deal to bring home an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza. She says he went on to command a deadly attack on another Israeli and take part in the 7 October attacks, before he was killed during the Gaza war.
Some 1,200 people were killed in the shocking assault on southern Israel just over two years ago. It triggered the deadliest ever war in Gaza, where more than 71,600 Palestinians have been killed according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
Many see that the public mood in Israel has shifted in favour of more draconian punishments. But Arab-Israeli parliamentarian, Aida Touma-Suleiman, who represents the opposition Hadash party, says legislators should be careful how they respond.
""He is feeding into the revenge and the anger that is existing among society,"" she says of Ben Gvir. ""But you cannot run legislation and courts by instincts of revenge.""
Touma-Suleiman opposes the death penalty on principle and argues the bill also goes against international law and past treaties signed by Israel. If the legislation passes two more parliamentary votes and becomes law, she believes Supreme Court judges will strike it down.
However, she points out that this will prove a political point for Jewish Power in an election year. As part of the government, it has been taking steps to try to reduce the power of the courts.
""It's a win-win situation for Ben Gvir and his party to promote such a law. Because if this law actually passes, it's for their constituency,"" Touma-Suleiman tells me. ""If he managed to pass it then I'm sure the Supreme Court will ask the Knesset to cancel the law, and he can start to say with the rest of the right-wing: 'You see they want to run the country when we are the ones who are elected!'""
In social media videos shot in Israeli jails, Ben Gvir has posed with bound and blindfolded prisoners who are said to be members of the Hamas Nukhba force which carried out the 7 October attacks. He boasts that they receive the ""minimum of minimum conditions.""
According to a recent article by the Israeli news site, Walla, a record high number of 110 Palestinian security detainees have died under the minister's policies in the past two and a half years.
The UN Committee against Torture said late last year that it was deeply concerned about reports indicating ""a de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture and ill treatment"" of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. It said such allegations had ""gravely intensified"" after the 2023 attacks. Israel has denied the claims.
While the final text of the death penalty law is being drawn up, another parliamentary committee is working on a separate bill to set up a dedicated military tribunal for the Nukhba prisoners.
They are expected to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity much as Eichmann did six decades ago. Those convicted could also face the death penalty.
After many countries around the world abolished capital punishment, Israel is taking steps in the opposite direction.

I mocked the Saudi leader on YouTube - then my phone was hacked and I was beaten up in London,2026-01-31T00:50:39.666Z," Joe Tidy
Cyber correspondent
BBC World Service
","With hundreds of millions of views, YouTuber Ghanem al-Masarir was flying high.
From his flat in Wembley, the loud-mouthed and sometimes offensive comedian was making waves as a critic of the Saudi Arabian royal family. But as well as fans, he'd made some powerful enemies.
The first thing al-Masarir noticed was that his phones were behaving weirdly. They had become very slow, with the batteries running out quickly.
Then he noticed seeing the same faces appear in different parts of London. People who seemed to be Saudi regime supporters began stopping him in the street, harassing and filming him. But how did they know where he was all the time?
Al-Masarir feared his phone was being used to spy on him. Cyber experts would later confirm he'd become the latest victim to be spied on with the infamous Pegasus hacking tool.
""It was something that I couldn't comprehend. They can see your location. They can turn on the camera. They can turn on the microphone, listen to you,"" al-Masarir tells the BBC. ""They got your data, all pictures, everything. You feel you've been violated.""
On Monday, after six years of legal battles, the High Court in London ruled Saudi Arabia was responsible, and ordered the kingdom to pay al-Masarir more than £3m ($4.1m) in compensation.
Al-Masarir's iPhones had been hacked in 2018 after he clicked on links in three text messages seemingly sent from news outlets as special membership offers.
It led to him being stalked, harassed and in August of that year, beaten up in central London.
The court heard two strangers had approached al-Masarir and shouted at him, demanding to know who he was to talk about the Saudi royal family, before punching him in the face and then continuing to attack him.
Passers-by intervened and the two men retreated, calling the YouTuber a ""slave of Qatar"" and saying they were going to ""teach him a lesson"".
The High Court judge described the physical attack as premeditated and noted that one of the assailants was wearing an earpiece.
""There is a compelling basis"" that the assault and the hack ""was directed or authorised by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or agents acting on its behalf,"" Mr Justice Saini said in his written judgement.
""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had a clear interest in and motivation to shut down the claimant's public criticism of the Saudi government,"" the judge ruled.
After the assault, the harassment continued. In 2019, a child approached al-Masarir at a Kensington café and sang a song praising King Salman, the Saudi monarch.
This incident was filmed and posted on social media, began trending with its own hashtag, and was even broadcast on state-owned television in Saudi Arabia.
On the same day, a man walked up to al-Masarir as he was leaving a west London restaurant and told him, ""Your days are numbered"", before walking off.
Al-Masarir was born in Saudi Arabia but has lived in Britain for more than 20 years, originally coming to study in Portsmouth.
He is now a British citizen and lives in Wembley, but no longer ventures far from home - going into central London is still frightening for him after he was attacked.
The 45-year-old rose to fame in the Arabic-speaking world for his satirical YouTube videos criticising Saudi rulers, in particular the crown prince and de facto ruler Mohamed bin Salman.
Al-Masarir's humorous takes - and sometimes personal and offensive attacks on the Saudi government - often went viral, generating more than 345 million views.
In his most watched clip - which has 16 million views - he criticised the authorities for being angry about a viral video of girls dancing in Saudi Arabia. Mysteriously, the sound has been removed on YouTube and al-Masarir has no idea how or when the video was edited.
Since al-Masarir was hacked and attacked he has lost his confidence and become depressed and fearful. The once funny and outspoken personality agreed to talk to the BBC - but was reserved and didn't want to fully show his face.
He hasn't posted a video for three years and says in spite of his legal victory, the Saudi government has succeeded in silencing him.
""No amount of money can repay the harm this has done to me,"" he says. ""The hack has really changed me. I am not the same Ghanem I used to be.""

It was spyware experts from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab who confirmed al-Masarir had been hacked with Pegasus spyware. They sent an analyst to London and deemed it highly likely the hack had been orchestrated by Saudi Arabia.
Pegasus is a powerful and controversial hacking tool made by Israeli company NSO Group. NSO Group insists it only sells its spyware to governments to help track terrorists and criminals.
But Citizen Lab has discovered it on phones belonging to politicians, journalists and dissidents - including al-Masarir.
When al-Masarir first tried to bring a claim against Saudi Arabia, the kingdom argued it was protected from legal action under the State Immunity Act 1978.
But in 2022 the court ruled Saudi Arabia did not have immunity. Since, then the country has not been represented in any further proceedings.
""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has failed to serve a defence or to respond to this application and has breached multiple further orders. It appears unlikely to participate in the claim,"" the High Court judge concluded.
The total damages awarded are £3,025,662.83 but it's not clear if Saudi Arabia will pay.
The BBC contacted the Saudi embassy in London but has not had a reply.
Al-Masarir says he is determined to enforce the judgement and is willing to use international courts if necessary. But no amount of money will make up for how the hack has turned his life upside down, he says.
""I feel depressed that they got away with something like this in London - in Great Britain.""

Trump tells Iran to drop nuclear aims and stop killing protesters to avoid military action,2026-01-30T14:59:56.026Z," Tabby Wilson
","Donald Trump says he has told Iran it has to do ""two things"" to avoid military action, as the US builds up its forces in the Gulf.
""Number one, no nuclear. And number two, stop killing protesters,"" the US president said, adding that ""they are killing them by the thousands"".
""We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn't have to use them.""
His latest remarks follow weeks of pressure on Iran to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme.
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said armed forces were ready ""with their fingers on the trigger"" to ""immediately and powerfully respond"" to any aggression.
Asked by the BBC whether he supported a potential US strike on Iran, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was talking to allies about how to prevent Iran from developing nuclear activities and killing protesters.
""The aim here is that Iran shouldn't be able to develop nuclear weapons. That's hugely important,"" Starmer said while on a visit to China.
""And of course we need to deal with the fact that they are repressing protesters, killing protesters. It's grotesque what is happening. And so that's where our focus is and we're working with allies to that end.""
Araghchi, meanwhile, was in Istanbul on Friday for talks focused on averting the threat of US military action.
He said Iran was ready for talks with the US ""if these negotiations are based on mutual interest, mutual respect and mutual trust"" during a news conference with Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.
But he added that Iran's missile defence systems would ""never be the subject"" of talks and reiterated his government's claim that Iran's nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.
Fidan said Turkey was ""ready to support any peaceful solutions to the problems"".
Earlier on, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office said he had told his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian in a phone call that Turkey was willing to help ""de-escalate"" tensions between Iran and the US.
Trump made his latest comments at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania. Earlier this week, he wrote on Truth Social: ""Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.""
He warned that a ""massive Armada is heading to Iran"", and it was ""ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary"".
In response, Araghchi said: ""Iran has always welcomed a mutually beneficial, fair and equitable NUCLEAR DEAL - on equal footing, and free from coercion, threats, and intimidation - which ensures Iran's rights to PEACEFUL nuclear technology, and guarantees NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.""
""Such weapons have no place in our security calculations and we have NEVER sought to acquire them,"" he added.
Earlier this month, Trump said that the US would come to the ""rescue"" of Iranian protesters if authorities used violence against them.
Demonstrations began in late December after a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, but swiftly evolved into a crisis of legitimacy for the country's clerical leadership.
Tehran locals told the BBC that the crackdown on protestors was unlike anything that they had witnessed before.
Though Trump initially promised that ""help is on the way"", he later said that he had been told on good authority that the execution of demonstrators had stopped.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,479 people since the unrest began, including 6,092 protesters, 118 children and 214 people affiliated with the government.
It is also investigating approximately 17,000 more reported deaths.
Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by ""rioters"".
The European Union has since added Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to its terrorist list, in addition to placing new sanctions on six entities and 15 individuals in Iran.

Syrian government reaches deal with Kurdish-led forces,2026-01-30T12:42:37.263Z," Hafsa Khalil
","Syria's government has reached a deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance that would see the gradual intergration of Kurdish forces and institutions into the state.
This comes after weeks of clashes which saw Syrian troops reclaim large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under SDF control for more than a decade.
US envoy Tom Barrack called it ""a profound and historic milestone in Syria's journey toward national reconciliation, unity, and enduring stability"".
Earlier this month - and after its major territorial losses - the SDF agreed to a ceasefire that saw much of its hold brought under government control, but reports of clashes continued.
Much like that 14-point agreement, Friday's deal would see SDF withdraw from points of contact, its members join the Syrian army and government, and the integration of its administrative and civil bodies into those of the state.
The SDF said the agreement also includes the formation of a military division consisting of three brigades made of its members.
The statement on X added that an agreement on the civil and educational rights for Kurdish people was also reached, as well as a guarantee that those displaced would be allowed to return to their homes.
Part of the deal saw the transfer of prisons, oil and gas fields - which were under SDF control - to Damascus.
Syrian troops seized control of the Omar facility, the country's largest oilfield, after the SDF pulled back. Earlier, the army took the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river.
The Kurds previously controlled nearly a third of Syria's territory with the support of the US after it helped defeat the Islamic State (IS) group.
Their recent losses mark the biggest change of control in the country since the toppling of former leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, which ended Syria's 13-year civil war.
Since leading the rebel offensive that overthrew the Assad regime, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify a divided Syria.
After the ceasefire was agreed on 18 January, he said he hoped it would allow the country to ""end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress"".
Sharaa also issued a decree recognising Kurdish cultural, linguistic and civil rights by making Kurdish a national language, granting nationality to stateless Kurds, and declaring their new year a national holiday.
This is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946.
This agreement followed months of stalled negotiations over a March 2025 integration deal, which both sides had accused each other of trying to derail.

Syria's Kurds sense US betrayal as government forces push them back,2026-01-30T10:39:58.200Z," Orla Guerin
Senior international correspondent
northeastern Syria
","As a veteran Syrian Kurdish fighter, Commander Azad – whose nom-de-guerre means freedom - walks with a limp and wears his battle scars with pride.
""My leg was injured when we were bombed by a Turkish warplane in 2018,"" he says. ""And this was shrapnel from a suicide bomber,"" he adds, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a deep gouge in his arm. ""My back, abdomen and lower body were all injured in four separate attacks by Daesh,"" he says, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group (IS).
His latest wound is below the surface, and cuts deep – what he sees as betrayal by a former friend, the United States. After the Islamic State (IS) group seized around a third of Syria and Iraq in 2014, the US and the Kurds worked hand in glove to drive them out.
Not anymore.
""History will hold them accountable,"" says the commander, who has a handle-bar moustache and wears a green fringed scarf around his neck. ""Morally it's not right. But we will keep fighting until our last breath. We are not cry-babies.""
Their current fight is with the central government in Damascus which wants to extend its control across all of Syria, including the Kurdish autonomous region in the north-east.
In the past two weeks government troops have pushed the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) out of resource-rich areas they have controlled for a decade – since defeating IS.
As conflict has flared, the White House has strongly backed Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former Jihadi. That's a slap in the face for the Kurds. The SDF lost 11,000 fighters battling the jihadis of IS.
Commander Azad compares the president to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the late founder of IS. ""They are the same thing. After Jolani took over, Syria will always be a war zone,"" he says, referring to the president by his fighting name, Abu Mohammed Al Jolani.
Having fought US troops in Iraq, Al Sharaa set up an al-Qaeda offshoot in Syria, which was in fact fiercely opposed to IS, though the groups had similar roots. He later broke with al-Qaeda, then in December 2024 swept to power in Damascus, ousting Bashar al Assad.
In the eyes of the Kurds, Al Sharaa is still a Jihadi, but now in a suit.
Commander Azad stiffly climbs the stairs to an open rooftop with a commanding view of flat countryside.
Below us sheep graze in the fields and clothing flaps on a washing line in a back garden. But a pick-up truck with an anti-aircraft machine gun is parked outside the door, and there is a cluster of troops in camouflage uniforms. This is the SDF's last checkpoint in their stronghold of Hassakeh province.
""They [Syrian government forces] are in an Arab village seven kilometres from here,"" he says, gesturing to the horizon. ""So far, there is no danger. I hope there will be no war, but if it comes, 'Let it be welcome,'"" he says, quoting Che Guevara, Cuba's revolutionary hero.
A fragile ceasefire between the two sides was due expire on 7 February. A deal has just been announced to extend the truce and begin the integration of Kurdish forces into the Syrian army. A previous deal on integration, signed last March, failed.
""We don't want war, but if we are forced down that path we will fight back,"" says Siyamend Ali, of the People's Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia that is the backbone of the SDF.
""Every neighbourhood will turn into a hell for them,"" he added.
Ali has already seen too many losses in the fight against IS. His fallen friends number in the hundreds.
""There were friends I studied with in school and university, and friends I played with. They were from my family and from neighbouring families,"" says Ali, in a low and weary voice. ""They rose to martyrdom. Now I walk in their footsteps.""
We met at another frontline position - where mounds of dark soil formed fresh defences. If all-out war comes, it will be a losing battle for the Kurds. But there are implications far beyond this corner of Syria.
Since the defeat of IS in Syria in 2019, this area has been a holding ground for the remnants of the group's so-called ""caliphate"". Kurdish-run prisons hold about 8,000 suspected IS fighters, and around 34,000 of their wives and families are detained in camps. Will the gates remain locked if this region becomes a battleground?
The Syrian government has taken control of one camp, al-Hol, in eastern Hassakeh.
When we visited last October - with an armed escort - we got a hostile reception from veiled women, clad head to toe in black. One ran a finger across her neck, as if slitting a throat.
The other main camp, called Roj remains in Kurdish hands. It's home to more than 2,000 foreign women and children, who have been convicted of nothing.
Rows of blue and white tents offer little protection from biting winter cold. Children play on a carpet of mud, ringed by fences, walls and watch towers. Roj is a prison in all but name.
We returned there this week to find the camp manager Hekmiya Ibrahim increasingly worried. She is slight but determined, a powerhouse in a headscarf. The detainees have been emboldened by the changes beyond the wire, she says.
""When news reached them [of the government take-over of al-Hol] everyone immediately came out of their tents, chanting 'Allahu Akbar' [God is greatest]. The sound of their chanting echoed throughout the camp.""
Taking her phone from her pocket she shows me pictures of the black and white IS flag, newly daubed on one of the walls of the camp. And she recounts threats made to staff. ""Statements were directed at us such as 'We will return', 'You are infidels', and 'ISIS will end you,'"" she tells us.
She warns that some in the camp – even the young – pose a threat to the world.
""There was an incident last October involving twin brothers from Turkmenistan,"" she says. ""One killed the other and later said he would do it again if his brother came back to life.""
The reason – the slain brother was not radical enough.
But in the camp's cheerless food market we met women who pointed out that their children are guilty of nothing and pleaded for them to have a normal life. We spoke to two women from North Africa, who did not want to be identified.
""I want to leave this place,"" one woman said, ""so my daughter can study and live her life. She has the right to an education, to visit a park, to get medical care. If she's ill, God forbid, she should be able to go to hospital like any other child, without soldiers going with us.""
When challenged about the fact that they themselves came to join IS, her friend jumped in. ""Firstly, I didn't join the organisation,"" she said. ""My husband forced me to come here. He died, and my children and I are paying the price. Our children think the entire world is a camp behind a fence.""
Forty Britons remain trapped behind that fence – 25 children among them. We came across one of them – a polite boy speaking good English who we cannot identify. He shook hands with one of my BBC's colleagues, and asked, ""How are you?""
One woman from the UK told us she wanted to go home but was afraid to be interviewed as camp guards were hovering. Two other British women refused to speak, including Shamima Begum, who left London as a schoolgirl to join IS. Camp staff told us Begum was ""hiding in her tent"".
Recalling her decision to come to IS territory, a Bosnian woman broke down and wept. ""I feel so bad because I came here with my husband, and I destroyed my life,"" she said. ""I can't explain myself how I was stupid enough to come here. It was a mistake.""
She says her husband was not radical when they met in college but changed over time. By then they already had a child. Her second child was born in Syria.
""We are really worried because we hear stories that there might be a war,"" she told us. ""We really hope they will fix this issue peacefully and that finally we can go back to our countries.""
As the sands shift in Syria countries that have been willing to leave their citizens in Kurdish camps indefinitely may have to think again – the UK included.

"Israeli media cite official accepting Hamas figure of 70,000 war dead",2026-01-29T22:23:35.615Z," Dan Johnson
BBC correspondent
Jerusalem
","Israeli media report that a senior security source has said the military accepts that more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war in Gaza.
Israel has previously cast doubt on figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.
But their figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media.
The war began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.
Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
It says at least 492 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.
Israel has always disputed the Hamas figures and said before last year's ceasefire it had killed 1,600 fighters since 7 October 2023 and another 22,000 combatants in the war.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously said it believed two or three civilians had been killed for every dead militant.
Now a senior military source has indicated to Israeli journalists, including those from Haaretz and the Times of Israel, that the total number given by the Hamas health ministry is largely accurate, even though they have not been able to break down how many were combatants and how many died as a direct result of the fighting.
Following the latest Israeli media reports, a military official said the details published did not reflect official IDF data.
""Any publication or report on this matter will be released through official and orderly channels,"" the IDF official said.

'I can breathe again' says Israeli hostage held for nearly 500 days in Gaza,2026-01-29T16:25:40.823Z," Lucy Manning
Special correspondent
","A former Israeli hostage who was held for nearly 500 days in Gaza says the return of the body of the final hostage this week means all the released captives can ""now breathe and start our lives again"".
Thirty-year-old Sasha Troufanov, an Amazon electronics engineer, was taken hostage on 7 October 2023 by Palestinian Islamic Jihad gunmen. His fiancée Sapir Cohen, mother and grandmother were also kidnapped and taken to Gaza. The women were released after more than 50 days as hostages. He was freed a year ago, after 498 days in captivity.
In his first international interview, Troufanov, on a visit to London, told BBC News that with the return on Monday of Ran Gvili's body meaning all the hostages were back ""it felt wonderful. We waited so long for this to happen.
""I was carrying this burden ever since I came back. It was like a weight on my shoulders that kept me from coming back to my life. Although we were released, we didn't really come out of Gaza because our friends and brothers were still there.""
But the moment was bittersweet for him as Monday was also the birthday of his father Vitaly. Troufanov only discovered his father had been murdered on 7 October on the day he was released in February 2025 and realised his dad wasn't there to meet him.
Troufanov and Cohen had been visiting his family on Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza when Palestinian gunmen stormed their homes. Cohen rolled herself up in blanket and hid under the bed but they were both captured. Troufanov was punched and also stabbed in the shoulder.
""I saw the terrorist with so much anger and hate in his face, holding his knife trying to stab me even more.""
As the attackers tried to take Troufanov off the kibbutz he managed to momentarily escape but when he gave up running they still shot him twice in each leg.
""I just felt the rush of pain going through my brain and I fell to the ground then one of the terrorists hit me with the rifle from the back of my head and split it open.""
When he arrived to Gaza, he says he was then beaten by civilians and thought ""this is the moment you're going to die"".
While in Gaza, Troufanov received almost no medical treatment. He was taken once to a family home and once to a hospital where his broken leg was wrapped first with a wooden broom and then with part of a metal grill.
Unlike many other hostages, he was held almost entirely in isolation. For only two of the 498 days in captivity did Troufanov see another hostage.
At the start he was held above ground, for more than six weeks locked in a cage and given barely enough food to survive. Here, he says he experienced sexual harassment where one guard repeatedly tried to encourage him to do a sexual act on himself. He also says a hidden camera filmed him when he was allowed a shower once a week.
""I noticed it and I took the shower trying to avoid my private parts towards this angle, but I had to do it because I needed to shower.""
Taken underground to the tunnels, Troufanov says he was left for months alone, his captors only bringing food then leaving him in a silent, cramped, humid space so dark he couldn't see his hand in front of his face.
""I remember feeling that I am buried underneath the ground while I am still alive. I was losing it. I was having a hard time to find hope in this place. Many times I lost hope completely. I said to myself: 'This is the last place you will see alive.'""
It is the first time since 2014 that there are no Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Two hundred and fifty-one people were taken captive during the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.
Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025, at least 492 Palestinians have been killed, the health ministry says, as well as four Israeli soldiers.
Now all the hostages, those alive and those who were killed, have returned to Israel the second phase of US President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza can commence. The key Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is set to open on an ongoing basis for the first time since May 2024, as required under the plan.
It also envisages the full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups; a technocratic Palestinian government; and the reconstruction of Gaza.
Sasha Troufanov believes that these measures aren't enough to ensure an attack like the one on 7 October won't happen again.
""Rebuilding Gaza, after what happened in the war, is understandable. But first of all we need to make sure that the people of Gaza will stop trying to hurt Israel. The terrorists were telling me: 'We will do this again and again.'
""Rebuilding Gaza and opening the Rafah crossing is in vain as it will never solve the real problem. We need to find a way to make this hatred and encouragement of terrorist activity stop.""
The former hostage now has to rehabilitate mentally and physically. He is currently on crutches after surgery on his leg but hopes to dance at his wedding to Sapir Cohen in a few weeks. ""It's a victory: overcoming hate and fear and saying to ourselves: 'We will build life together and we will continue.'""

Iran's internet is returning - but not for everyone,2026-01-28T17:54:08.404Z," Farshad Bayan
BBC Persian
","Nearly three weeks into one of the most extreme internet shutdowns in history, some of Iran's 92 million citizens are beginning to get back online - but access appears to be tightly controlled.
The country cut off internet access on 8 January, in what is widely seen as an attempt to stem the flow of information about a government crackdown on protesters.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet was blocked in response to what he described as ""terrorist operations"".
Now there is evidence that some internet access has returned - but independent analysis indicates much of the country is still effectively cut off from the outside world.
Iran's reformist Shargh newspaper has reported that some officials had claimed mobile internet had been restored.
However, it said many users still do not have full access and can only connect intermittently and for very limited periods, often after repeated attempts.
Firms which monitor web traffic say there are signs of the internet being used inconsistently, raising questions about who is able to connect, and under what conditions.
""What we're seeing isn't a return to normal,"" said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at network intelligence firm Kentik.
""Major platforms are being allowed and blocked at different times during the day.""
Independent internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported similar findings.
Madory said the pattern could instead indicate authorities are testing a new system to block web traffic, with changes being made in real-time.
Amir Rashidi, director of cyber security at the Miaan Group said this points to only a certain number of people, who have been approved by the government, being the only ones with access.
Human rights organisations say this control over internet access has played a big role in limiting information about the crackdown on protesters.
The Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said as of 26 January it had confirmed the deaths of 5,925 protesters. It warned the final toll could be several times higher, with a further 17,091 reported deaths currently being reviewed.
Internet rights observers say the unrest may have given the authorities an opportunity to accelerate long-planned efforts to tighten control over the internet - measures which would likely have faced far stronger resistance under normal circumstances.
According to sources cited by Shargh, internet access in Iran has effectively been divided into multiple levels - ranging from a complete shutdown to normal access - with current connectivity still far from a full restoration.
According to sources cited by the newspaper, foreign messaging apps, including WhatsApp, will remain restricted. There are some local communication platforms accessible inside the country, although observers have raised security and privacy concerns about their use.
However, in recent days some users have reported being able to connect intermittently to the outside world, using services such as Google Meet, Telegram, Facebook Messenger or FaceTime to contact family members.
Rashidi said this may be because selectively granting access to certain parts of the internet can have the side effect of letting tools such as a virtual private network (VPN) function - even if briefly.
VPNs are ways to securely connect devices online, which can be used to view content blocked because of your location.
""As long as there is any ability to transmit even a single bit of data, it is possible to find ways to use VPNs,"" Rashidi said.
But he said the evidence so far suggests the authorities are determined to prevent VPNs from operating and to keep control over who can connect.
After nearly three weeks of internet disruption, Iran's Minister of Communications Sattar Hashemi said on 26 January the daily losses caused by the shutdown amount to nearly five trillion tomans ($35m; £25m).
Amid mounting economic pressure, authorities appear to have introduced tightly controlled forms of internet access for some businesses, which analysts say may be part of a plan to manage connectivity more selectively.
Business figures told the BBC in some cities, members of the Chamber of Commerce are granted just 20 to 30 minutes of unfiltered internet access per day.
Even then, they claim this is only under supervision and after completing multiple stages of identity verification.
One member of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the access was ""fully rationed and strictly time-limited"".
They added if work was not completed within the allotted time, the entire verification process had to be repeated.
The same source said some businesspeople had also been required to sign commitments not to send files related to the protests.
They called the system ""effectively paralysing and humiliating"" given the number of people involved, and said it had generated widespread dissatisfaction among traders.
Internet freedom observers at FilterWatch have previously warned the authorities are rapidly putting in place new systems and rules aimed at cutting Iran off from the international internet.
And Madory said, looking at web traffic data, the patterns suggest a full restoration of internet access in Iran may never occur.

'Don't take us to a hospital': Iran protesters treated in secret to avoid arrest,2026-01-28T17:28:08.868Z," Soroush Pakzad
BBC Persian
","""People helped us and we got into a car... I said, 'Don't take us to a hospital.'""
Tara and her friend were attending a protest in the central Iranian city of Isfahan when security forces arrived on motorcycles and began shouting at the crowd.
""My friend told an armed member of the security forces, 'Just don't shoot us,' and he immediately fired several shots at us. We fell to the ground. All our clothes were covered in blood,"" she said.
They were bundled into a stranger's car, but Tara said they were too frightened to be taken to the hospital because of the risk of being arrested. ""All the alleyways were full of security forces, so I asked a couple standing at their front door to let us in.""
They stayed at the couple's home until it was almost dawn and then managed to find a doctor they knew, who cleaned the birdshot wounds on their legs, according to Tara.
She said a surgeon was later able to remove some of the birdshot at home but warned them: ""They cannot all be removed and will remain in your bodies.""
All names in this article have been changed for their safety.
Warning: This story contains details and images which some readers might find distressing.
The full scale of the bloodshed resulting from the crackdown by security forces on the anti-government protests that swept across Iran this month is still not known because of an internet shutdown and a ban on reporting by most international news organisations.
But the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, 112 children, 50 bystanders and 214 affiliated with the government. It is also investigating reports of 17,091 more deaths.
At least another 11,000 protesters were seriously wounded, according to HRANA.
Some of them have told the BBC that they have avoided seeking treatment for their injuries at hospitals because they fear being arrested.
That has left them reliant on doctors, nurses and other volunteers willing to risk their own safety by treating them secretly at their homes.
Healthcare workers have also told the BBC that security forces are present in hospitals and that they are constantly monitoring patients' medical records to identify injured protesters.
Nima, a surgeon in Tehran, said he witnessed many young people being injured in the streets on his way to work on 8 January, when authorities responded to the escalating protests with lethal force.
""I put one of the wounded in the boot of my car to take him to hospital, as I was worried that we would get in trouble if we were stopped by the police,"" he told the BBC.
Nima said armed officers stopped him but allowed him to go after seeing his hospital identification card.
""For almost 96 hours straight - without interruption, without sleep, without even closing our eyes for a moment - we were operating. We were crying and operating. Nobody complained.""
""All our clothes and hospital gowns were covered in blood - our outer clothes, our underwear, everything was soaked in the blood of these young people.""
Nima described operating on one man who had been shot in the leg and face at a protest.
""A bullet had entered through his chin, ripped through his mouth and exited through his upper jaw,"" he recalled.
Nima also said many of the young people treated at his hospital suffered gunshot wounds to their vital organs and limbs that required amputation and left them with permanent disabilities.
Iranian authorities have said more than 3,100 people have been killed during the unrest, but that majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by ""rioters"".
Health ministry spokesman Hossein Shokri was also quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency as saying that around 13,000 operations had been carried out during the unrest.
""Fortunately, people trust the ministry of health and hospitals, and confidence that all injured individuals are treated impartially in medical centres has led around 3,000 people who had been treating themselves at home over the past six days to seek care at hospitals,"" he added.
The head of the Farabi Eye Hospital in Tehran, Dr Qasem Fakhrai, told Isna, another semi-official news agency, that it had treated a total of 700 patients with severe eye injuries requiring emergency surgery as of 10 January, and referred almost 200 to other hospitals. He said almost all of the patients were admitted after 8 January.
Saeed told the BBC that his friend's eyes were hit by birdshot fired by security forces during a protest in the central city of Arak.
Local doctors told him to go to a specialist eye hospital in Tehran, he said.
Upon arrival, nurses took protesters with eye injuries to operating theatres through the back by using staff lifts.
According to Saeed's friend, around 200 people with eye injuries from different cities were being treated at that hospital.
""He had two operations, but the surgeon did not charge him,"" Saeed said.
A healthcare worker in Tehran also said that doctors were trying to avoid mentioning gunshot wounds in medical records because they were being constantly monitored by security forces.
Sina took his brother to a hospital after he was shot in the legs during protests in Tehran.
""It was like a battlefield hospital - there were so many wounded that there were no blankets or medical kits,"" Sina told the BBC.
""When I asked a nurse for a blanket for my brother, she told me to bring one from home because there were too many injured and not enough supplies.""
Sina said they had no choice but to give their actual ID number in order to use their health insurance. ""At any moment, the security forces could raid our home,"" he added.
In smaller cities, the situation is believed to be even more dire.
Reports received by the BBC said security forces had abducted patients from hospitals and that they had not been seen again.
Human rights groups have also said that medics and others who have treated injured protesters are now themselves being targeted by security forces.
Iran Human Rights (IHR) said last week its sources on the ground in Iran had reported the arrest of at least five doctors and a volunteer first responder.
""Security agencies appear to be aiming to intimidate the public and obstruct treatment for injured protesters by arresting doctors and raiding makeshift medical shelters,"" the Norway-based organisation warned.
And this week, sources close to Dr Alireza Golchini, a surgeon from the northern city of Qazvin, said he had been beaten up at his home by security forces when they arrested him for treating injured protesters.
They added that he had been accused of ""moharebeh"" (enmity against God) - an offence that can carry the death penalty under Iranian law.

","""My friends are all like me. We all know someone who was killed in the protests.""
For Parisa, a 29-year-old from Tehran, the crackdown by security forces in Iran earlier this month was unlike anything she had witnessed before.
""In the most widespread previous protests, I didn't personally know a single person who had been killed,"" she said.
Parisa said she knew at least 13 people who had been killed since protests over worsening economic conditions erupted in the capital on 28 December and then evolved into one of the deadliest periods of anti-government unrest in the history of the Islamic Republic.
With one human rights group reporting that the number of people confirmed killed has passed 6,000, several young Iranians able speak to the BBC in recent days - despite a near-total internet shutdown - have described the personal toll. Their names have been changed for safety reasons.
Parisa said one 26-year-old woman she knew was killed by ""a hail of bullets in the street"" when the protests escalated across the country on Thursday, 8 January, and Friday, 9 January, and authorities responded with lethal force to crush them.
She herself took part in protests in the north of Tehran that Thursday, which she insisted were peaceful.
""No-one was violent and no-one clashed with the security forces. But on Friday night they still opened fire on the crowd,"" she said.
""The smell of gunpowder and bullets filled the neighbourhoods where clashes were taking place.""
Mehdi, 24, who is also from Tehran, echoed her assessment of the scale of the protests and violence.
""I had never seen anything even close to this level of turnout and such killings and violence by the security forces,"" he said.
""Despite the killings on Thursday [8 January] and threats of more killings on Friday, people came out, because many of them could no longer endure it and had nothing left to lose,"" he added.
Mehdi described witnessing multiple killings of protesters at close range by security forces.
""I saw a young man killed right in front of my eyes with two live rounds,"" he said.
""Motorcyclists shot a young man in the face with a shotgun. He fell on the spot and never got back up.""
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people since the unrest began, including 5,804 protesters, 92 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. It is also investigating 17,000 more reported deaths.
Skylar Thompson, from Hrana, told the BBC the confirmed number of dead was very likely to rise.
""We are really committed to ensuring that every single piece of verified information that we report on sits next to a name and a location,"" she added.
Another group, Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.
Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by ""rioters"".
International news organisations are often refused visas to Iran which severely limits their ability to gather information about what's going on inside the country. But videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.
Sahar, a 27-year-old from the capital, said she knew seven people who had been killed.
She described how the security forces' response to the unrest escalated rapidly on 8 January.
During a protest that evening, Sahar and her friends sought refuge in a nearby house after tear gas was fired.
""My friend stuck his head out of a window to see what was going on and they shot him in the neck,"" she said.
Another friend was wounded by pellets and later bled to death after avoiding going to hospital out of fear of being detained, according to Sahar.
Sahar said a third friend died while being detained by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC).
""They [officers] told his family to come to the IRGC intelligence office. After a few days they rang and said, 'Come and collect the body.'""
On 9 January, Sahar said, live ammunition was fired openly and ""without mercy"" by uniformed security personnel.
""They were pointing lasers at people, and locals were opening their car park doors for us to hide,"" she said.
The communications blackout compounded the trauma.
""Right now there's no news at all,"" Sahar said. ""Without internet or phone lines we had no idea what was happening to anyone. We could barely get calls through just to get bits of news.""
Parham, 27, described widespread use of pellet guns by security forces in Tehran, particularly targeting protesters' faces and eyes.
One of his friends, Sina, 23, was shot in the forehead and eye on 9 January.
""We took him to a hospital, but the doctor could only give us a prescription and told us to leave as soon as possible,"" Parham said.
At an eye hospital, he added, wounded protesters arrived constantly.
""Every 10 minutes, it felt like they were bringing in someone else who had been hit by a pellet.""
A worker at the hospital's cafe said she had seen ""70 people with eye injuries come in during a single shift"", according to Parham.
Sina - who still has pellets stuck behind one of his eyes and in his forehead - said they had been scared of being arrested at the first hospital because of the need to give their ID numbers, so they had gone to a private eye hospital.
He said he was ""lucky"" compared to the others who he saw at the eye hospital, who had ""pellets all over their faces and in both of their eyes"".
The BBC has seen a medical document in Sina's name that says ""there is a 5mm metallic foreign body"" behind his eye.
The medical records of a number of other protesters with pellet-gun wounds have also been received and verified by the BBC.
Protesters and activists have also described a pattern of refusal by the authorities to hand over the bodies of those killed to their families.
Mehdi said his friend's cousin was killed and that the family was told by officials to either pay a large sum of money to receive his body or agree to him being recorded as a member of the security forces.
""They said, 'Either pay 1 billion tomans [more than $7,000; £5,000] for us to hand over the body to the family, or you have to say he was a member of the Basij and was martyred for public security and against the riots.'""
Navid, a 38-year-old from Isfahan, also said two close friends whose relatives were killed had received such an ultimatum.
""They say you have to pay the equivalent of several thousand dollars or let us issue them a Basij card so they are counted among the security forces' dead,"" he cited his friends as saying.
Human rights groups have warned that this practice has served both to punish protesters' families and obscure the true death toll.

New Iran videos show bodies piled in hospital and snipers on roofs,2026-01-26T21:34:40.243Z," Merlyn Thomas

BBC Verify
","Verified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.
BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.
Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.
Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by ""rioters"".
The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.
They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.
Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.
Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream.
Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.
We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.
In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.
Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.
For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).
More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.

Israel says it has retrieved remains of final Gaza hostage,2026-01-26T18:37:05.639Z," Dan Johnson
JerusalemandRaffi Berg
","The Israeli military says it has retrieved the body of the last hostage in Gaza, paving the way for the next phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan to get under way.
It had been searching for Master Sgt Ran Gvili since the ceasefire with Hamas began in October.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Gvili's return ""an extraordinary achievement"".
The Israeli military began searching a cemetery for Gvili on Sunday morning. Hamas's armed wing said it had provided mediators with ""all the details and information"" about Gvili's location.
Netanyahu's office said Israel would reopen Gaza's key border crossing with Egypt once the operation to find and return Gvili was complete.
The prime minister hailed the return of Gvili's body, saying: ""We promised - and I promised - to bring everyone back. We brought them all back, down to the very last captive,"" he said.
The Israeli military said the clarification of existing intelligence over the weekend had enabled the search of the cemetery near Gaza City. A military official said the cemetery ""was located in the area of the Yellow Line"", the boundary to territory still controlled by Israeli forces under the ceasefire deal.
Hamas said it had ""kept updating the mediators with the necessary information, which resulted in retrieving the body"".
Spokesman Hazem Qassem said the discovery ""confirms Hamas's commitment to all the requirements of the ceasefire agreement"".
In Israel, Itzik Gvili, the hostage's father, paid an emotional goodbye to his son in front of his coffin.
""You had the option to stay home, but you said to me: 'Father, I'm not going to leave my friends to fight alone.'
""You came out, and you need to see the honour you have here, all the people who brought you. All the police are here with you, the entire army is here with you, the entire nation is here with you. I'm proud of you, my son,"" Itzik Gvili said.
Rani Gvili's sister Shira earlier told the Hostages and Missing Families Forum: ""I feel an insane sense of relief. I feel relieved. I am sad. I'm very sad that it ended this way, but it had to end at some point. I am so happy he's coming back home.""
The retrieval of Gvili may bring closure to his family and it finally ends Israel's hostage agony after 843 days.
It also opens the way for further progress in Gaza's ceasefire deal. Israel had resisted moving forward until Gvili was found.
Phase two is meant to involve the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups. The plan is also meant to see the deployment of an as-yet unconstituted International Stabilization Force (ISF) and the progressive withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
On Friday, the Gvili family gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, as they had every week since he and the other 250 were abducted on 7 October 2023.
""I looked them in the eyes and said: 'We will bring Rani home',"" Netanyahu recounted on Monday. ""I promised you, citizens of Israel: We will bring everyone home.""
It is a promise finally delivered, and will be celebrated, but his critics say it has taken too long and cost too many lives - Israeli and Palestinian.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Gvili's retrieval in a statement, saying: ""According to the information and intelligence available to us, Sgt Maj (res) Ran Gvili... a Yamam commando fighter, aged 24 at the time of his death, fell in battle on the morning of October 7, 2023, and his body was abducted to the Gaza Strip.
""The IDF shares in the family's grief. The IDF will continue to accompany the families and the returned hostages and to act to strengthen the security of Israel's citizens.
""With this, all of the hostages from the Gaza Strip area have been returned.""
Netanyahu said he sent soldiers into Gaza to return the hostages and defeat Hamas.
Opening the Rafah border crossing is an important next step but other difficult issues have to be confronted.
How will Hamas be disarmed and unpicked from the fabric of Gaza? When will Israel's army withdraw? And who will make up the international force delivering security for the future?
This is the first time since 2014 there are no Israeli hostages, alive or dead, being held in Gaza - a reminder of the deep roots of this conflict and how difficult it could still be to shape a lasting peace.
Reacting to the return of Gvili's body, Trump posted on Truth Social: ""Just recovered the last Hostage body in GAZA. Thus, got back ALL 20 of the living Hostages, and ALL of the Dead! AMAZING JOB!""
The president said ""most thought of it as an impossible thing to do"" and congratulated his ""great team of Champions"".
Hamas was meant to return all hostages, alive and dead, within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect. The process took far longer, but eventually 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 27 dead Israeli and foreign hostages were handed over, leaving only Gvili missing.
The policeman was one of 251 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed. Most of the hostages were released alive over the course of the next two years in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.
Israel's military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, has killed 71,660 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry has said.

Israel court hears appeal over ban on independent media access to Gaza,2026-01-26T15:22:28.715Z," Yolande Knell
Middle East correspondent
Jerusalem
","Israel's Supreme Court has been hearing a case brought by foreign journalists asking for the Israeli government to end its ban on independent media access to the Gaza Strip.
Despite the ceasefire in Gaza which came into effect last October, the Israeli government has refused to change the policy it introduced two years ago at the start of the war, citing security concerns.
The lawyer for the Foreign Press Association (FPA), Gilad Sher, told the court that the situation was ""absurd"", undermining the principles of press freedom and the public's right to know.
The lawyer representing the government, Yonathan Nadav, said that unrestricted media access would endanger Israeli troops and journalists.
It is not clear when the Supreme Court will issue its decisive ruling.
The FPA represents some 400 journalists based in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories working for the international media. These include locally based journalists working for the BBC.
During the deadliest ever war in Gaza, the foreign media have only been allowed to enter the territory on limited, restricted visits, accompanied by the Israeli military. Some of my BBC colleagues have taken part in these so-called military embeds.
Almost all on-the-ground reporting and filming has been done by Palestinian journalists who were already in Gaza and have themselves been living through harsh conditions.
Since the departure of our long-time BBC staff members during the war, we have relied on a small team of trusted freelancers to help us with our work.
The FPA has been pressing the Israeli government for journalists to be allowed to enter Gaza since early in the war. In 2024, it issued a petition, after which the Supreme Court granted the government several extensions to submit its response.
Finally, the court set 4 January as a final deadline for the authorities. In its submission, the government maintained that the ban should remain in place on security grounds.
""Now we have a ceasefire, we're saying it's rather difficult to understand these security arguments,"" FPA chairperson and Deutsche Welle Jerusalem correspondent Tania Kraemer told me at the Supreme Court.
""We want to go into Gaza. It's our job to be there to talk to people. And that's what we do the best - to be there doing first-hand reporting.""
The FPA has stressed that its demand for independent access does not detract from the work of Palestinian colleagues based in Gaza.
""They have been displaced, they have taken risks, many journalists have been killed - we all know the numbers,"" Kraemer added.
""We are saying they should not have to bear this burden alone and that we should be able to basically report alongside them.""
In previous times of war, the FPA has succeeded in pressing the Israeli government to allow access for journalists. This happened in early 2009, after some media teams had already managed to enter the strip from Egypt via the Rafah crossing.
During the six-week conflict between Israel and Hamas in 2014, I was among the journalists who signed a legal waiver so that the Israeli military would allow me to enter the Palestinian territory at a time of active hostilities.
At that time, the BBC routinely shared the location of its office in Gaza City and hotels where we stayed with the Israeli military. We kept its press desk informed as we moved around in our armoured car and the FPA was able to co-ordinate buses to bring us in and out of the territory via Israel's Erez crossing.
Such efforts reduced - but did not totally prevent - dangerous encounters with Israeli troops and Hamas fighters.
According to media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders, more than 220 Palestinian journalists have been killed since the start of the Gaza war, including at least 68 killed while working.
The Israeli military says it only targets members of armed Palestinian groups and military sites.
A week ago, an Israeli strike south of Gaza City killed three freelance journalists who worked with international news agencies while they were filming: Mohammed Qashta, Anas Ghneim and Abdul Raouf Shaat.
The military said it attacked ""several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas... in a manner that posed a threat"" to its forces and that the incident was under examination.
Both Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists, another NGO, have filed briefs with the Israeli court to grant media access immediately. They have argued that keeping journalists out of Gaza sets a ""dangerous precedent"".

'I saw people getting shot': Eyewitness tells of Iran protest crackdown,2026-01-23T15:33:01.114Z," Soroush Pakzad
","Warning: This story contains details which some readers might find distressing.
An Iranian woman who witnessed the bloody crackdown on protests in Iran has described how her neighbourhood turned into a ""war zone"" as security forces opened fire at crowds with live ammunition.
A government-imposed internet blackout in Iran, now in its third week, has prevented many accounts of what has happened from reaching the wider world.
But some Iranians who have left the country have been able to share what they have seen.
Parnia, who lives in London, told the BBC that she was visiting her family in the central city of Isfahan when the protests broke out in the capital, Tehran. They quickly spread across the country, and within days there were hundreds of protesters in the Hakim Nezami and Khaghani neighbourhoods of Isfahan.
""There were women and men from seven to 70 years old,"" she said. ""On just one street there were 200 to 300 people. People were chanting 'Death to the dictator' and 'Long live the shah'."" The ""dictator"" was Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran's late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.
Isfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency.
First, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said. Then they formed a line and fired birdshot.
""I saw people getting shot and falling down, and I saw blood on the street.""
Parnia said she ran away down alleyways and was suddenly pulled into an apartment block by a woman. Inside, she said, were many injured protesters.
""I saw the lobby floor covered in blood, and I saw a girl whose leg was full of pellets.""
Videos verified by the BBC from that night show large numbers of people in the streets in Isfahan. Some streets were blocked by traffic sign poles and large metal sheets, in an apparent effort by protesters to protect themselves from gunfire.
Footage also showed protesters breaking through the gates of the building of the national broadcaster Irib, which was later set on fire.
On Friday morning, 9 January, Khamenei said Iran would not back down from dealing with what he called ""destructive elements"", a day after US President Donald Trump had threatened to hit Iran ""very hard"" if authorities started killing people.
Following Khamenei's speech, the powerful Revolutionary Guards sent a text message to people across Iran, telling them to avoid gatherings on streets in areas of unrest. The messages also warned against co-operating with what it described as ""terrorist mercenaries"" - an act it said would constitute treason.
Despite the risks, Parnia went out to protest again on Friday evening.
""The protesters were hopeful,"" she said. ""You could see fear on everyone's faces. We were afraid to pass in front of the security forces and come closer together,"" she said.
""We thought even if we get killed, it would be a reason for Trump to act faster.""
Footage obtained by the BBC from the previous day shows large crowds on main streets in Parnia's neighbourhood. But she said on the Friday it was different.
""Protesters were in small groups gathered in alleyways. Every time that someone tried to gather in the larger street, we could hear live fire sound followed by screams and shouts.""
Because of the internet blackouts, and protesters avoiding taking their phones with them, the BBC has not yet obtained footage from Friday night.
Parnia also described a scene of ""total chaos"" at a local clinic that was treating wounded protesters.
""No phone lines were working. Nobody could call their families, and many refused to go to hospitals, fearing they could be arrested there,"" she said.
""All the nurses could do was clean the wounds and send them home. The next day you could still smell the tear gasses in the air. Security forces were present and there were checkpoints across the city.""
Parnia left Isfahan that same day and travelled to the capital, Tehran, to catch a flight back to London.
""I arrived in Tehran at 6pm. All the shops were closed and many people gathered in the streets. At 8pm everyone started to chant and I could hear gunshots,"" she said.
""The airport was so busy. Many foreign airlines were cancelled and people were frustrated. Luckily, I found an Iranian flight to leave.""
Since her return to the UK, Parnia has been in touch with her friends in Isfahan.
She said she learned from a source that doctors at Feiz eye hospital in Isfahan had carried out around 300 surgical procedures to remove the eyes of patients with birdshot-related facial injuries.
""Every time you go out into the streets, you see random people with eye patches,"" Parnia's friends told her.
According to several health workers who spoke to the BBC, hospitals are monitored and controlled by security forces, and people with gunshot wounds in Isfahan are being arrested.
""Many of the injured are developing infections. Some doctors are referring them to surgeons who can treat them in private clinics,"" Parnia's cited her friends as saying.
While Iranian authorities have said around 3,000 people were killed during the protests, US-based human rights group HRANA has so far confirmed more than 4,600 deaths, with another 9,700 cases still under review. According to the group, at least 7,300 people have also sustained serious injuries. Many believe the true figures may be even higher.
Parnia said she was now preparing to join Iranian opposition protests in the UK, saying she wants to be a voice for the silenced protesters.
She also expressed anger at international media reports suggesting that Iranians and the country's political opposition was not united.
""Iranians have shown what they want in the streets and paid a high price for it.""

'I didn't hear from my son for seven months': Inside Yemen's UAE-run secret prisons,2026-01-23T14:43:48.236Z," Nawal Al-Maghafi
Senior international investigations correspondent
Yemen
","The BBC has been given access to detention facilities on former United Arab Emirates military bases in Yemen, confirming long-standing allegations of a network of secret prisons run by the UAE and forces allied to it in Yemen's decade-long civil war.
One former detainee told the BBC he had been beaten and sexually abused at one of the sites.
We saw cells at two bases in the south of the country, including shipping containers with names - apparently of detainees - and dates scratched into the sides.
The UAE did not respond to our request for comment, but has previously denied similar allegations.
Until recently, the Yemeni government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, was allied with the UAE against the Houthi rebel movement which controls north-west Yemen.
But the alliance between Yemen's two Gulf state partners has fractured. UAE forces pulled out of Yemen in early January and Yemeni government forces and groups allied to them have retaken large swathes of the south from separatists backed by the UAE.
This includes the port of Mukalla, where we landed in a Saudi military plane and were taken to visit the former UAE military bases in the Al-Dhaba Oil Export Area.
It has been almost impossible for international journalists to get visas to report from Yemen in recent years, but the government invited reporters to view the two sites, accompanied by Yemen's Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani.
What we saw was consistent with accounts we have gathered independently, both in our previous reporting and also interviews conducted in Yemen, separately from the government-run site visit.
At one site, there were about 10 shipping containers, their interiors painted black, with little ventilation.
Messages on the walls appeared to mark the dates detainees said they were brought in, or to count the number of days they had been held.
Several were dated as recently as December 2025.
At another military base, the BBC was shown eight cells built from brick and cement, including several measuring about one metre square and two metres tall, which Eryani said were used for solitary confinement.
Human rights groups have documented testimony describing such facilities for years.
Yemeni lawyer Huda al-Sarari has been gathering accounts.
The BBC independently attended a meeting she organised, where about 70 people were present who said they had been held in Mukalla, as well as the families of another 30 who they said their relatives were still in detention.
Several former detainees told us that each shipping container could hold up to 60 men at a time.
They said prisoners were blindfolded, bound at the wrists and forced to remain sitting upright at all hours.
""There was no space to lie down,"" one former prisoner told the BBC. ""If someone collapsed, the others had to hold him up.""
The man also told the BBC he was beaten for three days after his arrest, with interrogators demanding he confess to being a member of al-Qaeda - an accusation he denies.
""They told me if I didn't admit it, I would be sent to 'Guantanamo',"" he said, referring to the US military detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
""I didn't even know what they meant by Guantanamo until they took me to their prison. Then I understood.""
He said he was held there for a year and a half, beaten daily and abused.
""They didn't even feed us properly,"" he said. ""If you wanted the toilet, they took you once. Sometimes you were so desperate you did it on yourself.""
He says his captors included Emirati soldiers as well as Yemeni fighters: ""All types of torture - when we were interrogated it was the worst. They even sexually abused us and said they would bring in the 'doctor'.
""This so-called doctor was Emirati. He beat us and told the Yemeni soldiers to beat us too. I tried to kill myself multiple times to make it end.""
The UAE was leading a counter-terror campaign in southern Yemen, but human rights groups say thousands of people were detained in crackdowns on political activists and critics.
A mother told us her son was detained as a teenager and has been held for nine years.
""My son was an athlete,"" she said. ""He had just come back from competing abroad. That day he went to the gym and never came back.""
""I didn't hear from him for seven months,"" she said.
""Then they let me see him for 10 minutes. I could see all the scars of the torture.""
She alleged that in the prison at the Emirati-run base, her teenage son was electrocuted, doused with ice-cold water and sexually abused multiple times.
She says she attended a hearing in which her son's accusers played a recording of him apparently confessing.
""You can hear him being beaten in the background and told what to say,"" she said. ""My son is not a terrorist. You have robbed him of the best years of his life.""
Over the past decade, human rights groups and media organisations - including the BBC and Associated Press - have documented allegations of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture in detention centres run by the UAE and its allies.
Human Rights Watch said in 2017 it had gathered testimonies of detainees held without charge or judicial oversight in unofficial facilities, and subjected to beatings, electric shocks and other forms of ill treatment.
The UAE denied these allegations when they were made.
The BBC sent detailed allegations to the UAE government about the detention sites we visited and accounts of abuse, but received no response.
All sides have been accused of human rights violations in the civil war, which has sparked a devastating humanitarian crisis in the country.
Families of detainees told the BBC they had repeatedly raised concerns with Yemeni authorities.
They believe it would have been impossible for the UAE and its allies to run a detention network without the Yemeni government and its Saudi backers knowing about it.
The information minister, Eryani, said: ""We weren't able to access locations that were under UAE control until now.
""When we liberated them we discovered these prisons… we had been told by many victims that they existed but we didn't believe it was true.""
His government's decision to give access to international media comes as the rift between Saudi Arabia and the UAE is widening.
Their long-strained relationship deteriorated in December when UAE-backed southern separatists, the Southern Transition Council (STC), seized territory controlled by government forces in two western provinces.
Saudi Arabia then carried out a strike on what it said was a shipment of weapons from the UAE to the STC in Mukalla, and backed a demand from Yemen's presidential council for Emirati forces to leave the country immediately.
The UAE withdrew and within days government forces and their allies retook control of the western provinces as well as all of the south.
However, remaining separatists threaten the government's position in some places, including the southern port of Aden.
The UAE denied that the shipment had contained weapons and also Saudi allegations that it was behind the STC's recent military campaign.
On 12 January 2026, the president of Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council, which oversees the government, Rashad al-Alimi, ordered the closure of all ""illegal"" prisons in southern provinces previously controlled by the STC, demanding the immediate release of those ""held outside the framework of the law"".
Eryani said some detainees had been discovered inside the facilities, but did not give numbers or further details.
Some relatives - including the mother of the athlete - told the BBC that detainees have since been transferred to prisons now nominally under government control.
Yemeni authorities say transferring prisoners into the formal justice system is complex, while rights groups warn arbitrary detention may simply continue under different control.
""The terrorists are out on the streets,"" the mother said.
""Our sons are not terrorists.""

UN to take over al-Hol camp for IS families in Syria after unrest,2026-01-22T22:46:15.475Z," Rachel Hagan
","The United Nations (UN) says it will take over management of a camp in north-eastern Syria holding thousands of people with alleged links to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS).
It comes after Kurdish-led forces that had been running the camp withdrew in the face of an advance by Syrian government forces, triggering unrest that forced aid agencies to suspend operations.
Residents were reported to have rushed camp perimeters in an apparent attempt to escape, prompting unrest and looting.
A ceasefire agreement has brought much of Syria's north-east under the control of Damascus, ending years of autonomous Kurdish rule.
Briefing the UN Security Council on Thursday, UN official Edem Wosornu said the UN refugee agency UNHCR had ""taken over camp management responsibilities"" at al-Hol and was working with Syrian authorities to restore humanitarian access. Syrian forces, she said, had established a security perimeter around the camp.
However, UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric cautioned that conditions inside remained ""tense and volatile"", with humanitarian operations still suspended following the violence.
Meanwhile, the US has launched a parallel effort to remove high-risk detainees from the region altogether. US Central Command said on Wednesday that it had begun transferring up to 7,000 suspected IS fighters from prisons in northeast Syria to Iraq, confirming that 150 detainees had already been moved to a ""secure location"" across the border.
Iraqi authorities said all transferred detainees would be prosecuted under Iraqi law.
""This is a measure aimed at protecting regional and international security from an imminent threat. Nevertheless, we stress that this issue should not be left to become a long-term strategic burden on Iraq alone,"" Iraq's deputy UN ambassador, Mohammed Sahib Mejid Marzooq, said.
Syria's UN ambassador Ibrahim Olabi said the Syrian government welcomed the US operation to transfer IS detainees out of Syrian territory and was ready to offer support.
Rights groups have warned that the transfers could expose detainees to serious abuses.
The Reprieve charity said it believed up to ten British men could be among those transferred, along with juvenile detainees and urged the UK government to intervene urgently. Around 55 to 60 British nationals, most of them children, remain detained across camps and prisons in the region, it said.
""The prisoners transferred face being tortured, sentenced to death and executed, without being granted any meaningful opportunity to contest the allegations against them"", Katherine Cornett, Reprieve's deputy director told the BBC.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), US and UN have long called for the repatriation of foreign IS suspects and their families from north-eastern Syria, citing the political instability and dire conditions in the prisons and camps, but many countries have refused to take them.

Rapid rollback of Kurdish-led forces reshapes Sharaa's Syria,2026-01-22T12:08:12.194Z," Hugo Bachega

","President Ahmed al-Sharaa has made significant advances in his efforts to unify a deeply fractured Syria, reclaiming large swathes of territory in the north-east that had been under the control of a Kurdish-led militia alliance for more than a decade. What happens next will be a test for a government that has tried to assert its authority over the whole country.
The gains by government forces in a lightning offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) marked the biggest change of control in Syria since Islamist-led rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending the 13-year civil war. Before this month's push, nearly a third of Syria's territory was controlled by the Kurds, who enjoyed American support after helping a US-led coalition defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in the last decade. There, they ran an enclave with its own government and institutions, with the SDF being its military arm.
The offensive came amid stalled talks between Sharaa's government and the SDF about the key issue of integrating its forces into the country's institutions. A deal was signed last March, but a year-end deadline expired with little progress as the SDF remained reluctant to give up its autonomy. The militia alliance, analysts say, miscalculated in its negotiations with the government, seeming to believe it would have the backing of its longtime ally.
But the US under President Donald Trump has strongly supported Sharaa, who has defended his vision of a united Syria under the control of Damascus. Trump hosted Sharaa, who was once branded a terrorist by the US for his former links to al-Qaeda, at the White House last year, and lifted devastating sanctions imposed on Syria in the Assad years. When Sharaa's forces started their push, there was no apparent US objection.
On Sunday, after suffering stunning territorial losses, the SDF agreed on a 14-point deal that reversed almost all concessions it had gained from the government in earlier negotiations. Crucially, its members are expected to join the Syrian army and interior ministry as individuals - and not as separate units, as it had demanded - while the control of oil and gas fields, important for Syria's economic recovery, will be transferred to the government. SDF-run prisons and camps holding thousands of IS detainees and family members are also being brought under Damascus' control.
The announcement came days after Sharaa issued a decree that was seen as an attempt to reach out to the Kurds, whose rights had been denied in the five-decade rule by the Assads: it designated Kurdish as a national language, granted Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declared the Nowruz - the Persian new year - a national holiday.
Fighting, however, erupted again. So far, the areas reclaimed by government forces have been mainly Arab, where locals had resentments against the SDF. But the troops continued to move towards Kurdish-majority areas, raising the prospect of deadly clashes, and reportedly angering Washington. On Tuesday, Sharaa's government suddenly announced a ceasefire, giving the SDF four days to present a detailed plan for the integration of areas under its control into the state. This halted the move of his army and prevented the escalation of the violence, for now.
Since coming to power after the fall of the Assad regime, Sharaa has repeatedly vowed to protect Syria's minorities. But the country has seen deadly bouts of sectarian violence. Last year, government forces were accused of atrocities after being sent to the Mediterranean coast, which is the heartland of Assad's Alawite sect, and the mainly Druze southern province of Suweida. Kurds fear the same could happen to them, despite renewed guarantees offered by Sharaa.
For the Kurds, the losses are a fatal blow to the aspirations of preserving their autonomy, with the US position being seen as a betrayal. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy, said the ""original purpose"" of the partnership with the SDF, as the main anti-IS force in Syria, had ""largely expired"", and that the ""greatest opportunity for the Kurds in Syria"" lay in the transition under Sharaa, whose government is seen by Western countries as the best chance to guarantee Syria's stability.
The dramatic changes empower Sharaa but are likely to renew calls for him to decentralise authority, with critics saying key posts have been limited to his allies. It could also indicate what he may be planning to do in other areas of the country, including those held by the Druze, who demand autonomy.

"Israeli strike in Gaza kills three journalists, first responders say",2026-01-21T20:44:23.755Z," David GrittenandDan Johnson
Jerusalem
","Three Palestinian journalists have been killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza, first responders say.
Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said their car was hit in the al-Zahra area and named them as Mohammed Salah Qashta, Anas Ghneim and Abdul Raouf Shaat. They are understood to have been working for an Egyptian relief organisation.
The Israeli military said it struck ""several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas... in a manner that posed a threat"" to its troops. It added that the incident was under examination.
Another eight people, two of them children, were killed by Israeli artillery and gunfire across Gaza on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said.
Medics said three people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli tank fire elsewhere in central Gaza, and that a 13-year-old boy and a woman were killed by Israeli gunfire in the southern Khan Younis area, according to Reuters news agency.
The Israeli military said on Wednesday morning that its troops had killed a ""terrorist who crossed the Yellow Line and approached"" them, without mentioning a location. The Yellow Line demarcates territory in Gaza still under Israeli control under the ceasefire deal.
At least 466 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on 10 October, according to the health ministry.
The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups over the same period.
The three photojournalists killed on Wednesday were reportedly working for the Egyptian Relief Committee in the Gaza Strip to film its camps for displaced people.
A spokesperson for the humanitarian organisation said the car that was struck was marked with its logo and that it was ""targeted during a humanitarian mission, resulting in the martyrdom of three individuals"".
Hamas called the strike a ""dangerous escalation of the flagrant violations of the ceasefire agreement"".
The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said it constituted a war crime and evidence of what it called ""a systematic Israeli policy aimed at silencing the Palestinian voice, obstructing the transmission of facts, and concealing crimes committed against civilians"", according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Abdul Raouf Shaat was a regular contributor to French news agency AFP, which expressed ""immense sadness"" at his death and demanded a ""full and transparent investigation"".
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) also said it was ""appalled"".
""Israel, which possesses advanced technology capable of identifying its targets, has an obligation under international law to protect journalists,"" regional director Sara Qudah said.
The CPJ has documented the killing of at least 206 journalists and media workers by Israeli fire in Gaza since the start of the war - the deadliest conflict for journalists ever documented.
Before Wednesday, two journalists had been killed in Israeli strikes during the ceasefire, and a third had been killed by members of a Palestinian armed group, according to the US-based organisation's data.
International news outlets, including the BBC, rely on local journalists in Gaza, as Israel does not allow them to send foreign journalists into the territory independently. Some journalists are taken into Gaza by the Israeli military under controlled access.
The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,550 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.

Israel postpones demolition of Palestinian children's football pitch,2026-01-21T15:34:10.814Z," John Sudworth
Jerusalem
","Israel has postponed the demolition of a Palestinian children's football club in the city of Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank.
It said the Aida Youth Centre's pitch was constructed without the necessary permits.
It said the demolition was necessary for security reasons.
An international campaign to save it, including a petition with more than half a million signatures, appears to have forced the authorities to reconsider. The club, however, said it had not yet received any official notification.
It is barely a 10th of the size of a full-scale football field, there are patches of rust on the goalposts and, towering over the length of one of the touchlines, the architecture of conflict looms large in Israel's concrete security barrier.
But while it may not rank high up among the world's iconic sporting venues, this children's football club has found itself at the centre of a hard-fought international campaign for its survival.
And despite the asymmetrical odds as it took on the Israeli state, that campaign appears - for now at least - to have worked.
The club has won a reprieve against the threat of demolition by the Israeli military, which claimed that the pitch was far too close to the barrier.
On the very northern edge of Bethlehem, construction of the pitch began in 2020 with the aim of providing a place to practise football for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp.
The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal.
The notice was followed by a demolition order, issued at the end of December.
""We don't have anywhere else to play, 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back.
""We are building our dreams here,"" she said. ""If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.""
I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction.
""I was upset,"" he told me. ""This is a field I really care for.""
The community fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures as well as the reported interventions of senior officials from some of football's global and regional governing bodies.
In its latest statement, the Israeli military repeated its claim that the football pitch, built so close to the wall, posed a security issue.
But the BBC understands that a political decision has been made to postpone the demolition order ""for the time being"".
Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis.
It says it is vital for Israel's protection and that it has dramatically cut the number of attacks.
Palestinians, however, say that it has become a tool of collective punishment, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land.
For them, the fight over the football pitch highlights a wider injustice.
While they are being denied the right to keep a small sporting facility on the boundary of one of their cities, Israel is approving vast new settlements across the occupied West Bank and which are considered illegal under international law.
The immediate threat may now have been averted for the football pitch.
But the club is taking nothing for granted.
Mohammad Abu Srour, one of the board members of the Aida Youth Centre, told me that they feared that the threat might come back when the club is out of the spotlight.
""We're going to continue to campaign,"" he told me.

Photos leaked to BBC show faces of hundreds killed in Iran's brutal protest crackdown,2026-01-21T05:56:20.140Z," Merlyn Thomas

","Warning: this story contains graphic content which some readers might find distressing
Hundreds of photos revealing the faces of those killed during Iran's violent crackdown on anti-government protests have been leaked to BBC Verify.
The pictures, which are too graphic to show without blurring, reveal the bloodied, swollen and bruised faces of at least 326 victims - including 18 women. The images, displayed in a south Tehran mortuary, are one of the only ways families have been able to identify their dead loved ones.
Many of the victims were too disfigured to be identified, and 69 people had been labelled in Persian as John or Jane Doe, suggesting their identity was unknown when the photo was taken. Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos.
Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far.
The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah.
The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state.
BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the government's violence against those who oppose it.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand people have been killed but blamed the US, Israel and those he described as ""seditionists"".
Despite the blackout entering its third week, a small number of people have managed to get some information out.
Hundreds of close-up images of victims taken from inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre were leaked to BBC Verify.
We analysed 392 photos of victims and were able to identify 326 people - some had multiple pictures taken of them from different angles. Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands.
One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. ""It was just too much,"" they said.
Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen.
The slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment.
Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming.
Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession.
BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show.
Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.
We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.
BBC Verify has tracked the spread of anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.
The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests.
The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.

"Film about Palestinian girl's desperate plea was a 'way to not feel helpless', says director",2026-01-21T00:01:05.699Z," Paul Glynn
Culture reporter
","""They're shooting at me. Please come get me. I'm scared.""
When filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania first heard the emergency phone call recording of Hind Rajab, a frightened six-year-old Palestinian girl begging for help while under siege in Gaza City in 2024, on social media, she says she immediately knew what she had to do.
Hitting pause on the movie she was about to make, the Tunisian two-time Oscar-nominee called her producer and they agreed to shift focus to telling the story of the girl, who was killed - likely by Israeli fire, according to a number of media investigations - along with her aunt, uncle and cousins, and two paramedics sent to save her.
""It haunted me,"" Ben Hania tells BBC News about the voice recording, which is the centrepiece of her Oscar-shortlisted docudrama, released in UK cinemas last Friday.
""I was really angry, I was sad, I felt helpless, and I hate it when I feel helpless.
""I asked myself this basic question, what can I do? I'm a filmmaker, so I can do movies.""
She adds: ""We started working on The Voice of Hind Rajab that way to not feel helpless, to not accept, to bear witness.
""Because not doing it, for me, was being complicit in a way.""
Hind Rajab's car was hit by suspected Israeli fire as she and her family tried to flee bombing during the two-year war in Gaza.
Several family members were killed, but Hind managed to answer a callback from the helpers at the Palestinian Red Crescent Society.
The ambulance trying to reach her was also shelled, and Hind, her family, and the ambulance crew all died.
The Israel Defence Force initially stated none of its troops had been in the area where Hind and the others were killed.
But that suggestion was questioned following independent investigations by research agency Forensic Architecture, in colloboration with NGO (Non-Governmental Organisation) Earshot and journalists from Al Jazeera, which concluded that damage to both the car and the ambulance was consistent with Israeli tank fire.
The IDF later said it had ""conducted raids on terror targets"" with forces operating in neighbourhoods in Gaza City, including Tel al Hawa, from where Hind had made her emergency call.
The UN cited her case in a commission of inquiry accusing Israel of war crimes, which it denies.
An IDF spokesperson told the BBC it is still being reviewed by Israel's Fact-Finding Assessment Mechanism (FFAM).
Ben Hania's film sets out to tell the story - in Arabic and English - of what happened to Hind and her family, from the perspective of the Red Crescent volunteers at the Ramallah call centre in the occupied West Bank.
It is ""based on true events"" and ""anchored in truth"", Ben Hania says.
""At some point, with all this proof, I thought that we are done explaining"", she adds.
""Cinema can do something better, which is provoking empathy.""
The feature mixes audio of the girl's heart-rending real final phonecalls with the Red Crescent, with a visual dramatisation using actors to represent the volunteers.
They try to keep her calm and conscious as it becomes clear she is surrounded by the dead bodies of her relatives.
Critics have praised the emotional impact of the performances, while noting the problems inherent with mixing documentary with drama.
Variety's Guy Lodge said it was ""impossible not to be moved"" by the recording at the heart of the hybrid film, heard at an ""agonising distance"".
But he felt ""the ethics and execution of the concept are questionable"".
In a four-star review, The Telegraph's Robbie Collin said the feature ""transcends shock value"" and presents viewers with ""an ethical dilemma"".
""I dreaded watching this film,"" he wrote. ""Yet having now seen it, I find my mind changed, thanks largely to the philosophical diligence of Ben Hania's approach.""
The director - who received the blessing of Hind's mother, Wesam, before making the movie - says she did her best to ""respect the testimony"" of the volunteers and what they told her about that day.
She did not reach out to the other side, because, she says: ""My movie is not an investigation.
""The investigation was already done,"" she adds, with reference to aforementioned findings, as well as those made by other major news providers including the Washington Post and Sky News.
Increasingly stressed scenes play out in the film between call centre worker Omar, played by Motaz Malhees, and his boss Mahdi, played by Amer Hlehel.
Mahdi is seeking a safe route approved by the Israeli army - via intermediaries - for his paramedics to make the eight-minute journey to carry out the rescue attempt.
Omar becomes exasperated at his boss's insistence on trying to negotiate with Israel.
Actresses Saja Kilani and Clara Khoury, as fellow call centre workers Rana and Nisreen, respectively, complete the ensemble cast of actors of Palestinian origin.
We watch them hear the sound of gunfire or an explosion in the background before the phone connection is lost entirely.
""Even the actors, at some point, stop acting,"" says their director. ""They weren't performing.""
Malhees confirms this. He tells us he suffered panic attacks during filming and thought his heart was ""going to explode"" during one scene, which for him was ""like a real conversation with a child"".
""It was a hard experience, but it's worth everything to give.""
His director stresses she wanted to share with the audience what she had felt the first time she had heard the girl's call for help. ""I thought that she was almost talking to me, to save her"".
She told herself: ""I need to go back to this moment when it was possible to save her."" Before ""the war, mainly, failed her"".
In another four-star review, the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw said there is ""a reckless, ruthless kind of provocative brilliance in what Ben Hania is doing"".
He wrote: ""Is it in bad taste? Problematic? Well, in a world where directors busy themselves and us with made-up stories about made-up people, Ben Hania is at least grabbing one of the most relevant issues of our time with both hands and finding a way to thrust it under our noses.""
The main question for Ben Hania when making the film was always: ""How to make the voice of this little girl echo?"", she explains.
""Because the world don't want to hear it. It's not a comfortable thing to face.
""And for me, it was important to honour her voice and to make it resonate beyond borders.""
Worried that it would be perceived as ""niche"", the filmmakers reached out to some famous Hollywood faces - including Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara - who signed up as executive producers.
Phoenix and Mara were in attendance when the film received a record 23-minute standing ovation following its September world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, where it also won the grand jury prize.
""I was like, when will they will stop?"" recalls Ben Hania of the ""incredible reaction"".
""And actually they stopped because the theatre asked us to leave, because there was another movie!""
""There was a moment of solidarity for real,"" adds Mahlees. ""You could feel that the people are there with you. You are not alone in this world.""
Two of Ben Hania's previous films - 2024's Four Daughters about teenage sisters who joined IS, and 2021's The Man Who Sold His Skin, about a Syrian refugee who becomes a conceptual art object - were nominated for Academy Awards.
Her Golden Globe-nominated latest film is expected to get an Oscar nomination on Thursday, for best international feature, which the director hopes would help the whole world to remember the name Hind Rajab - as the process of trying to find a lasting peace in Gaza continues.
""We don't have stars, it's not a feel-good movie,"" says Ben Hania.
""I think it's important to not look away, because this is not a story: this is history in the making.""
The Voice of Hind Rajab is out in UK cinemas now.

New ceasefire in Syria after Kurdish-led forces pull out of camp for IS families,2026-01-20T19:12:56.743Z," David Gritten
","Syria's government has announced a new ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), after the militia alliance withdrew from a camp holding thousands of people with alleged links to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS).
The SDF said its forces were ""compelled"" to leave al-Hol camp and redeploy to other cities in north-east Syria ""due to the international indifference toward the issue of [IS]"".
Syria's interior ministry complained that it took place without co-ordination with the government or US-led coalition against IS.
Later, the presidency said it had reached an ""understanding"" with the SDF on the future of Hassakeh province, which has a large Kurdish population.
A statement said the SDF would be given four days to carry out consultations on a detailed plan for the peaceful integration of areas under its control into the state.
The presidency also promised that government forces would not enter the cities of Hassakeh and Qamishli, or any Kurdish villages.
At the same time, the SDF declared its ""full commitment to the ceasefire"" and said its forces would not initiate any military action unless they were attacked.
The SDF also said it was ready to ""move forward with implementing"" the deal reached with the government on Sunday that was supposed to end almost two weeks of fighting.
The agreement should see the Kurdish-run autonomous region in the country's north-east and its key infrastructure brought under government control, as well as the integration of the tens of thousands of SDF fighters into the defence and interior ministries' forces.
It represents a major blow for the SDF, which had been reluctant to give up the autonomy that it won for Syria's Kurdish minority when helping US-led coalition forces defeat IS militarily during the country's 13-year civil war.
Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify Syria since he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, but the country remains deeply divided and has been rocked by waves of deadly sectarian violence.
The SDF announced its withdrawal from al-Hol camp as Syrian army and interior ministry forces advanced deep into Hassakeh province after taking control of Deir al-Zour and Raqqa.
""Due to the international indifference toward the issue of the IS terrorist organisation and the failure of the international community to assume its responsibilities in addressing this serious matter, our forces were compelled to withdraw from al-Hol camp and redeploy in the vicinity of cities in northern Syria that are facing increasing risks and threats,"" it said.
In a statement sent to Kurdish news agency Hawar, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi urged the US-led coalition - once his main ally - to ""bear its responsibilities in protecting facilities"".
""We withdrew to predominantly Kurdish areas and protecting them is a red line,"" he added.
The Syrian interior ministry said the SDF units had pulled out of al-Hol without any co-ordination in an ""attempt to pressure the government over the fight against terrorism"".
The ministry added that it was ""taking all necessary measures in co-ordination and co-operation with the international coalition to maintain security and stability"".
The defence ministry also said it was ready to assume control of the camp as well as all prisons holding suspected IS fighters in the region.
Before the fighting with the government erupted earlier this month, the SDF was holding about 8,000 suspected IS fighters at prisons in north-eastern Syria.
Around 34,000 people linked to IS were also being detained at al-Hol and another camp, Roj, the UN reported last August. The population of the camps, of which 60% were children, comprised 6,700 Iraqis, 15,500 Syrians and 8,500 citizens of other countries, including the UK.
The SDF, US and UN have long called for the repatriation of the foreign IS suspects and their families from north-eastern Syria, citing the political instability and dire conditions in the prisons and camps, but many countries have refused to take them.
Earlier, the government and SDF traded accusations over the escape of suspected IS fighters from an SDF-run prison in Shaddadi, in southern Hassakeh province.
The interior ministry said on Monday night that its special forces and army soldiers had entered the town following ""the escape of around 120 [IS] terrorists"" from the prison. Search operations by the security forces resulted in the arrest of 81 of the fugitives, it added.
The SDF said it had lost control of Shaddadi prison in the afternoon after ""Damascus-affiliated factions"" mounted a series of attacks and killed of dozens of its fighters, who it said had been attempting to ""prevent a serious security catastrophe"".
SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said around 1,500 IS members had escaped during the clashes, according to Reuters news agency.
The SDF also accused government forces of attacking al-Aqtan prison, north of the city of Raqqa, which is holding IS members and leaders.
On Tuesday, a statement said the prison's buildings and facilities had been shelled and its water supply cut off. ""These practices constitute a blatant violation of humanitarian standards and pose a serious threat to the lives of the detainees,"" it warned.
However, the defence ministry denied that there had been clashes in the vicinity of the prison.
It said the facility was ""fully secured"", with military police and internal security forces deployed around the facility and in contact with the administration to ensure supplies were provided.
The US, which was once the SDF's main ally in Syria, was monitoring developments in Syria with ""grave concern"", a White House official said.
""We urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint, avoid actions that could further escalate tensions, and prioritize the protection of civilians across all minority groups,"" they added.
Special envoy Tom Barrack meanwhile explained that the rationale for the US-SDF partnership had ""largely expired"", and that his country was currently focused on ensuring the security of facilities holding IS prisoners and facilitating talks between the SDF and President Sharaa's government on implementation of the ceasefire deal.
""This moment offers a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation - long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime,"" he wrote on X.
After signing the deal with the SDF on Sunday, Sharaa said he hoped it would allow Syria to ""end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress"". However, Abdi said the fighting had been ""imposed on us"" and that he had accepted the deal ""to stop the bloodshed"".

Israeli authorities demolish UN compound in occupied East Jerusalem,2026-01-20T18:51:13.839Z," John Sudworth
East Jerusalem
","Israeli demolition teams, accompanied by police, have begun tearing down the headquarters of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, in occupied East Jerusalem.
Israel says it owns the land on which the compound stands and accuses Unrwa - the organisation that provides aid, education and healthcare to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza - of being infiltrated by Hamas.
The agency has denied the allegations and says its premises are protected under international conventions.
Israel's action comes in the wake of a controversial law passed in October 2024 which banned Unrwa from operating in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem.
UN Secretary General António Guterres condemned the demolition, with his spokesperson calling for the Israeli government to ""return and restore the compound"" to the United Nations ""without delay"".
On Tuesday morning, the demolition crews made quick work of the compound that has stood on this site for decades.
The heavy machines ripped into the corrugated metal roofs and tore down walls, leaving piles of tangled debris in their wake.
Israel said no UN personnel were present on site when its actions began.
Unrwa has been under increasing pressure from the Israeli authorities.
A second law, also passed in October 2024, severing all state contact with the refugee agency, had already been making itself felt.
A health clinic in East Jerusalem was recently forced to close and electricity companies had begun the process of shutting off power to a number of Unrwa properties.
But there's no doubt that this action was unexpected and unprecedented.
The head of Unrwa, Philippe Lazzarini, posted on social media calling it an ""open and deliberate defiance of international law, including of the immunities and privileges of the United Nations"".
Britain's Middle East Minister Hamish Falconer said he was ""appalled"" by reports that Israeli crews had begun demolishing a United Nations headquarters in East Jerusalem.
UN premises are protected under international treaty, making them immune from ""search, requisition, expropriation and any other form of interference"".
But Israel says that those protections have been made null and void because of its allegation that Unrwa staff were involved in the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks.
A statement from Israel's foreign ministry confirming that the demolition was taking place called the organisation a ""greenhouse for terrorism"".
The UN admits that nine Unrwa staff may have been involved on 7 October but it says Israel has not provided any evidence for its claim that the agency's been more widely infiltrated by Hamas.
Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who was on site watching the demolition, described it as marking an ""historic day"".
On the edge of compound from where journalists were filming was Aryeh King, the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, also from the far-right of Israeli politics.
He told the BBC that Unrwa was a ""Nazi"" organisation and said he ""didn't care"" what the UN had to say about international law.
Despite the demolition of its headquarters and the targeting of its other premises in East Jerusalem, Unrwa's work in the West Bank and Gaza continues.
It employs thousands of staff and has, since its founding in 1949, been providing welfare and vocational training for Palestinian refugees and their descendants in the occupied territories.
But its activities have been seriously impacted by the war in Gaza.
The UN says more than 300 Unrwa staff have been killed in Israeli strikes and the organisation also faces an acute funding crisis, prompted in part by the Israeli allegations of complicity. Hundreds of staff have been laid off in recent weeks.
Israel, though, is doubling down, saying the ""possession and evacuation"" of other Unrwa buildings will follow.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has already threatened to take Israel to the International Court of Justice over its laws targeting Unrwa and its assets.
The demolition marks a significant widening of the rift.
Correction 9 February 2026: This article originally said that the law banning Unrwa from operating in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem was passed last year. It was passed in October 2024, as we reported at the time, and the article has been amended accordingly. We have also made clear that a second bill severing all state contact with Unrwa was passed on the same day as the first bill, as we reported at the time.

Palestinian children's football pitch faces Israeli demolition ultimatum,2026-01-20T07:23:51.268Z," John Sudworth
Bethlehem
","A Palestinian children's football club in the occupied West Bank faces imminent demolition despite an international campaign to save it. Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players.
But Israel insists it's been built without the necessary permits.
In this deeply divided land so much is contested; from the identities and faiths of the people who live here, to every inch of the ground they stand on.
Recently, that has come to include one small patch of artificial turf laid down under the shadow of the giant concrete wall that isolates Israel from much of the occupied West Bank.
In the context of the 7 October attacks, the two-year war in Gaza and the fragility of the current ceasefire, there are without doubt far more pressing issues.
But this is a story freighted with symbolism and one which has drawn outsized international attention because of its connection to that other world religion - football.
On the day we visit, a group of Palestinian children are lining up to take penalty shots in the winter sunshine.
The construction of the pitch began here on the edge of Bethlehem in 2020, and today it provides a place to practise for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp.
The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.
On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal.
The notice was followed soon by a demolition order.
""We don't have anywhere else to play,"" 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back.
""We are building our dreams here,"" she said. ""If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.""
I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction.
""I was upset,"" he told me. ""This is a field I really care for.""
The community has fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures, and receiving messages of international support.
The club says that after representations from a lawyer it was recently given a seven-day reprieve.
But that extension expired on Monday, leaving it with a difficult choice.
As is common practice in such cases, the club owners must either demolish the pitch themselves or wait for the Israeli authorities to do it forcibly, after which they'll be presented with the bill.
The looming presence of the wall, which runs along the length of one of the touchlines, is just one of the many complex layers that underpin the Israeli occupation of the territory that Palestinians want as the basis for a future state.
Militarily, Israel exerts control over the entirety of the West Bank.
But administrative control – its day-to-day governance – is divided between a patchwork of Palestinian-run areas and Israeli-run ones.
The maps on which those distinctions are based were drawn up as a key part of the Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).
The West Bank was split into three categories of territory.
Areas A and B were pockets of land over which the Palestinian Authority was given civil control.
In those marked as Area A, Palestinians were also given nominal security control.
Area C – more than 60% of the total – was to remain temporarily under full Israeli control.
The idea was that it would eventually be gradually transferred to Palestinian self-rule as the negotiations continued.
While that never happened, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the peace process, the maps remain the basis for much of how the West Bank is governed today.
Bethlehem itself is designated as Area A.
But the maps show Israel exercising Area C civil authority over much of the surrounding countryside, right up the city's edge.
Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis.
Critics claim that today, as it has grown in length, the wall has become a tool for punishing many thousands of ordinary Palestinians, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land.
But what's now in contention in Bethlehem is a tiny, narrow patch of ground on the Palestinian side of the wall.
For the residents of the Aida camp looking for space to build a football field, it was just large enough to accommodate their needs.
But for Israel it remains – and is marked on the maps – as part of Area C, even though the construction of the wall has left it marooned on the Bethlehem side.
Satellite photos show that the space was vacant in 2019 and then, year by year, the pitch can be seen beginning to take shape, fitting in snuggly right up against the wall.
The demolition order argues that it was built without the necessary permissions on a plot of land over which Israel still asserts full civil control.
For Palestinians, there is no small irony in the fact that they're being denied the right to build a small football pitch on the boundary of their city, inside the wall that fences them in.
While turning down permission for their buildings and demolishing existing ones, Israel continues to approve the construction of vast new Israeli settlements across Area C, which are considered illegal under international law.
Last September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed an agreement to push ahead with a major and highly controversial settlement that will house 20,000 Israelis.
Located between occupied East Jerusalem and the already existing settlement of Maale Adumim, if completed it would effectively cut the West Bank in half which, Palestinians say, will all but destroy their aspirations for nationhood.
The Israeli government agrees.
""There will be no Palestinian state,"" Netanyahu said at the signing ceremony. ""This place belongs to us.""
Some of his ministers speak openly of the full annexation of the West Bank.
In Bethlehem, the football club – which claims it did receive verbal permission in 2020 for the pitch – believes the threat of demolition is about far more than planning law.
""The Israelis don't want us to have any kind of hope, they don't want us to have any opportunity,"" Mohammad Abu Srour, one of the board members of the Aida Youth Centre, told me.
The idea, he suggested, was to make life deliberately hard.
""The moment that we lose hope and opportunity we are going to leave. This is the only explanation for us.""
We approached the Israeli body that manages civilian affairs in the West Bank for comment.
Although the demolition order was issued on its behalf, we were referred instead to the Israeli military, which oversees its work.
The IDF gave us the following statement.
""Along the security fence, there is a confiscation order and a prohibition on construction; therefore, the construction in the area was carried out unlawfully,"" it said.
As they wait to see what happens next, the children of Aida hope that the international attention might be enough to sway the authorities' minds.
But for now, as the wider conflict grinds on, the future of one small football pitch is hanging in the balance.

Clashes reported after Syria and Kurdish-led forces agree ceasefire,2026-01-19T20:59:10.300Z," David GrittenandRachel Hagan
","Syria's army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance have reported fresh clashes in the country's north-east, a day after a ceasefire deal brought much of the autonomous region under government control.
The 14-point agreement signed on Sunday, which will see the SDF withdraw from Raqqa and Deir al-Zour provinces and then be integrated into state institutions, was supposed to end almost two weeks of fighting.
President Ahmed al-Sharaa said he hoped it would allow Syria to ""end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress"".
SDF commander Mazlum Abdi said the fighting had been ""imposed on us"" and that he had accepted the deal ""to stop the bloodshed"".
Abdi added that he would explain the terms after returning from Damascus, where he was expected to fly on Monday for talks on implementation.
It appears to be a major blow for the SDF, which had been reluctant to give up the autonomy it won for Syria's Kurdish minority when helping US-led forces defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) during the country's 13-year civil war.
Sharaa has vowed to reunify Syria since he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, but the country remains deeply divided and has been rocked by several waves of deadly sectarian violence.
On Monday, Syrian government forces advanced deep into northern and eastern areas previously controlled by the SDF.
In the afternoon, the army announced that it had entered Shaddadi, in Hassakeh province, following what it alleged was the SDF's decision to release a number of detained IS members from the town's prison, according to state news agency Sana.
The army said it had contacted mediators and the SDF to discuss an organised handover of the prison, but that the SDF's leadership had ""refused"". Soldiers would not take the necessary measures to restore security and apprehend the escapees, it added.
The SDF said Shaddadi prison had ""fallen outside the control of our forces"" following repeated attacks by ""factions affiliated with Damascus"" since the early hours of the day. Dozens of SDF fighters had been killed as they tried ""to prevent a serious security catastrophe"", it added.
The SDF also reported that clashes were continuing around another prison holding IS members, al-Aqtan in Raqqa, where it said nine of its fighters had been killed.
Earlier, the army said three soldiers had been killed in two attacks by ""terrorist groups"" in the north-eastern Jazira region. It alleged that members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades and has a long-running association with the SDF, were attempting to disrupt the ceasefire and ""remnants of the former regime"".
The interior ministry also said its forces had begun deploying to Deir al-Zour province as ""part of a broader security plan aimed at protecting civilians and property"".
Dozens of government military vehicles were seen crossing a bridge to the eastern bank of the River Euphrates along with cars, lorries and motorcycles.
Safia Keddo, a 49-year-old teacher who was making her way on foot, told AFP news agency: ""The past few years have been very difficult... Today we must turn the page"".
""We want children to return to school without fear, and for electricity, water, and bread to be restored. We're not asking for a miracle; we just want stability and a normal life.""
On Sunday evening, the government and SDF agreed an immediate ceasefire on all fronts across the country, which the president hailed as a ""victory for all Syrians"".
""The Syrian state is unified and centralised in decision-making, and its institutions will enter all Syrian territories and manage all regional affairs,"" Sharaa told a news conference, according to Sana. ""In areas with special characteristics, security personnel will be appointed from local residents.""
He also urged Arab tribes living in Raqqa and Deir al-Zour to ""maintain calm and allow the implementation of the agreement"".
Before he left for Damascus, the SDF's commander said it had accepted a ceasefire agreement following an ""intense war"" in which many of its fighters had been killed or wounded since 6 January.
""This war was imposed on us. We wanted to prevent it, but unfortunately, because it was planned by many forces, it was imposed on us,"" Abdi said in a statement on Kurdish TV.
According to Sana, the deal stipulates that the SDF will immediately hand over administrative and military control of Deir al-Zour and Raqqa provinces to the government, including all civilian institutions and facilities.
It says the government will take control of all border crossings, oil and gas fields, and prisons and camps where captured IS fighters and their family members and other affiliated civilians are detained.
It also says that the SDF's military and security forces will withdraw to Hassakeh province, where they will be fully integrated into the ministries of defence and interior ""on an 'individual' basis"" - not as separate Kurdish units, as the SDF had demanded.
The agreement also welcomes a decree issued by the president on Friday which recognised Syrian Kurds as an ""integral and original"" component of the Syrian people.
The decree affirmed their cultural, linguistic and civil rights, including designating Kurdish as a national language, which will allow its teaching at schools in Kurdish-majority areas, granting Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declaring the Nowruz spring festival as a paid national holiday.
The agreement also commits the SDF to expelling all non-Syrian members of the PKK and reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against IS.
US special envoy Tom Barrack said the deal represented ""a pivotal inflection point, where former adversaries embrace partnership over division"".
""The challenging work of finalising the details of a comprehensive integration agreement begins now, and the United States stands firmly behind this process at every stage - as we safeguard our vital national security interests in defeating [IS] remnants and advance President Trump's bold Middle East Peace Plan,"" he added.
The agreement followed months of stalled negotiations over a March 2025 integration deal, which both sides had accused each other of trying to derail.
Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.

Two babies die in incident at unlicensed Jerusalem daycare centre,2026-01-19T16:20:23.713Z," David Gritten
","At least two babies have died and more than 50 other babies and toddlers are being treated at Israeli hospitals after they fell ill at an unlicensed day care centre in West Jerusalem.
The three-month-old and the other about six months old were pronounced dead at Hadassah Mount Scopus hospital and Shaare Zedek Medical Centre after medics were unable to resuscitate them.
The hospitals did not specify the cause of the deaths.
Local media initially reported that one possible cause was toxic gas coming from the heating system. But the Fire and Rescue Authority said no hazardous or toxic substances had been detected.
First responders were also cited as saying conditions in the daycare were overcrowded, and one picture appeared to show an infant sleeping on a bathroom floor.
Israeli police said forensic experts were ""conducting all necessary investigative measures to locate evidence and clarify the circumstances that led to the injuries of the infants"".
""Three caregivers who were at the daycare at the time of the incident were detained for questioning,"" it added.
The private nursery was reportedly located in an apartment building in the predominantly ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Romema.
Paramedics, ambulances and fire trucks could be seen outside. Anxious parents gathered too as the news spread.
Zalmi Neufeld, a resident of Romema, told AFP news agency that he saw ""emergency personnel pulling kids out of the building"".
""I saw parents crying, a lot of kids crying, kids all over the place,"" he said. ""It was like a war zone.""
The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it had received a report on Monday afternoon about two unconscious babies at a daycare centre.
Paramedics attempted to resuscitate the two babies and evacuated them along with 53 other babies and toddlers to hospitals for further medical examinations and treatment, it added.
The director of emergency medicine at Shaare Zedek Medical Centre said the three-month-old baby was ""brought to us after undergoing advanced resuscitation efforts"" but died. ""At this stage, we still do not know exactly what the circumstances of the incident are,"" Dr Gal Pachys stressed.
Education Minister Yoav Kisch said: ""Helpless infants lost their lives in a private facility that operated without a licence and without oversight, in violation of the law.""
He added that he had instructed his ministry and other authorities to formulate a plan to shut down unlicensed daycare centres in the wake of the ""tragic incident"".

Israel pushes back on Trump's picks for executives on Gaza 'Board of Peace',2026-01-18T17:30:24.487Z," Rachel Muller-Heyndyk
","Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu has convened a meeting with his top advisers to discuss US President Donald Trump's ""Board of Peace"" for Gaza, after Israel said it was not included in talks about the makeup of one of the board's lower bodies.
The US on Saturday named the first members of the Gaza Executive Board - including Turkey's foreign minister, a Qatari official, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
Netanyahu's office has since said this was ""not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy"".
The Board of Peace is part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war and is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza.
The exact structure of the board, which will also manage Gaza's reconstruction, remains unclear and members are still being invited.
The ""Gaza Executive Board"" will be responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), according to a statement released by the White House.
A second body, the ""founding Executive Board"" - which also includes Kushner and Blair - will have a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy.
So far, the only Israeli member on the Gaza Executive Board is Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus. There are no Palestinians on either senior board.
Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: ""The Gaza Strip does not need any ""administrative committee"" to oversee its ""rehabilitation"" - it needs to be cleansed of Hamas terrorists"".
Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid called the announcement a ""diplomatic failure for Israel.""
Officials from Qatar and Turkey, which have both been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, are confirmed members of the advisory panel.
The overarching Board of Peace will be made up of world leaders, with President Trump as its chairman, the White House said.
While those members have not been announced, the leaders of the UK, Hungary, Argentina, Jordan, Turkey, India, and Egypt have reportedly been invited.
Governments have reacted cautiously to the invitations, with only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, confirming he has accepted the role.
The White House said those chosen will work to ensure ""effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza"".
The UK was seeking more clarity on the committee, a government source told the BBC.
On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that Trump was asking countries to contribute $1bn (£745m) to join the panel.
Speaking to CBS news, a US official confirmed the reports, but clarified that countries could still join on a three year membership without paying anything.
Canada's Mark Carney said that he agreed with Trump's plan on principle, but that the details - including financial ones - were still being worked through.
Speaking to reporters in Doha on Sunday, he made clear that Canada did not have ""unimpeded"" aid funds to cover the costs of membership.

Meanwhile, the United Nations warned on Saturday that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is ""far from over"".
The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter.
Olga Cherevko from the UN aid coordination office said that the delivery of tonnes of aid and the fixing of roads in the months since a ceasefire came into effect were a ""band aid"" rather than a solution.
Bitter winter weather has led to further complications, destroying buildings and making it difficult to access healthcare.
Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.

Syrian army seizes country's largest oil field from Kurdish forces,2026-01-18T13:25:03.338Z," Henri Astier
","Syrian troops fighting Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria have seized the country's largest oilfield.
The Omar facility and nearby gas fields are under army control after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) pulled back, officials and monitors say. Earlier the army captured the strategic Tabqa dam on the Euphrates river.
The push came after the SDF announced it would redeploy east of the Euphrates, following deadly clashes last week. That withdrawal followed talks with US officials.
Ongoing fighting in the area stems from the breakdown of an agreement between SDF and the government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who is seeking to integrate Kurdish bodies into Syrian institutions.
On Friday, in an apparent good-will gesture, al-Sharaa said he would make Kurdish a national language and make the Kurdish new year an official holiday. The decree is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946.
The US-backed SDF then announced its pullout east of the Euphrates river.
Kurdish forces have been controlling swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and north-east, much of it gained during the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.
Over the weekend, Syrian troops continued their eastward push. They entered the town of Tabqa on the south-western bank of the Euphrates and nearby dam on Saturday.
On Sunday, Syrian officials announced they had seized Omar, Syria's largest oil field, on the eastern side of the river. The facility has been a major source of revenue for the SDF.
This claim was supported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. It said the SDF had withdrawn from ""entire villages and towns of the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor [province]"" as well as the Omar and Tanak oil fields early on Sunday.
Meanwhile Syrian authorities accused the SDF of blowing up two bridges on the Euphrates River, including the new al-Rashid bridge in the city of Raqqa.
Last week at least 12 people were reported killed in clashes between the two sides in the northern city of Aleppo.
The latest fighting comes despite attempts by the US to broker a ceasefire. Washington has long backed the SDF, but it also supports the Syrian government.
Following the ousting of longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad in late 2024, President al-Sharaa has been seeking to integrate Kurdish military and civilian bodies into Syria's national institutions.
In March 2025, the SDF signed a deal with the government to that effect. Almost a year on, the agreement is still not implemented, with each side blaming the other.

Fears Iran's internet shutdown could lead to 'extreme digital isolation',2026-01-18T11:09:29.763Z," Joe Tidy
BBC cybersecurity correspondentandFarshad Bayan
BBC Persian
","Iran is 10 days into one of the most extreme internet shutdowns in history, with 92 million citizens cut off from all internet services and even disruption to phone and text messaging.
The Iranian government cut off services on 8 January, apparently to stifle dissent and prevent international scrutiny of a government crack down on protesters.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet was cut off in response to what he described as externally directed ""terrorist operations"".
The government has not said when internet services will return, but new reports suggest that, behind the scenes, the authorities may be making plans to restrict it permanently.
On 15 January, the news website IranWire reported that government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told journalists that international web access will not be available until at least the Iranian New Year in late March.
Internet freedom observers at FilterWatch believe the government is hastily implementing new systems and rules to cut Iran off from the international internet.
""There should be no expectation of reopening international internet access, and even afterwards, users' access to international internet will never return to its previous form,"" FilterWatch said, citing unnamed government sources.
While the BBC cannot independently verify this report or the timing of its implementation, journalists who spoke to BBC Persian also said they were told that internet access would not be restored anytime soon.
Iran has maintained a tight grip over the internet for many years, with most western social media apps and platforms blocked, as well as external news websites like BBC News.
However many people have managed to access popular apps such as Instagram using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Internet freedom campaigners at Access Now say Iran has consistently used shutdowns as a way to mask mass violence and brutal crackdowns on protesters, as seen during the nationwide internet shutdowns during the November 2019 and September 2022 protests.
A shutdown was also imposed during the Iran-Israel conflict in June 2025.
However, the current blackout has lasted longer than any previous shutdown.
In a public statement, the charity Access Now said that full restoration of internet access is imperative.
""Restricting access to these essential services not only endanger lives but embolden authorities to conceal and evade accountability for human rights abuses,"" it said.
Already there are reports that livelihoods in Iran are being badly impacted by the shutdown with e-commerce particularly affected.
As of 18 January, the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) estimates that more than 3,300 confirmed protester deaths have been recorded, with more than 4,380 cases under review. It also reports that the number of arrests has reached 24,266 across 187 cities.
The real number of people killed and detained is believed to be significantly higher, but the lack of access means the figures cannot be independently verified.
Internet monitoring project, FilterWatch, says that the latest shutdown spells the start of a more extreme ""digital isolation"" and increased surveillance on what is said, sent and viewed online.
Amir Rashidi, director of cyber security and digital rights at the Miaan Group, which runs FilterWatch, told the BBC he believes the authorities are moving towards a tiered system in which access to the global internet would no longer be automatic but subject to approval.
Access would be granted through a registration and vetting process, he expects, adding that the technical infrastructure for such a system has been in place for years.
According to FilterWatch, the plans are not being spoken about publicly, with key decisions increasingly concentrated within security bodies rather than civilian ministries.
Protecting Iran from cyber attacks - of which there have been many high profile and disruptive cases in recent years - may be another motivation for the extreme moves.
However, analysts caution that the plans may not fully materialise or could be applied unevenly due to internal power dynamics and broader economic and technical pressures.
Amir Rashidi notes that risks to internet providers, alongside users' ability to adapt or migrate to alternative platforms, could further complicate implementation.
If Iran goes ahead with the plans being reported on, it will be following similar systems in Russia and China.
China has led the world on internet control not just with enormous state censorship over online discussion but also with what people are able to access abroad.
The so-called Great Chinese Firewall blocks citizens from much of the global internet and all western apps like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube are not reachable without VPNs - but they are also becoming harder to use.
In 2019, Russia began testing for a grand plan to create a similar system dubbed Ru-net.
But unlike China, which built state control into the internet as the web spread decades ago, Russia is having to retrofit state control into complex systems.
Russia is going a step further than China and planning to switch itself off from the world wide web with a ""kill switch"", which will apparently be used at times of crisis.
The system will allow internal internet traffic and keep the country moving online but without traffic going outside or in - a digital border in effect. But it has yet to be fully tested.
If the reports are accurate, it seems that Iran is planning to a quasi combination of permanent Chinese and Russian internet control.
""In Iran there seems to be a move to isolate everyone from any electronic access, unless approved by the government,"" said computer security expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University in the UK, after reviewing the reports of Iran's plans.
He believes the Iranian regime has probably moved ahead with its longer term plans, using the current blackout as a reason to make the technical switches and orders now, whilst everything is cut off.
Amir Rashidi says the question is no longer technical, but political - arguing that whether such systems are fully implemented now depends on political will.
Starlink and other internet-from-space services, known as Low Earth Orbit (LEO), have also complicated control for Iran during the protests.
LEO internet services allow users to get around all censorship and shutdowns by connecting via satellites.
The government was able to jam and interfere with some Starlink users but it has been confirmed to the BBC that other terminals remain operational after the company updated its firmware to bypass government blocking efforts.
The service, which is owned by Elon Musk, also waived subscription fees for Iranian users.
In spite of the increasing tools being used by repressive regimes, Woodward is surprisingly optimistic about the future of internet.
He cites advances in LEO and the fact that many phones can now use satellites even when the internet is down for things like SOS messages.
There are also emerging apps that use mesh networks relying on Bluetooth, which can bring connectivity where there is none.
""Its almost inevitable that internet access will be truly universal eventually but it'll always be cat and mouse for repressive regimes"", Woodward says.

"US strike in Syria kills man linked to attack on soldiers, officials say",2026-01-17T23:02:50.338Z," Max Matza
","US forces have carried out a strike which killed an al-Qaeda leader ""who had direct ties"" to an Islamic State (IS) group terrorist responsible for an ambush which killed three Americans in Syria, officials have said.
The US Central Command (Centcom) said in a statement that Bilal Hasan al-Jasim was killed in the attack on Friday, which took place in northwest Syria.
The statement says he was ""directly connected"" with the IS group gunman who killed and injured American and Syrian personnel.
The BBC has not independently verified the US claims.
""The death of a terrorist operative linked the death of three Americans demonstrates our resolve in pursuing terrorists who attack our forces,"" said Centcom commander Adm Brad Cooper.
""There is no safe place for those who conduct, plot, or inspire attacks on American citizens and our warfighters. We will find you.""
The US has been carrying out large-scale strikes on IS targets in Syria, dubbed Operation Hawkeye Strike, since the deaths of the three American on 13 December 2025 in Palmyra, central Syria.
So far, the US has hit more than 100 ""infrastructure and weapons site targets"", using 200 precision munitions, according to Centcom.
Earlier this month, Centcom said it had killed or captured nearly 25 IS group members in 11 missions between 20 December and 29 December.
Syria has been in a fragile state since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime in December 2024, which effectively ended a civil war that had ravaged the country for 13 years.
Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known by his nom-de-guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has been serving as the country's president since his rebel group ousted Assad and solidified control.
IS has been weakened in Syria, but still remains active, predominantly carrying out attacks against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east in 2025.

Iran supreme leader acknowledges thousands killed during recent protests,2026-01-17T20:14:57.214Z," Jack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad
BBC Persian
","Iran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests.
In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed, ""some in an inhuman, savage manner"", and blamed the US for the deaths.
A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.
US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to ""keep protesting"" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.
""Those linked to Israel and the US caused massive damage and killed several thousand,"" Khamenei said, quoted by Iranian state media.
""We consider the US president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation.""
The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.
The Iranian government has called the demonstrations ""riots"" backed by Iran's enemies.
Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.
There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.
There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear.
A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that ""security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal"".
During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a ""criminal"" and said the US must be ""held accountable"" for recent unrest.
He also claimed on social media that ""America's goal is to swallow Iran"".
Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.
The US state department said on Saturday that it had ""heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases"".
It said Iran would be met with ""a very, very powerful force"" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to ""play games with President Trump"".
The US president said on Wednesday he had been told ""the killing in Iran has stopped"", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.
His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.
Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a ""precautionary measure"".

Big names on Trump's peace panel face huge challenges in Gaza,2026-01-17T14:31:00.066Z," John Sudworth
Jerusalem
","The White House has announced the first members of its Gaza ""Board of Peace"", and the list of names will do little to dispel the criticism from some quarters that the US president's plan resembles, at its heart, a colonial solution imposed over the heads of the Palestinians.
There are still several unknowns - namely who else might be added, and the exact structure of what is currently a rather complicated layout.
So far, no Palestinian names are included on the two separate senior boards that have been officially unveiled.
One is a ""founding Executive Board"", with a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy. The other, called the ""Gaza Executive Board"", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).
That committee is made up of supposedly technocratic, apolitical Palestinians, led by Dr Ali Shaath, a civil engineer by training who's held ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority.
But of the seven members of the founding Executive Board, six are Americans - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other members of Trump's inner circle like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, who is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, but also a friend of the president and a fellow real estate developer.
Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank, is something of an exception as an Indian-born US citizen. Sir Tony Blair, meanwhile, is a former UK Prime Minister, and his inclusion is likely to further fuel concerns about how the Board of Peace will operate.
Over the past few weeks, criticism of Sir Tony's possible inclusion has come from figures like prominent politician Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, and newspaper reports quoting unnamed officials from Arab states in the region.
Sir Tony's central role in the Iraq war, coupled with Britain's own colonial history in the Middle East, is deemed by his opponents to make him entirely unsuitable.
Francesca Albanese, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on social media last year: ""Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine.""
Even Trump seemed to acknowledge the issue.
""I've always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he's an acceptable choice to everybody,"" the president said last October.
There is significant overlap between the two senior boards, with Kushner, Witkoff and Sir Tony appearing on both.
But the Gaza Executive Board does include the names of some senior political figures and diplomats from Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It will be headed by the former Bulgarian politician, Nickolay Mladenov, who's been given the title of High Representative for Gaza.
Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus is the only Israeli member.
In its statement announcing the names, the White House said those chosen will work to ensure ""effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza"".
And whatever the concerns and complexities, the plan remains the only game in town, with many world leaders pledging their support and commitment to helping make it a success.
Its architecture is further complicated by the fact that, sitting above all the structures announced so far, will be the Board of Peace itself, with President Trump as the chairman.
Names of that supreme body have not yet been announced, but the current UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Egypt's Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Canadian leader Mark Carney have reportedly been invited to join.
In the end, whether the most vocal critics can be assuaged will depend on how quickly the new members of the senior teams can begin to drive change that makes a real difference in both daily life for Palestinians and, crucially, further concrete steps towards a lasting peace.
Major challenges remain to both of those goals.
The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter.
While aid groups say there has been some improvements, they accuse Israel of imposing continuing restrictions upon their work.
Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.
Showing meaningful progress towards rebuilding will also be a Herculean task, involving not only the removal of an estimated 60 million tonnes of rubble, but first finding and disposing of the dead bodies and unexploded bombs contained within it.
Perhaps the biggest challenge though is maintaining the fraying ceasefire itself.
Another name has been released by the White House, that of Major General Jasper Jeffers as the Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF).
Backed by a UN mandate, it will have the tough job of ensuring the demilitarisation of Gaza.
As yet, there's no clear road map for how Hamas will be persuaded to give up its weapons, nor any clear idea of which country will provide troops for that force or what its remit and rules of engagement will be.
Hamas has said it will only disarm as part of a wider deal establishing a Palestinian state.
Israel, whose ground troops still control more than half of the Gaza Strip, has said it will only withdraw if Hamas disarms.
How that catch-22 can be resolved is perhaps the biggest test of all.

Syrian army moves east of Aleppo after Kurdish forces withdraw,2026-01-17T12:06:47.214Z," Tinshui Yeung
","The Syrian army is moving into areas east of Aleppo city, after Kurdish forces started a withdrawal.
Syrian troops have been spotted entering Deir Hafer, a town about 50km (30 miles) from Aleppo.
On Friday, the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia announced it would redeploy east of the Euphrates river. This follows talks with US officials, and a pledge from Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa to make Kurdish a national language.
After deadly clashes last week, the US urged both sides to avoid a confrontation. President al-Sharaa is seeking to integrate the Kurds' military and civilian bodies into Syrian national institutions.
In a statement to state-run news agency Sana, the Syrian army said its forces ""began entering the western Euphrates area"", and declared it had established ""full military control"" of Deir Hafer.
The military urged civilians not to enter the operations area until it is secured and ""cleared it of all mines and war remnants"".
Images showed Syrian forces advancing towards the area, including with tanks.
The move comes after Kurdish leader Mazloum Abdi agreed to pull back his US-backed SDF ""towards redeployment in areas east of the Euphrates"", responding to ""calls from friendly countries and mediators"".
US special envoy Tom Barrack and Mazloum Abdi are set to meet later on Saturday in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.
In recent days, the Syrian army had urged civilians to flee the Deir Hafer area, with at least 4,000 people leaving, according to Syrian authorities.
Before the Kurdish withdrawal, President al-Sharaa said he would make Kurdish a national language, and recognise the Kurdish new year as an official holiday.
The decree, announced on Friday, is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946. It stated that Kurds were ""an essential and integral part"" of Syria, where they have endured decades of oppression under previous rulers.
Despite the apparent easing of tensions, disagreements linger. In response to the decree, the Kurdish administration in Syria's north and north-east said it was ""a first step"" but called for ""permanent constitutions that express the will of the people"", rather than ""temporary decrees"".
Both sides have accused each other of violating the terms of the agreement. Syria's army said two of its soldiers had been killed by Kurdish forces as the military moved in, while the SDF accused Damascus of sending troops in early.
Kurdish forces have been controlling swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and north-east, much of it gained during the civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.
Following the ousting of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in late 2024, President al-Sharaa has been seeking to integrate the Kurdish bodies into Syrian institutions.
In March 2025, the SDF signed a deal with the government to that effect. Almost a year on, the agreement is still not implemented, with each side blaming the other.

Exiled crown prince urges world to help protesters topple Iran's government,2026-01-16T19:07:26.189Z," Mallory Moench
","The exiled son of the last Iranian shah (king) has called on the world to help protesters topple Iran's government, saying he is confident ""the Islamic Republic will fall - not if, but when"".
Reza Pahlavi, a US-based opposition leader, asked the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guard leadership, which he said would ""facilitate our task and prevent more loss of life"".
More than 2,600 protesters have been killed, according to a human rights group, in demonstrations that started over the economy on 28 December and turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei.
The Iranian government has called the protests ""riots"" backed by Iran's enemies.
Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent figure in Iran's fragmented opposition and has previously urged Iranians to escalate their protests.
But protesters have been met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.
Speaking on Friday at a news conference in Washington, Pahlavi claimed that sections of Iran's security apparatus had refused to take part in the crackdown and that the Iranian authorities had brought in fighters from foreign militias to quell the protests.
He urged the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and command and control infrastructure, calling for a ""surgical strike"".
He also asked global powers to deliver economic pressure, expel Iranian diplomats, demand the release of all political prisoners, and deploy satellite internet Starlink and other secure communications to allow connectivity in Iran.
""The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully,"" he said.
""With or without the world's help, the regime will fall. It will fall sooner and more lives will be saved if the world turns its words into action.""
He declined to speak about reports that he had held discussions with senior US officials, but said: ""I believe that President Trump is a man of his word and, ultimately, he will stand with the Iranian people.""
Trump has previously warned Iran's government against killing protesters and told CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the US would take ""very strong action"" against Iran if it executed protesters.
He later said he had been told ""the killing has stopped"" - but did not rule out military action against the country.
Iran's parliament speaker had warned that if the US attacked, both Israel and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets.
The US and UK have reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, with officials telling CBS News it was a ""precautionary measure"".
On Friday, Pahlavi also vowed to return to Iran and laid out a plan for creating a new constitution in the country.
Asked about future leadership in Iran, he said: ""It's for the Iranian people to decide.""
He said he believes he can lead and has the Iranian people's support: ""I am trying to help them liberate themselves,"" he said.
Pahlavi said he supported a governing programme based on the principles of Iran's territorial integrity, a separation of religion and state, individual liberties and the right of the Iranian people to decide on the form of democratic government they want.
Pahlavi's father, the last shah of Iran, was overthrown in an Islamic revolution in 1979 and a devout Shia Muslim regime took over.
The current wave of protests began after shopkeepers in Iran's capital Tehran went on strike over the rising cost of living and the depreciating value of the currency.
They quickly spread across the country and turned against Iran's clerical establishment, particularly Khamenei. The slogans chanted by demonstrators have included ""Death to the dictator"" and ""Seyyed Ali [Khamenei] will be toppled this year"".
According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,677 deaths have been confirmed and more than 1,600 more are under review.
It reports that about 19,000 protesters have been arrested.
The Iranian government has imposed an internet blackout on the country since 8 January, with authorities stepping up their crackdown on protests.
The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.
Residents in four cities - Tehran, Karaj, Isfahan and Sanandaj - told the BBC on Friday there were no protests taking place. Security forces were still present on the streets and in public squares, some said.

'I was hit in the face by pellets': Iranians on border describe violence and more protests,2026-01-16T12:02:09.375Z," Lucy Williamson
Bashmaq border crossing
Iraqi Kurdistan
","At the border crossing from Iran into Iraqi Kurdistan, the stern face of Iran's former supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, peers down at the trickle of Iranians leaving the territory.
Thick snowflakes confetti the lorries and pedestrians arriving at this remote mountain pass.
Metres away, just beyond the border post, an Iranian flag flutters in the snow.
Iran has shut down the internet and blocked phone calls into the country, but its borders are still open.
Inside the arrivals hall, we find dozens of men, women and children – many arriving to visit family on the Iraqi side of the border.
No-one we met said they were fleeing Iran because of the recent protests and government crackdown, but one man – who asked us to hide his identity – told us security forces had shot him during a protest in central Iran last Friday.
""I was hit in the face by seven pellet rounds,"" he said, pointing out several weals and bruises on his face. ""They struck above my eyelid, on my forehead, my cheek, my lip, under my ear and along my jaw. I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out.""
He told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them.
""One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round,"" he told us. ""His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone. They're terrified of going to hospital to have it removed.""
Iran's regime has treated these protests as an existential threat. Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed.
But several people here told us that demonstrations had continued, at least into this week. The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere.
""Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran,"" he said. ""My friends were there. We were constantly on the phone. On Tuesday night, the protests were still going on, but I haven't had any updates since then.""
Iranians don't need a visa to cross here, and officials say there is regular traffic back and forth.
Another man we spoke to at the border said he had been in Tehran on Wednesday, and seen protesters on the street. It's not clear what form of protest that was, or how many were taking part.
The BBC has seen no hard evidence that street protests are still continuing. Very little footage at all is trickling out, and the reports we heard today are impossible to confirm. The BBC, along with other international media, is barred from reporting inside Iran.
The government's repression largely seems to be working. But the economic problems that sparked this crisis haven't gone away.
A teacher from a town close to the border told us she didn't care who the leader was, she just wanted the economic situation to improve.
""We don't want anything more than our basic rights,"" she told me. ""To own a house, to own a car, to have a normal life. My salary lasts 10 days, and I have to borrow money to cover the rest of the month. It's very bad.""
I ask about US President Donald Trump, and his threat of military strikes if the regime kept killing protesters.
""We're waiting to see what Trump does,"" he told me. ""In the meantime, civilians are getting killed.""
The force with which Iran's leaders have crushed this protest signals their weakness. The regional proxy groups they once used as defences against attack have been weakened by Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and by the fall of the former Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad.
And the Israeli-US war with Iran last year has depleted its military capabilities, and left it vulnerable to attack.
Hidden behind this mountainous border, Iran's regime is re-imposing its control.
But hidden behind that repressive control is the growing fear of the Islamic Republic, unable to meet its people's most basic demands: protection from foreign attacks, and prosperity at home.

"Israel moves Yellow Line deeper into Gaza, satellite images show",2026-01-16T00:02:44.572Z," Benedict Garman
Emma PengellyandMatt Murphy
BBC Verify
","Israel has moved the blocks which are supposed to mark its post-ceasefire line of control deeper into Gaza in several places, sowing confusion among Palestinians.
Satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that in at least three areas Israel placed blocks, before returning later and moving the positions further into the Strip.
Under the terms of the US-brokered deal with Hamas, Israel agreed to withdraw troops beyond a line marked in yellow on Israeli military maps, which it has illustrated on the ground with concrete yellow blocks.
Defence Minister Israel Katz warned in October that anyone crossing the Yellow Line would be ""met with fire"".
Since these comments were made, there have been a series of deadly incidents around the line.
In Beit Lahia, Jabalia and al-Tuffah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) placed blocks and later returned to move them deeper inside Gaza. In total, 16 positions were moved.
In the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, satellite images show that IDF troops moved at least seven already placed blocks between 27 November and 25 December.
The position of the markers were moved on average 295m (968ft) deeper inside the Strip.
As well as the blocks that have been moved, BBC Verify mapped 205 other markers. More than half of those have been placed significantly deeper inside the Strip than the line marked on maps.
An IDF spokesperson said it rejected ""all claims that the Yellow Line has been moved or its crossing by IDF troops"".
""The IDF is operating to visually mark the Yellow Line in accordance with the conditions on the ground and the ongoing operational situational assessment,"" they added.
Analysis of satellite images up to 11 January suggests some sections of the Yellow Line - which the head of Israel's military described as a ""new border line"" - also remain unmarked on the ground more than three months since the ceasefire began.
The latest satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that blocks have not been placed along roughly 10km (six miles) of territory - leaving some people in Gaza struggling to know where the beginning of what the IDF calls a ""dangerous combat zone"" is.
Last month, one 23-year-old man near Khan Younis - whom the BBC is not naming for his own safety - said Israeli troops suddenly moved blocks near him beyond the mapped line, leaving him ""trapped"".
""We are now living inside the Yellow Line, [but] behind the yellow blocks, with no idea what our fate will be,"" he said. ""The atmosphere at night is terrifying. We hear shells exploding, soldiers advancing, gunfire, and drones buzzing overhead without pause. We are also being shot at directly.""
Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, has called the movement of the blocks a ""tool for territorial engineering"".
""By keeping the legal line on the map and the physical blocks hundreds of metres apart, Israel preserves the ability to shift where Gazans may live, move and farm without ever formally announcing a change of border,"" he said.
But Efraim Inbar - president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security - suggested that the mapped line may not account for natural barriers to the markers and that IDF engineers may be putting the blocks where they ""find it easier to place"".
Since Katz's warning in October, troops have shot at people crossing the Yellow Line on at least 69 occasions, an analysis of IDF Telegram posts and statements to the BBC showed.
On 19 December, the IDF conducted a strike on a school sheltering displaced people in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City - some 330m inside the Palestinian side of the line, according to the IDF maps - but just metres from a yellow block that was moved there.
Eyewitnesses said it happened while a wedding was taking place right by the school building. Five people, including children, were killed in the blast, Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said.
An IDF statement relating to that day said they fired at ""suspicious individuals"" west of the Yellow Line, adding that the incident remained under review and that it ""regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals"".
In another deadly incident, 17-year-old Zaher Nasser Shamiya was killed near yellow blocks in Jabalia camp in northern Gaza. His father said IDF troops fired at him before running him over with a tank on 10 December.
""The tank turned his body into pieces… it came into the safe area [west of the Yellow Line] and ran over him,"" he said. BBC Verify has approached the IDF for comment on the incident.
And in November, local media reported that two children - aged eight and 10 or 11 - were killed by Israeli forces. Their uncle said that the pair had been gathering firewood for their disabled father when they were killed.
Addressing the deaths, an IDF statement said it had eliminated two suspects who crossed the Yellow Line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached IDF troops. It did not offer details on how the pair were identified as suspects.
An IDF spokesperson accused Hamas fighters of firing on troops six times ""beyond the Yellow Line"" over the past week, in a statement to BBC Verify.
While Israel agreed to withdraw its forces behind the Yellow Line under October's ceasefire deal, videos and satellite images seen by BBC Verify have repeatedly shown IDF vehicles operating beyond the mapped Yellow Line.
In verified clips, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen 400m past the mapped Yellow Line at the Bani Suhaila roundabout in Khan Younis, while a satellite image taken on 25 December appeared to show a tank, excavator and other IDF vehicles positioned about 260m beyond the Yellow Line in Beit Lahia.
In some cases, the movements of blocks were followed by demolitions of nearby buildings by the IDF.
In the eastern part of Gaza City, satellite images show that hundreds of buildings were levelled up to and even beyond the first position of the blocks, then the markers were moved and there was further destruction
In the nearby area of Jabalia, Israeli troops demolished a series of school buildings that were around 150m inside the mapped line.
In some instances where IDF demolitions have occurred, the debris has effectively hidden the markers from Palestinians on the ground.
An IDF spokesperson said that troops were dismantling Hamas' tunnel network that it said runs under buildings on both sides of the Yellow Line, adding that the tunnels' destruction ""may cause the collapse of buildings on both sides of the line"".
On Wednesday, the US said the second phase of the ceasefire deal is due to begin, under which Israel is expected to withdraw from additional parts of the Strip. But there was no mention of a timeline for the withdrawal, which is linked to the ""demilitarisation"" of Hamas under October's ceasefire deal.
In parts of the Strip, the markers have been placed shortly before work began on the construction of temporary Israeli fortifications such as roadblocks and defensive barriers beyond the mapped Yellow Line.
Krieg told BBC Verify that the movement of the blocks would eventually allow Israel to turn parts of Gaza into a ""sterilised belt"".
""In practice, that means the status of land is less about what the ceasefire map says and more about where concrete blocks sit on a given day,"" he said.

"Iran authorities demanding large sums for return of protesters' bodies, BBC told",2026-01-15T20:19:13.196Z," Jiyar Gol
BBC Persian
","Families of people killed in the protests in Iran have told the BBC that the authorities are demanding large sums of money to return their bodies for burial.
Multiple sources have told BBC Persian that bodies are being held in mortuaries and hospitals and that security forces will not release them unless their relatives hand over money.
At least 2,435 people have been killed during more than two weeks of protests across the country.
One family in the northern city of Rasht told the BBC that security forces demanded 700 million tomans ($5,000; £3,700) to release the body of their loved one.
It was being held at the Poursina Hospital mortuary, along with at least 70 other dead protesters, they said.
Meanwhile in Tehran, the family of a Kurdish seasonal construction worker went to collect his body, only to be told they must pay a billion tomans ($7,000; £5,200) to receive it.
The family told the BBC that they could not afford the fee and were forced to leave without their son's body. A construction worker in Iran typically earns less than $100 a month.
In some cases, hospital staff have phoned the relatives of the dead to give them an advance warning to come and get the bodies before security forces can extort any funds.
BBC Persian has been told about a woman - who we are not identifying for her safety - who did not know her husband was killed until she received a phone call on 9 January on his phone from hospital staff.
They told her she should quickly come and collect his body before security forces arrived and demanded payment for its release.
BBC Persian was told about this situation by a London-based relative, who has spoken to her.
The woman then took her two children to the hospital to find her husband's body. She put it in the back of a pickup truck, and drove for seven hours to their hometown in western Iran to bury him.
""I rode in the back of the pickup truck, crying over his body for seven hours while my children sat in the front seat,"" she told her London relative.
BBC Persian has also received reports that officials at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra mortuary are telling families that if they claim their child was a member of the Basij paramilitary force and was killed by protesters, the body will be released without charge.
The family member told the BBC in a message: ""We were asked to participate in a pro-government rally and portray the body as that of a martyr. We did not agree to this.""
In another case in Tehran, a source told BBC Persian that several families broke into a mortuary to retrieve bodies out of fear they would be taken away by the authorities.
""Several families, fearing that the authorities might keep the bodies or bury them without their knowledge, broke open the morgue door and pulled the bodies out of ambulances,"" the source told the BBC.
The families then guarded the bodies for several hours on the ground in the hospital courtyard to prevent them from being taken away until they could find private ambulances to transport them, the source said.
An internet and communications blackout has made it difficult to get a full picture of what is happening on the ground. International human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is not allowed by the Iranian government to report on the ground.
Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers and security forces launched a violent crackdown.
The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities.
According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,435 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 13 children and 153 people affiliated with the security forces or government. It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested.
Meanwhile, arrests have continued across the country. Security forces and Revolutionary Guard intelligence units have detained activists, lawyers, and ordinary citizens.

Iran judiciary denies plan to execute detained protester Erfan Soltani,2026-01-15T19:15:48.577Z," David GrittenandCaroline Hawley
","Iran's judiciary has denied it scheduled the execution of a man arrested in connection with the country's recent protests.
Norway-based Kurdish human rights organisation Hengaw said earlier this week that the family of Erfan Soltani, 26, had been told he faced execution on Wednesday, only days after he was detained.
On Wednesday, Hengaw cited them as saying Soltani's execution had been ""postponed"" but warned that ""serious and ongoing concerns"" regarding his life remained.
""This is good news. Hopefully, it will continue!"" said US President Donald Trump, who had warned Iran not to execute protesters.
The Iranian judiciary said Soltani faced charges of ""colluding against national security"" and ""propaganda activities against the establishment"", which are not punishable by the death penalty, state broadcaster IRIB reported.
It called reports by foreign media organisations that Soltani faced execution a ""blatant act of news fabrication"".
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also said in an interview with US television that there was ""no plan"" to hang people.
It came after Trump threatened to take ""very strong action"" if executions were carried out, amid mounting speculation of possible US military strikes.
On Wednesday, he told reporters that ""very important sources on the other side"" had informed him ""the killing in Iran is stopping, and there's no plan for executions"".
Soltani, a clothes shop owner, was arrested at his home last Thursday in connection with the protests in the northern city of Fardis, west of Tehran, according to the group and his family.
However, the judiciary said he was arrested during ""riots"" on Saturday and was being held in a prison in the neighbouring city of Karaj, according to IRIB.
Speaking to the BBC from Europe, a relative called Somayeh said Soltani was still in jail and she remained concerned about him, although she had heard very little news because of the internet blackout in Iran.
However she said a message sent via the Starlink satellite internet service had said he had not had a defence lawyer and his family were under a lot of pressure from the authorities.
""Erfan is the heart of that family. He's a very calm, very kind person,"" she said, adding that he loved photography, sport and animals and had just wanted ""basic rights"" for himself and the people of Iran.
""He had thousands of hopes for himself and other young people.""
Somayeh said the Iranian government had hoped that executing Erfan would ""scare people into stopping the protests"".
""They didn't have any reason to arrest Erfan. There are many Erfans. The only strategy of the government is to end the protests this way,"" she said.
Later on Thursday, the US Treasury department said Trump had directed it to impose new sanctions on five senior Iranian officials whom it accused of being ""the architects of the Iranian regime's brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators"".
They included the secretary of the Supreme Council for National Security, Ali Larijani, who the Treasury said co-ordinated the response to the protests, as well as the commanders of the Revolutionary Guards and police forces in the western province of Lorestan and southern province of Fars, where the Treasury said security personnel had shot dead many civilians.
Responding to the judiciary's statement, the director of the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights said threats of the death penalty against detainees and their families were not uncommon.
The chief justice, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, has advocated for the swift trial and punishment of arrested ""rioters"".
""Those elements who beheaded people in the streets or burned people alive must be tried and punished as quickly as possible,"" he said in a video on Wednesday. ""If we don't do it fast, it won't have the same impact.""
Justice Minister Amin Hossein Rahimi meanwhile said that any individual arrested during the protests that took place between last Thursday and Saturday was ""definitely a criminal"".
Over the past three years, Iran has hanged at least 12 men who were sentenced to death in connection with the 2022 ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" protests. Human rights groups said their convictions came after torture-tainted ""confessions"" and grossly unfair trials.
The current wave of protests began after shopkeepers in Tehran went on strike over the rising cost of living and the depreciating value of the currency.
They quickly spread across the country and turned against Iran's clerical establishment, particularly the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The slogans chanted by demonstrators have included ""Death to the dictator"" and ""Seyyed Ali [Khamenei] will be toppled this year"".
The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.
According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,453 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 14 children, 156 people affiliated with the security forces or government, and 14 uninvolved civilians.
It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested.
Iran Human Rights says it has so far verified the killing of at least 3,428 protesters by security forces and estimates that around 20,000 people have been arrested.
Canada's Foreign Minister, Anita Anand, said on Thursday that a Canadian citizen had ""died in Iran at the hands of Iranian authorities"", without identifying them.
""Peaceful protests by the Iranian people - asking that their voices be heard in the face of the Iranian regime's repression and ongoing human rights violations - have led the regime to flagrantly disregard human life,"" she added.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also said a staff member of the Iranian Red Crescent, Amir Ali Latifi, had been killed and five of his colleagues wounded ""in the line of duty in Gilan province"" on 10 January.

Pitfalls loom as Trump's Gaza peace plan enters second phase,2026-01-15T12:31:13.849Z," Jon Donnison
Correspondent
Jerusalem
","On the face of it, the announcement of phase two of President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza would seem like progress.
But there remains a huge lack of clarity and detail about the future of the strip and the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there.
Furthermore, there are many pitfalls.
First, Trump's plan demands that Hamas, as well as other groups in Gaza, agree to disarm.
Announcing phase two of the deal, the US Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said failure to do so would ""bring serious consequences"".
But Hamas has so far adamantly refused to give up its weapons, which it sees as tools of resistance to Israel's decades-long military occupation.
If it maintains that position, there are already far-right members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government who are champing at the bit to resume the war and ""finish the job"".
While massively diminished militarily, US intelligence has long estimated that Hamas has likely recruited more new members in Gaza than have been killed by Israel during the war.
The ceasefire, which has been in place since October last year, is already fragile at best.
Both sides have accused each other of repeated violations.
More than 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.
The Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups during the same period.
Secondly, there is little clarity over to what extent Israel will be required to withdraw its forces from Gaza.
It has given no indication that it is willing to pull back completely, insisting it needs to maintain a strong security presence in Gaza.
Israel officials talk of ""a new reality"" in Gaza, insisting that the strip will never go back to the way it was before Hamas launched its deadly attack on 7 October 2023.
So, there could be continued wrangling over how far Israeli forces withdraw.
Then there is the issue of governance.
Who will run Gaza, if not Hamas, which came to power after winning Palestinian elections almost exactly 20 years ago?
Who will provide policing, security, schools, hospitals?
For more than a year now, there has been the idea that some sort of International Stabilization Force could provide security in Gaza.
Egypt, Turkey, the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as the West Bank-based, Palestinian Authority, have all been suggested as potential countries that would make up this force.
But none have committed and, again, the detail is unclear.
Anyone seen as ""riding in on the back of Israeli tanks"" is likely to meet a frosty reception from Palestinians in Gaza.
Under Trump's peace plan, Gaza will supposedly have three levels of governance.
As the lowest level, the strip will be run by a new government of technocrats made up of figures from civil society within Gaza.
The names of its members were announced on Wednesday, with Hamas having agreed to have no role in the government.
Above that will be an Executive Committee based outside Gaza to oversee the new government's work.
It is likely to be made up of non-Palestinians, with former British prime minister Tony Blair said be among those who will sit on the committee.
Blair is widely distrusted by Palestinians, being seen as too close to Israel, and for his role, alongside former US president George W Bush, in the second Iraq War launched in 2003.
Finally, above the Executive Committee will be the Board of Peace, with Trump as its chairman.
The current British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are rumoured to be among the board's proposed members.
Many Palestinians say having foreigners in effect running Gaza smacks of colonialism.
The question is: do they have a choice?
And all the while, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains utterly bleak.
Since the ceasefire was announced last October, more aid has been allowed into the strip, but aid agencies say it is still nowhere near enough.
Hundreds of thousands of Gazans remain homeless and are living in makeshift tents.
The last few months in the region has seen grim winter weather, with torrential rain, high winds and temperatures below 5C (41F).
Gaza has experienced severe flooding, with buildings collapsing and tents blown away.
Most children have had little or no education for more than two years.
What does the future hold for them?
So, while phase two of the peace plan may seem like progress, there remain many reasons for pessimism.

Trump told 'killing has stopped' in Iran after violent protest crackdown,2026-01-15T04:57:26.858Z," Tabby Wilson
","Donald Trump has said he has been told ""the killing in Iran has stopped"", but the US president has not ruled out military action against the country over its violent crackdown on anti-government protesters.
According to human rights groups, more than 2,400 people have been killed in the recent crackdown by the Iranian authorities in response to nationwide protests.
Trump's comments on Wednesday came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar. Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a ""precautionary measure"".
Iran's airspace was closed to nearly all flights for five hours overnight, with several airlines announcing that they will reroute flights around Iran.
The UK's Foreign Office has also temporarily closed the British embassy in Tehran, which will now operate remotely, a government spokesperson said.
Trump had earlier threatened ""very strong action"" against Iran if the government executed protesters, after reports emerged that a 26-year-old man who had been arrested during the height of the demonstrations had been sentenced to death.
Erfan Soltani was scheduled to be executed on Wednesday, his family had told BBC Persian. They later told the Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw that his execution had been postponed.
On Thursday, Iranian state media said Soltani was arrested during the protests but denied he was sentenced to death.
Speaking from the White House, Trump said his administration had been told ""on good authority"" that ""the killing in Iran is stopping, and there's no plan for executions"".
When questioned by a reporter, Trump said that ""very important sources on the other side"" had informed him of the developments, adding that he hoped the reports were true.
Iranian authorities have reportedly failed to give Soltani's family any more information about his case, citing only that he had been arrested in connection with a protest.
The clothes shop owner was detained in the city of Fardis, just west of Tehran, last week.
Responding to reports of potential executions, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said ""hanging is out of the question"" and there would be ""no hanging today or tomorrow"".
Speaking to Fox News, he also warned the US president to ""not repeat the same mistake that you did in June,"" adding: ""If you try a failed experience, you will get the same result."" In June 2025, the US bombed three of Iran's nuclear sites over fears Tehran could use them to build a nuclear weapon.
Initial demonstrations over the collapse of the Iranian currency began in late December, but swiftly expanded into a wider crisis of legitimacy for Iran's clerical leadership.
In addition to the temporary closure of the British embassy in Tehran, the US Mission to Saudi Arabia has advised its personnel and citizens to ""exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region"".
Italy and Poland have published statements urging their citizens to leave Iran, while Germany has issued a notice to air operators recommending that flights do not enter Iranian airspace, citing potential risk from ""escalating conflict and anti-aviation weaponry"".
German airline Lufthansa issued a statement confirming its flights would avoid Iranian and Iraqi airspace ""until further notice"".
The US embassy in Doha has advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to the Al-Udeid air base, while the Qatari government said it would continue to ""implement all necessary measures to safeguard the security and safety of its citizens and residents"".
Al-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle East with about 10,000 personnel based there, as well as around 100 UK staff. It is not clear how many will be leaving.
Earlier this week, the US president had urged Iranians to ""KEEP PROTESTING"" via a post on his Truth Social platform, promising that ""HELP IS ON ITS WAY"".
Trump has been reluctant to lend his support to any challengers to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying that ""we aren't really up to that point yet"" in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday.
When asked whether he could support Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, Trump said ""I don't know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me"".
""He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country,"" Trump added.
Many Iranian demonstrators called for Pahlavi's return during the protests which began more than three weeks ago, but it is difficult to establish the extent of his backing within the country.
Trump also said that the Iranian government could fall due to the protests, but added that ""any regime can fail"".
Tehran has imposed an internet blackout on the country since last Thursday, as authorities stepped up their crackdown on anti-government demonstrations.
The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,435 protesters, as well as 13 children. The group said a further 882 deaths remain under investigation.

Concern for couple jailed in Tehran as British embassy closes,2026-01-15T04:41:50.886Z," Yang Tian
","The son of a British couple detained in Iran has expressed his concern for their welfare after the UK's embassy was closed in Tehran amid the deadly crackdown on anti-regime protests.
Joe Bennett's parents, Craig and Lindsay Foreman, were on a trip around the world when they were arrested by Iranian authorities in January last year and charged with spying.
Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, Bennett said the couple are in a ""dangerous position"" and that there was ""overcrowding"" in the jail due to the protests.
He added that the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) told him they were still ""assessing the situation"".
The FCDO previously told the BBC it continued to raise the case of the Foremans directly with the Iranian authorities.
The UK government announced the temporary closure of its embassy in Tehran on Wednesday, saying it would now operate remotely.
""We have temporarily closed the British Embassy in Tehran, this will now operate remotely. Foreign Office travel advice has now been updated to reflect this consular change,"" a government spokesperson said.
Britain's ambassador and all consular staff were evacuated based on a security assessment and concerns for staff safety.
Bennett said if his parents were released, they had planned to go to the British embassy.
""The trouble is, their plan was to go to the embassy, was to try to get to the embassy because they feel that that's safe ground and now... Where do they go? What do they do?"" he said.
Bennett, who last spoke to his parents on Wednesday, said during the brief communication he's been able to have, they've told him of the ""unsafe"" and ""frightening"" conditions of the prison.
""There are vermin in the kitchen and in beds. It is overcrowded, it's even more overcrowding now that these protests have gone on in Tehran,"" he said.
He added there were ""fights that break out pretty much daily"" which he could hear in the background during the phone calls with his mother.
Last year, Scottish National Party MP Brendan O'Hara told the BBC the couple were being used ""bargaining chips"" between Iran's government and the West.
Bennett also expressed the family's ""frustration"" with the perceived lack of support from the government to secure his parents' release.
""I look at other nations, France for example, US, Italy, when their citizens are put in a similar situation, there's an advocacy from them at the highest level of government... and the UK haven't done that,"" he said.
The family just wanted the government to show ""a sign of solidarity"" with their plight, Bennett added.
The Foreman's legal representatives in Iran formally submitted an application for bail this week.
Both of their Iranian defence lawyers have also written to the court, stating that the pair were innocent and that there was no lawful basis for their continued detention, according to the family.
As Iran continues its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests which has killed at least 2,400 people according to a human rights agency, Bennett said he just wants to ensure his parents' safe return.
""My mum and Craig are two innocent UK citizens that are caught up in the middle of all of this. So for us, it's about their safety and prompt return home however that comes,"" he said.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: ""We remain deeply concerned that Craig and Lindsay Foreman have been charged with espionage in Iran. We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities.
""We continue to provide Craig and Lindsay with consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members.""

"Who is Erfan Soltani, Iranian protester who reportedly had execution postponed?",2026-01-14T21:39:03.969Z," Malu Cursino
","A human rights group has said a man arrested in connection with protests in Iran has had his execution postponed, while the Iranian judiciary has denied reports he has been sentenced to death.
Erfan Soltani, 26, was arrested last Thursday in the city of Fardis, just west of Tehran. Days later, authorities informed his family his execution had been scheduled for Wednesday without giving any additional details, according to Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw.
In an update on Wednesday evening, Hengaw said it had ""serious and ongoing concerns regarding Soltani's right to life"" but that, according to information obtained through relatives, his execution was postponed.
On Thursday, Iran's judiciary denied reports the 26-year-old was sentenced to death. Instead, the judiciary said Soltani faced security-related charges carrying prison terms only.
The internet blackout imposed by the government has also made obtaining information on his status - and others in potentially similar situations - difficult.
Awyar Shekhi of Hengaw told the BBC on Wednesday she feared there were ""many"" cases like Soltani's, highlighting the scale and speed to which Iranian authorities were carrying out violent crackdowns compared to previous protests.
On Tuesday, one of Soltani's relatives told BBC Persian that a court had issued a death sentence ""in an extremely rapid process, within just two days"".
Soltani is a resident of Fardis, Karaj, where he owns a clothes shop. He was arrested ""at his private residence"", Hengaw said in a statement.
Iranian authorities had reportedly failed to give Soltani's family any more information about his case, citing only that he had been arrested in connection with a protest.
His sister, who is a lawyer, had tried to pursue the case but authorities told her there was nothing to pursue, Shekhi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""He is just someone who is against the current situation in Iran... now he's received a death sentence for expressing his opinion.""
Shekhi said prisoners on death row in Iran were typically granted a final visit by their loved ones before their execution.
While the Iranian authorities had told the family they would allow a meeting with Soltani before his execution, he had not been allowed any contact with his family since his arrest, she added.
There was a ""high chance"" other people in Iran were in a similar position to Soltani, but there was little information about them because of the internet shutdown, according to Shekhi.
President Donald Trump has said the US will take ""very strong action"" against Iran if it executes protesters - telling Iranians to ""KEEP PROTESTING"" in a post on his Truth Social platform. He also said he has cancelled all meetings with Iranian officials ""until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY"".
He has since said that his administration had been told ""on good authority"" that ""the killing in Iran is stopping, and there's no plan for executions"".
The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,417 protesters, as well as 12 children and 10 uninvolved civilians, despite the blackout. Nearly 150 people affiliated with the security forces or government had also been killed, the group said.
At least 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, according to HRANA.
Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei has pledged swift legal action against what he called ""rioters"". According to Mohseni-Ejei, those who have ""committed terrorist acts should definitely be given priority for trial and punishment"".
Authorities were also planning to hold open trials for some of the main figures involved in recent unrest, with proceedings accessible to the media, he said on Wednesday.
But Iran's handling of Soltani's case ""constitutes a clear violation of international human rights law"", Hengaw's statement said, adding: ""The rushed and non-transparent handling of this case has heightened concerns over the use of the death penalty as a tool to suppress public protests.""
""Erfan is the first protester to be sentenced to death, but he won't be the last,"" the US State Department said on its Farsi-language X account.
The protests, which have reportedly spread to more than 180 cities and towns in all 31 provinces, were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living.
They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
At least 12 men have been executed in Iran over the past three years after being sentenced to death in connection with the 2022 ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" protests.
That nationwide unrest was triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was accused by morality police of wearing ""improper"" hijab.
Human rights groups say the last such execution happened on 6 September, when Mehran Bahramian was hanged in Isfahan.
The Norway-based group, Iran Human Rights, reported at the time that the authorities had tortured Bahramian to obtain confessions and that he did not receive a fair trial.
He was sentenced to death by a court in January 2024 on the charge of ""enmity against God"" for allegedly killing a member of the Revolutionary Guards at a protest in Semirom in December 2022, it said.

'I carried my wife's body for an hour and a half' - BBC hears stories of protesters killed in Iran,2026-01-14T20:35:49.627Z," Sarah Namjoo and Roja Assadi
BBC Persian
","Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of death and injury
Heading home after joining a protest in Tehran on 8 January, Reza put his arms around his wife Maryam to protect her. ""Suddenly, I felt my arm go light – there was only her jacket in my hands,"" he told a family member, who later spoke to BBC Persian. Maryam had been fatally shot - and they had no idea where the bullet had come from.
Reza carried Maryam's body for an hour and a half. Exhausted, he sat down in an alley. After a short time, the door of a nearby house opened. The people who lived there took them into their garage, brought a white sheet and wrapped Maryam's body in it.
Days before Maryam headed out to the protests, she had told her children - aged seven and 14 – about what was happening in their country. ""Sometimes parents go to the protests and don't come back,"" she said. ""My blood, and yours, is no more precious than anyone else's.""
Reza and Maryam's names have been changed for safety reasons.
Maryam is one of thousands of protesters who should have returned home but never did, as the authorities responded to the rapid spread of demonstrations across Iran with a deadly crackdown.
The US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has been able to confirm the killing of at least 2,400 protesters, including 12 children, during the past three weeks.
It is extremely difficult to determine the death toll, which is expected to rise in the coming days, because the country remains under a near-total internet blackout imposed by Iranian authorities on Thursday night.
Human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is unable to report on the ground.
Iranian authorities have not provided a death toll but local media have reported 100 security personnel have been killed, and protesters - whom they have portrayed as ""rioters and terrorists"" - have set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities.
Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers.
Security forces soon launched a violent crackdown, with at least 34 protesters reported killed by 7 January, the 11th day of the unrest. However, it appears the bloodiest crackdown was last Thursday and Friday, when thousands of people took to the streets across the country and called for an end to the rule of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
BBC Persian has received dozens of accounts from inside Iran. Defiant despite potential repercussions, the witnesses said they wanted to ensure the rest of the world knew of the violence against the protesters.
""Our neighbourhood smells of blood - they killed so many,"" one told BBC Persian. Another recalled security forces ""mostly shooting at heads and faces"".
The protests have spread across all 31 provinces. And the information trickling in clearly shows the scale of the killings in smaller cities and towns is just as severe as in major cities.
In Tonekabon, a town of 50,000 people in the north, Sorena Golgun was killed on Friday. The 18-year-old university student was ""shot in the heart"" running from an ambush by security forces, according to a family member.
Like Sorena, many of the other protesters killed were young and full of dreams. Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion-design student who hoped to study in Milan, was shot dead in Tehran on Thursday.
Her mother spent about six hours travelling from their home, in the western city of Kermanshah, to collect Robina's body from Tehran. On her way back, she held her beloved daughter in her arms. But when she arrived, the security forces made her bury the body in a remote cemetery outside the city - with no other family or friends present.
Not all those killed were protesters. Navid Salehi, a 24-year-old nurse in Kermanshah, was shot multiple times leaving work on Thursday.
The bodies of many protesters were sent to the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre, in Tehran.
The scenes there were so distressing Sahanand, who did not want to give his real name, decided to travel almost 1,000km to a border area so he could send out video footage by using the mobile data networks of neighbouring countries. On Saturday, Sahanand had seen more than 2,000 bodies lying on the ground, he said.
Again, the BBC has no means to confirm this. However, in two newly emerged videos from Kahrizak, BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in one piece of footage and at least 178 bodies in the other. The two videos probably show some of the same bodies, so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.
One young woman, speaking to BBC Persian on condition of anonymity, described last week's events as like ""a war"". The protesters remained ""more united than ever before"" but it was too much for her and this week she had fled the country - like many, gripped by fear the authorities will start a new wave of executions and prosecutions.
""I'm really afraid of what might happen to those who are still in Iran,"" she added.

Starlink reportedly made free in Iran - but protesters are taking huge risks by using it,2026-01-14T18:15:52.271Z," Reha Kansara and Ghoncheh Habibiazad
BBC News and BBC Persian
","Starlink has reportedly waived monthly subscription payments for users inside Iran after its government shut down the internet last Thursday - cutting off millions of people from their families, livelihoods and access to information, during a deadly crackdown on protests.
The satellite technology has become a vital communications lifeline for some of those in the country trying to tell the outside world what has been happening on the ground in recent days.
Two people in Iran told BBC Persian their device was running on Tuesday night even though they had not been keeping up with subscription payments. The director of an organisation that helps Iranians get online also told BBC Persian that Starlink had been made free.
The satellite technology, which belongs to Elon Musk's SpaceX company, provides internet to tens of thousands of people in Iran, despite the fact it is illegal there. Since the internet was shut down, it has become one of the last, if not the last, remaining channels for Iranians to communicate with the outside world.
The BBC has approached SpaceX to confirm it has waived the fee, but they are yet to respond.
Using the service in Iran carries a punishment of up to two years in prison and authorities have reportedly been searching for Starlink dishes to stop people from connecting to the internet.
""They're going onto rooftops and checking the surrounding buildings,"" says Parsa - not his real name - who spoke to BBC Persian using a Starlink connection.
""What people need to know is that the government is searching areas where a lot of footage has come out, so they need to be even more cautious,"" he says.
The device operates like a mobile phone mast in space, using a constellation of satellites to communicate with small dishes on the ground with a built-in WiFi router.
But the device is costly and beyond the means of many in Iran - so making it free may lead to its wider use.
Why are there protests in Iran and what has Trump said about US action?
Bowen: Authoritarian regimes die gradually then suddenly, but Iran is not there yet
Speaking to Al Jazeera TV on Monday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the internet had been cut off ""after we confronted terrorist operations and realised orders were coming from outside the country"".
Iran's Fars news agency, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), claimed internet restrictions were imposed to stop foreign social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram being used ""to organise violence and unrest.""
Human rights groups have condemned the blanket blackout as an abuse of power and a spokesperson for the UN's Human rights office told the BBC the shutdown ""impacts the works of those documenting human rights violations.""
So far, one human rights group has confirmed the killing of more than 2,400 protesters during the unrest, as well as almost 150 people affiliated with security forces, although these numbers are believed to be much higher.
It is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country.
The internet shutdown has also made it hard to gather and verify evidence of what is happening on the ground.
""I think a lot of people are connected, but only a very small number are taking the risk of sending information out,"" explains Parsa.
According to human rights organisation Witness, at least 50,000 people are using Starlink to access the internet.
Mahsa Alimardani, who works as its associate director for technology, threats and opportunities, says the Iranian authorities have tried ""aggressively jamming"" Starlink to stop people accessing the internet but it has not been successful. ""That's why they are resorting to physical confiscations,"" she adds.
But those who are taking the risk are going to great lengths. One man who spoke to BBC Persian said he travelled almost 1,000km (620 miles) to a border area so he could use mobile networks of neighbouring countries to send video he recorded.
The scene he witnessed - of a huge number of bodies lying on the ground at a forensic medical centre in Tehran - was so distressing that he felt compelled to share it, he told the BBC.
The Iranian government has a long track record of spying on its citizens, including digitally, to tighten its grip on society.
Phishing techniques have reportedly been used to hack phones and access people's data and Iran's access to the internet is largely restricted to a domestic service that mimics a private intranet.
Access to foreign social media platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp and Telegram is blocked, meaning Iranians have to use virtual private networks (VPNs) in order to access them.
But despite this, Instagram is one of the most popular platforms in Iran, with an estimated 50 million users.
Though some news is being shared online, experts say the Iranian government aims to control the narrative by limiting what information gets out.
Ana Diamond, research associate at the Oxford Disinformation and Extremism Lab, says the government is weaponising information by carefully curating it.
""Such material is designed less to inform than to condition; to almost normalise casualties, especially as the Iranian government calls them rioters, eroding collective resistance, and preparing the public - both inside and outside of Iran - for escalations of violence that may be yet to come if the protests continue,"" Diamond says.
Despite the dangers, Starlink has become indispensable for many Iranians communicating what is happening inside the country to the rest of the world.
""I'd rather not think about it [getting caught]. It can be very frightening,"" Parsa says.
On Tuesday, Iranian intelligence forces said they had seized a large consignment of Starlink kits allegedly intended for ""espionage and sabotage operations"" inside the country.
However, BBC Persian has confirmed through multiple sources in Iran that the kits are used by many people wanting to communicate without censorship.
Parsa cautions that getting caught using the device is not the only danger.
If Iranians want to send videos that are shared or intercepted online, he says, ""they need to understand that if they record them from home or from the place where the device is kept, their risk increases, and the government can identify the location"".

Tehran morgue videos show the brutality of Iran's crackdown on protesters,2026-01-14T16:58:31.569Z," Shayan Sardarizadeh

","Warning: this story contains content which some readers might find distressing
Distressing new videos have emerged from a mortuary in Tehran showing rows of bodies, blood soaked floors and crowds of people searching for loved ones following a deadly government crackdown on protesters in Iran.
The videos analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian, which are too graphic to show, contain some of the most shocking examples so far of how brutal the government's retaliation has been since the unrest began on 28 December.
Forensic examination of the footage reveals nearly 200 bodies laid throughout the mortuary complex, many with visible wounds and one victim identified as young as 16.
Anti-government demonstrations have spread to more than 68 towns and cities, verified videos show, though the true figure is likely to be much higher. The near total internet blackout imposed by the government since last week has left more than 90 million Iranians almost completely cut off from the outside world.
The number of people who have been killed in the protests is not fully known. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) places the estimate at more than 2,500. An Iranian official previously told Reuters 2,000 people have been killed but claimed ""terrorists"" were to blame.
BBC Verify and BBC Persian have previously reported on images emerging from this mortuary but we are not showing these new videos because the images are too graphic.
The footage was posted on Tuesday by Vahid, a US-based Iranian social media influencer and activist, who said they were filmed on 10 January inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in south Tehran.
Vahid said the videos were filmed by a man who had travelled nearly 1,000km to find internet access. The man told BBC Persian he used mobile networks from neighbouring countries to upload the footage. Vahid has been posting dozens of videos documenting events inside the country for the outside world to see.
Two of the videos show rows of body bags on the floor as the man walks up and down a road that runs through the northern section of the vast mortuary complex. He later moves through a courtyard and inside a large warehouse, and walks in and out of adjacent rooms filled with more body bags. At one point he is heard describing the scene as ""the apocalypse"".
The man filming is heard saying, ""Today is Saturday, a day after the call"". He is referring to the call made by Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah, for nationwide protests that took place last Thursday and Friday night.
Two more clips contain a collection of photos taken from the mortuary showing several bodies wrapped in the zip-up bags, including one which appears burnt.
BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in the five-minute video and at least 178 bodies in the 16-minute clip. The two videos likely show some of the same bodies so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.
The videos contain at least nine separate clips edited together. The positions of shadows in the footage indicate these sections were likely filmed at different times throughout the day. We have matched identifiable features from the complex, including separate buildings, the red roof of a warehouse and fences with satellite images on Google.
The man films as he moves around inside the centre, where more bodies are kept on stretchers as well as the floor. The footage shows some body bags fully zipped up while others are either half or entirely unzipped, revealing victims' faces and injuries. Some are completely uncovered. We can see blood-soaked towels and sheets scattered around the complex with streaks of blood on the floor.
A number of the bodies have visible wounds. Two bodies appear to be soaked in blood, and another is seen with a deep stomach wound.
Some body bags have papers attached to them or details written on the body bags in a white marker such as a name, national ID number, date of birth and death, and in some cases their father's name. At least two men are described as unidentified on a sheet of paper attached to their bag, and at least one woman and one teenager are among the victims.
The date of death on three of the male victims' body bags states 9 January. Another body bag shows a date of birth using the Iranian calendar. It says 1/1/1388, which corresponds to 21/3/2009, indicating that it belongs to a 16-year-old.
During one moment in the 16-minute clip the man points his phone at a building to his right and a voice can be heard saying: ""There are many [bodies] inside. It's not possible to go inside… this is the women's area"". Iranian mortuaries separate the bodies of men and women for religious reasons.
At a different point we can see a body bag at the back of a hearse and a man nearby is heard telling a female official that it is his sister.
Several ambulances, hearses and vans are filmed around the grounds. Officials are seen inspecting the rows of bodies, taking swabs from the victims, and talking to potential loved ones.
It is not clear why the bodies of those killed in anti-government protests may have been transferred to the centre, but eyewitness accounts provided to BBC Persian suggest hospitals have been overwhelmed with the number of casualties in the protests.
HRANA, which has been tracking the death toll since the unrest began, has reported that 2,403 protesters, 147 people affiliated with the government, nine civilians and 12 children have been killed so far.
Crowds of people, many who appear to be family members and friends, are seen walking in and out of the complex as they try to identify the bodies. Cries and wails are repeatedly heard throughout the videos as people mourn the loss of their loves ones.
""Some of our best people have been killed,"" the man filming is heard saying.
Iranian state TV has since reported that a ""substantial"" number of bodies had been taken to the mortuary. It claimed the majority of the victims were members of Iran's security forces or passers-by who had nothing to do with the demonstrations.
Most international news organisation, including the BBC, are restricted from operating inside the country so we have to rely on verifying footage on social media.

Trump vows 'very strong action' if Iran executes protesters,2026-01-14T09:00:19.695Z,No Author Listed,
"Bowen: Authoritarian regimes die gradually then suddenly, but Iran is not there yet",2026-01-13T16:47:26.233Z," Jeremy Bowen
International editor
","How does an authoritarian regime die? As Ernest Hemingway famously said about going broke – gradually then suddenly.
The protesters in Iran and their supporters abroad were hoping that the Islamic regime in Tehran was at the suddenly stage. The signs are, if it is dying, it is still at gradual.
The last two weeks of unrest add up to a big crisis for the regime. Iranian anger and frustration have exploded into the streets before, but the latest explosion comes on top of all the military blows inflicted on Iran in the last two years by the US and Israel.
But more significant for hard-pressed Iranians struggling to feed their families has been the impact of sanctions.
In the latest blow for the Iranian economy, all the UN sanctions lifted under the now dead 2015 nuclear deal were reimposed by the UK, Germany and France in September. In 2025 food price inflation was more than 70%. The currency, the rial, reached a record low in December.
While the Iranian regime is under huge pressure, the evidence is that it's not about to die.
Crucially, the security forces remain loyal. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979 the Iranian authorities have spent time and money creating an elaborate and ruthless network of coercion and repression.
In the last two weeks, the regime's forces obeyed orders to shoot their fellow citizens in the streets. The result is that the demonstrations of the last few weeks have ended - as far as we can tell in a country whose rulers continue to impose a communications black out.
At the forefront of the suppression of protest is the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the most important single organisation in the country.
It has the specific task of defending the ideology and system of government of the Islamic revolution of 1979, answering directly to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The IRGC is estimated to have something like 150,000 men under arms, operating as a parallel force to Iran's conventional armed military. It is also a major player in the Iranian economy.
A potent mix of power, money, corruption and ideology means it has every reason to defend the system.
The IRGC has an auxiliary force, the Basij militia, a volunteer paramilitary organisation. It claims to have millions of members. Some western estimates put its active duty contingent in the hundreds of thousands, still a very substantial total. The Basij are at the sharp end of the regime's crackdowns against protesters.
I saw the IRGC and the Basij in action in Tehran in 2009, as they moved to suppress huge demonstrations that followed a disputed presidential election. Basij volunteers lined the streets armed with rubber truncheons and wooden clubs.
Behind them were uniformed men with automatic weapons. Motorcycle squads roared around Tehran's broad avenues, descending on groups trying to protest. In less than two weeks, protests that had choked the streets were reduced to small groups of students chanting slogans and setting fire to rubbish skips.
At dusk, people went to their balconies and rooftops to chant God is greatest, as their parents had against the Shah, until that petered out too.
The seeming resilience of the internal security forces does not mean that the supreme leader or his lieutenants can or will relax. US President Donald Trump is still threatening to take action. The millions of Iranians who want the fall of the regime must be seething with resentment and anger.
In Tehran, the government and the supreme leader appear to be looking for ways to release some of the pressure they are facing. Bellicose official rhetoric is mixed with an offer to resume negotiations with the US.
It is hard to see how the two sides can make a deal over Iran's nuclear plans and ballistic missile programme that have defeated earlier rounds of talks. But negotiations could buy time for Iran, especially if Trump can be convinced that a deal, however unlikely, is possible.
As part of his pressure campaign, Trump says that he will slap a 25% tariff on the goods of any country that does business with Iran. Again, it is hard to see how that might work. China buys most of Iran's oil.
Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed a truce in their trade war last autumn, with a summit due to be held in Beijing in April. The summit will deal with the biggest issues facing the world's two superpowers. Would Trump want to jeopardise or disrupt the summit simply to keep up pressure on Iran?
In Tehran the biggest priority for the ageing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is to preserve the Islamic Republic's system of rule. More eruptions of protest can expect a severe response.
An advantage for the regime is lack of coherent leadership among protesters. The eldest son of the Shah deposed by the revolution almost half a century ago has been trying to be the leader they lack. His appeal seems to be limited by his family's history and his close links with Israel.
One lesson that might worry the clerics and military men in Tehran comes from their erstwhile ally, former President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. He seemed to have won his war, and was being slowly rehabilitated by Saudi Arabia and the Arab League when he was faced at the end of 2024 with a well organised rebel offensive.
Both Russia and Iran, his two most important allies were neither willing or perhaps able to save him. Within days, Assad and his family were flying into exile in Moscow.
An authoritarian regime decays gradually, then suddenly. When Assad's Syria collapsed, it went very fast. Another example that might be studied in Tehran is the downfall in 2011 of President Ben Ali of Tunisia, when the army moved to protect protesters from the internal security forces.
The fall of Ben Ali precipitated the resignation of Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He might have survived huge demonstrations had not the armed forces decided that to save their own position he had to go.
Could that happen in Iran? Perhaps. Not yet.
Opponents of the Islamic regime will hope for more pressure at home and abroad and the emergence of credible leadership, so that the process of decay will speed up, accelerating from gradual, to sudden.

UK summons Iranian ambassador over 'brutal' killings,2026-01-13T15:58:14.357Z," Alicia Curry
","The UK government has summoned the Iranian ambassador in response to the ongoing ""brutal"" killings of protesters in the country, the foreign secretary has said.
Thousands of people are feared dead or have been detained after a crackdown on anti-government protesters across Iran in recent days.
Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper outlined ""the UK's total abhorrence of the killings, the violence, and the repression that we are seeing"" in a Commons statement, and said she feared the death toll may be significantly higher than reported so far.
She also said the government would implement ""full and further sanctions"" against Iran targeting finance, energy, transport, software and other industries.
The Foreign Office has not specifically set out what form the new sanctions will take or when they will be put in place.
It is understood the meeting between Cooper and Iran's ambassador Seyed Ali Mousavi at the Foreign Office lasted just nine minutes.
Speaking in the Commons earlier on Tuesday, Cooper said the government ""will work further with the EU and other partners to explore what additional measures might now be needed in response to developments"".
Cooper, who spoke directly to the Iranian foreign minister on Monday to convey the UK's objections to the crackdown, said the decision to summon the ambassador on Tuesday came following ""horrific reports"" of violence overnight and to ""underline the gravity of the moment"".
In a diplomatic offensive, several European countries - including France, Spain, Finland, Belgium and Germany - have also summoned Iranian ambassadors.
Meanwhile, the US President Donald Trump is continuing to weigh up military intervention in the region after he introduced a 25% import tariff on countries doing business with Iran.
The protests, which began in December, were initially driven by economic hardship and rising inflation, but have since broadened into more widespread anti-regime rallies.
In response, Tehran's security forces have hit back with heavy force, with live ammunition being used against crowds and a wave of arrests being made.
Last Thursday, Iranian authorities also imposed a near total internet blackout in an effort to suppress the unrest. As a result, Iranians have been almost completely cut off from the outside world.
The country restricts international news organisations from operating there, hampering efforts to independently verify the number of people who have died during the protests.
Iranian authorities have accused foreign government of fomenting the unrest and have condemned ""terrorist actions"", state media reported.
But Cooper said Iran's leaders were ""peddling its manufactured narrative of foreign manipulation"".
She added: ""The United Kingdom condemns in the strongest of terms the horrendous and brutal killing of Iranian protesters, and we demand that the Iranian authorities respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of their citizens.""
Cooper also said British officials were in contact with Iranian counterparts about UK nationals detained there.
She confirmed a Foreign Office minister had met the family of Craig and Lindsay Foreman on Monday, a couple who were arrested and accused of espionage in Iran last January while on a motorcycle trip around the world.
Last year, a major report by Parliament's intelligence and security committee found the UK faces a ""rising"" and unpredictable threat from Iran, and raised particular concern over ""sharp increase"" in physical threats against opponents of Iran's regime in the UK.
At the time, the Iranian embassy in London ""wholly rejected"" the report's findings.
In October, the UK, France and Germany activated a so-called ""snapback"" mechanism to reintroduce sweeping UN economic and military sanctions on Iran for failing to comply with restrictions on its nuclear industry.
Cooper said the government had imposed over 220 sanctions on Iran since Labour came to power.
But shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel called for more information about what new sanctions would be put in place, and asked why the Iranian ambassador was not summoned sooner.

'They just kept killing': Eyewitnesses describe deadly crackdown in Iran,2026-01-12T19:54:32.804Z," Roja AssadiandSarah Namjoo
BBC Persian
","""I saw it with my own eyes - they fired directly into lines of protesters, and people fell where they stood.""
Omid's voice was shaking as he spoke, fearful of being traced. Breaking the wall of silence between Iran and the rest of the world takes immense courage, given the risk of reprisals by the authorities.
Omid, in his early 40s and whose name we have changed for his safety, has been protesting on the streets of a small city in southern Iran over the past few days against worsening economic hardship.
He said security forces had opened fire at unarmed protesters in his city with Kalashnikov-style assault rifles.
""We are fighting a brutal regime with empty hands,"" he said.
The BBC has received similar accounts of the crackdown by security forces following the widespread protests across the country last week.
Since then, internet access has been cut by the authorities, making reporting from Iran more difficult than ever. BBC Persian is banned from reporting inside Iran by the government.
One of the largest nationwide anti-government protests took place on Thursday, the twelfth night of demonstrations. Many people appear to have joined the protests on Thursday and Friday after calls from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution.
The following day, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said: ""The Islamic Republic will not back down."" It appears that the worst bloodshed occurred after that warning as security forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps take their orders from him.
Iranian authorities accused the US and Israel of fomenting trouble and condemned ""terrorist actions"", state media reported.
A young woman from Tehran said last Thursday felt like ""the day of judgement"".
""Even remote neighbourhoods of Tehran were packed with protesters - places you wouldn't believe,"" she said.
""But on Friday, security forces only killed and killed and killed. Seeing it with my own eyes made me so unwell that I completely lost morale. Friday was a bloody day.""
She said that, after Friday's killings, people were afraid to go out and that many were now chanting from alleys and inside their homes.
Tehran was a battlefield, she said, with protesters and security forces taking positions and cover on the streets.
But she added: ""In war, both sides have weapons. Here, people only chant and get killed. It is a one-sided war.""
Eyewitnesses in Fardis, a city just to the west of Tehran, said that on Friday, members of the paramilitary Basij force under the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) suddenly attacked protesters after hours without a police presence on the streets.
The forces, who were in uniform and riding motorcycles, fired live ammunition directly at protesters, according to the witnesses. Unmarked cars were also driven into alleys, with occupants shooting at residents who were not involved in the protests, they said.
""Two or three people were killed in every alley,"" one witness alleged.
Those who have given accounts to BBC Persian say the reality inside Iran is hard for the outside world to imagine, and the death toll reported by international media so far only represents a fraction of their own estimates.
International news outlets are not allowed to work freely inside Iran and they are mostly relying on Iranian human rights groups who are active outside the country. On Monday the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 648 protesters in Iran had been killed, including nine people under the age of 18.
Some local sources and eyewitnesses report very high numbers of people killed across different cities, ranging from several hundreds to thousands.
The BBC is currently unable to independently verify these figures and, so far, Iranian authorities have not provided official or transparent statistics on the number of deaths of protesters.
However, Iranian media has reported that 100 security personnel had been killed during the protests, saying that protesters - whom they refer to as ""rioters"" - set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities.
Videos verified by BBC Persian's fact-checking team also show police vehicles and some government buildings being set alight in different locations during the protests.
Testimonies and video sent to BBC Persian are mainly from larger cities such as Tehran, nearby Karaj, Rasht in the north, Mashhad in the north-east, and Shiraz in the south. These areas have greater access to the internet via the Starlink satellite network.
Information from small towns - where many early casualties occurred - is scarce as their access to Starlink is very limited.
But the volume, consistency, and similarity of the accounts received from various cities point to the severity of the crackdown and the widespread use of lethal violence.
Nurses and medics who spoke to the BBC said they had seen numerous dead bodies and injured protesters.
They reported that hospitals in many cities had been overwhelmed and were unable to treat those with severe injuries, especially to the head and eyes. Some witnesses reported bodies ""stacked on top of each other"" and not handed over to families.
Graphic videos published on the activist-run Telegram channel Vahid Online on Sunday showed a large number of bodies at the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in Tehran, with many families either mourning or attempting to identify the corpses.
In one of the videos apparently from Kahrizak, relatives are seen looking at the photos of unidentified bodies displayed on a screen.
Many bodies in black bags were visible in the facility and on the street outside, only some of which seem to have been identified.
One video showed the inside of a warehouse containing several bodies, while another showed a truck being unloaded with people removing corpses from it.
A mortuary worker in a cemetery in Mashhad said that before sunrise on Friday morning between 180 and 200 bodies with severe head injuries were brought in and buried immediately.
A source in Rasht told BBC Persian that 70 bodies of protesters were transferred to a hospital mortuary in the city on Thursday. According to the source, security forces demanded ""payment for bullets"" before releasing bodies to families.
At the same time, a medical staff member at a hospital in eastern Tehran told BBC Persian that on Thursday, around 40 bodies were brought there the same day. The hospital's name has been withheld to protect the identity of the medic.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Sunday that he was ""shocked by reports of violence and excessive use of force by the Iranian authorities against protesters resulting in deaths and injuries in recent days"".
""I want to emphasise that regardless of the death toll, the use of lethal force by security forces is concerning,"" Mai Sato, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, told BBC Persian.

","A referee and a student are among hundreds of people reportedly killed during massive anti-government protests in Iran.
Coach Amir Mohammad Koohkan, 26, was hit by live ammunition on 3 January during protests in the town of Neyriz, his friend told BBC Persian.
""Everyone knew him for his kindness"", they said, adding his family is grieving and ""angry because he was killed by the regime"".
Five days later, student Rubina Aminian, 23, was shot from behind during a protest in Tehran, according to human rights groups. ""She fought for things she knew were right"", her uncle told CNN.
Nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of protests, a US-based rights group says.
Sources in Iran have told the BBC the death toll is likely higher than reported.
Demonstrations began on 28 December over the economy in the capital Tehran and have spread to 186 cities and all 31 provinces, according to the Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA).
The protests have grown into the largest in years, with calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The protests led to a government crackdown, with at least 10,600 people reportedly arrested and 496 protesters killed, according to HRANA.
Medical staff in Iran have described hospitals overwhelmed with dead and injured patients. BBC Persian verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on 9 January, and the BBC counted 180 body bags in footage from one morgue near Tehran thought to have been filmed on the same night.
The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.
Among the protest victims was Koohkan, who was killed in Neyriz in south-west Fars Province, his friend told BBC Persian. The friend did not witness the incident firsthand, but heard from eyewitnesses at the scene.
""It was far too soon for him, really far too soon. He was so young,"" the friend said.
The friend said they had known Koohkan, an indoor futsal (a form of football) coach and referee, for 10 years: ""From childhood he was my coach, then he became like my brother.""
They described Koohkan, who had one brother, as ""someone who didn't like to see people in this state... in this misery"".
""Everyone knew him for his kindness and good nature. The whole town loved him,"" his friend said. ""The family are both grieving and angry. Grieving because they lost their son, angry because he was killed by the regime.""
Also killed was Aminian, a Kurdish student who was shot from behind while taking part in a protest on Thursday, according to three rights groups.
Two groups - Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) and Kurdish organisation Hengaw - said she was shot in the head, while the Kurdistan Human Rights Network said she was shot in the back. Both Kurdish groups said she was shot by government forces.
The BBC has been unable to independently verify the circumstances of her death.
The 23-year-old, whose first name has also been spelled Robina or Roubina, was studying textile and fashion at Shariati Technical and Vocational College in Tehran, IHRNGO said.
""She was a strong girl, a courageous girl, and she was not someone you could control and make decisions for,"" her uncle told CNN. ""She fought for things she knew were right and fought hard.""
He added that she was ""thirsty for freedom, thirsty for women's rights"".
""Overall, she was a girl who was alive, who lived.""
Members of Aminian's family travelled from their hometown in Kermanshah, western Iran, to Tehran to identify her body after learning of her death, a source close to the family told INRNGO.
The family had to search through hundreds of bodies of young people killed in the protests at a location close to her college, the source said.
""It wasn't just my daughter; I saw hundreds of bodies with my own eyes,"" Aminian's mother said, in a statement from the source.
Iranian authorities allegedly initially refused to hand over Aminian's body to her family, then prevented her burial or mourning ceremonies in their hometown, the source said.
The family was reportedly forced to bury her along the road between Kermanshah and Kamyaran.
Iranian leader Khamenei has called anti-government protesters ""troublemakers,"" while US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene and said the US military is considering ""very strong options"".
Iran has also accused protesters of being backed by the US and Israel.
The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.
Then, more than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups.

","Iran has warned it will retaliate if attacked by the US, as BBC sources and activists report hundreds of protesters have now been killed in an escalating government crackdown.
""Things here are very, very bad,"" a source in Tehran said on Sunday. ""A lot of our friends have been killed. They were firing live rounds. It's like a war zone, the streets are full of blood. They're taking away bodies in trucks.""
The BBC counted about 180 body bags in footage from a morgue near Tehran. The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency says it has verified the deaths of 495 protesters and 48 security personnel nationwide.
Another 10,600 people have been detained over the fortnight of unrest, the agency says.
The US has threatened to intervene in Iran over the killing of protesters, but on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said that Iranian leaders had called him and that ""they want to negotiate"".
He added, however, that the US ""may have to act before a meeting"".
Trump has not elaborated on what the US is considering, but on Sunday he said ""we're looking at some very strong options"". He has been briefed on options for military strikes on Iran, an official told the BBC's US news partner CBS.
Other approaches could include boosting anti-government sources online, using cyber-weapons against Iran's military, or imposing more sanctions, officials told the Wall Street Journal.
Iran's parliament speaker warned that if the US attacked, both Israel and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets.
The protests which began over soaring inflation are now calling for an end to the clerical rule of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Iran's attorney general said anyone protesting would be considered an ""enemy of God"" - an offence that carries the death penalty - while Khamenei has dismissed demonstrators as a ""bunch of vandals"" seeking to ""please"" Trump.
On Sunday the country announced three days of mourning for what it called ""martyrs killed in Iranian national battle against the US and Israel"".
Staff at several hospitals have told the BBC they have been overwhelmed with dead or injured protesters in recent days.
BBC Persian has verified that 70 bodies were brought to one hospital in the city of Rasht on Friday night, while a health worker at a Tehran hospital told the BBC: ""Around 38 people died. Many as soon as they reached the emergency beds... direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well. Many of them didn't even make it to the hospital.""
The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.
Some footage has emerged, including video showing rows of body bags at the Forensic Diagnostic and Laboratory Center of Tehran Province - a morgue in Kahrizak.
In one video from the site, about 180 shrouded or wrapped figures can be seen, the majority lying out in the open. Shouts and cries of distress can be heard from people who appear to be looking for their loved ones.
Footage has been blurred to protect the identities of the living, who could face further persecution from the authorities.
Several videos confirmed as recent by BBC Verify show clashes between protesters and security forces in Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city.
Masked protesters can be seen taking cover behind bins and bonfires, with a row of security forces in the distance. A vehicle that appears to be a bus is engulfed in flames.
Multiple gunshots can be heard, and what sounds like banging on pots and pans.
A figure standing on a nearby footbridge appears to fire multiple gunshots in several directions as a couple of people take cover behind a fence.
In Tehran, a verified video from Saturday night shows protesters taking over the streets in the Gisha district, the sound of banging on pots in Punak Square, and a crowd marching and calling for the end of clerical rule in the Heravi district.

Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has blamed the US and Israel for the unrest.
""They have trained certain individuals inside the country and abroad, brought terrorists into the country from outside, set mosques on fire, and attacked markets and guilds in Rasht, setting the bazaar ablaze,"" he said without providing evidence.
However, footage authenticated by BBC Persian and BBC Verify confirms that Iran's security officers have been shooting at gatherings of protesters in several areas. They include Tehran, the western Kermanshah province, and the southern Bushehr region.
Multiple verified videos filmed in the centre of the western city of Ilam last weekend also show security forces firing shots towards Imam Khomeini Hospital, where protesters were holding a rally.
Internet access in Iran is largely limited to a domestic intranet, with restricted links to the outside world. But during the current protests, authorities have for the first time severely restricted that too.
An expert told BBC Persian the shutdown is more severe than during the ""Women, Life, Freedom"" uprising in 2022.
Alireza Manafi, an internet researcher, said the only likely way to connect to the outside world was via Starlink satellite, but warned users to exercise caution as such connections could potentially be traced by the government.
On Sunday, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, who lives in the US and whose return protesters have been calling for, told demonstrators that Trump had ""carefully observed your indescribable bravery"" in a social media post.
""Your compatriots around the world are proudly shouting your voice,"" he wrote, pledging: ""I know that I will soon be by your side.""
Pahlavi claimed the Islamic Republic was facing a ""severe shortage of mercenaries"" and that ""many armed and security forces have left their workplaces or disobeyed orders to suppress the people"". The BBC could not verify these claims.
He encouraged people to continue protesting on Sunday evening, but to stay in groups or with crowds and not ""endanger your lives"".
In the UK, videos shared on social media appear to show protesters removing Iran's flag from a balcony on its London embassy on both Saturday and Sunday.
Iran has summoned the UK ambassador in Tehran following the incidents, according to Iranian state media.
The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.
More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.

Last Kurdish forces leave Aleppo after ceasefire deal reached,2026-01-11T04:52:33.700Z," Tabby Wilson
","The final Kurdish fighters have withdrawn from the Syrian city of Aleppo, after the announcement of a ceasefire deal in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Mazloum Abdi, leader of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), said an agreement had been made via international mediation, securing the safe evacuation of ""martyrs, the wounded, the trapped civilians and the fighters"" from the city.
Buses carrying the last Kurdish-led SDF members were seen leaving the Kurdish majority neighbourhood of Sheikh Maqsoud, according to local media reports.
The latest clashes in Aleppo started earlier this week, after negotiations to integrate the Kurds into Syria's new government reached a stalemate.
At least 12 people were killed in the latest outbreak of violence, which also saw tens of thousands of civilians displaced after they were forced to flee Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh.
The Syrian army shelled the area on Wednesday afternoon after designating the neighbourhoods ""closed military areas"", in response to what it alleged were attacks by armed groups in the area.
The Kurdish-led SDF - which insists it has no military presence in Aleppo - called it a ""criminal attempt"" to forcibly displace residents.
A ceasefire was raised earlier in the week, but Kurdish forces refused to leave the last stronghold of Sheikh Maksoud under the deal.
In March 2025, the Kurdish-led SDF, which controls much of Syria's north-east and has tens of thousands of fighters, signed a deal to integrate all military and civilian institutions into the Syrian state.
Both sides accusing each other of trying to derail the negotiations that followed, with the agreement still not realised almost a year later.
The newest iteration of the ceasefire agreement was mediated by the US and other world powers, following concern that the stand-off in Aleppo risked Turkey's involvement.
Turkey backs the Syrian government and considers the Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF a terrorist organisation.
In a post to X on Saturday, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, said he had met the Syrian president and urged all parties to ""exercise maximum restraint, immediately cease hostilities, and return to dialogue"" in accordance with the March agreement.
He added that the US has welcomed Syria's ""historic transition"", and would extend its support to President Ahmed al-Sharaa as he ""works to stabilize the country"".

","Staff at several hospitals in Iran have told the BBC their facilities are overwhelmed with dead or injured patients, as major anti-government protests continue.
A medic at one Tehran hospital said there were ""direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well"", while a doctor said an eye hospital in the capital had gone into crisis mode.
Two of the medical workers who spoke to the BBC said they treated gunshot wounds from both live ammunition and pellets.
On Friday, the US repeated that killing protesters would be met with a military response. Iran blamed the US for turning peaceful protests into what it called ""violent subversive acts and widespread vandalism"".
Reacting to the latest developments, President Trump posted on social media: ""Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!""
Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of death and injury
The protests began in the capital Tehran a fortnight ago over economic hardship.
They have since spread to more than 100 cities and towns across all of Iran's provinces. Hundreds of protesters are believed to have been killed or injured, and many more detained. BBC Persian has confirmed the identities of 26, including six children.
Members of the security forces have also been killed, with one human rights group putting the number at 14.
BBC Persian has verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on Friday night. The morgue there was at full capacity, so the bodies were taken away. The authorities asked the relatives of the dead for 7 billion rials (£5,222; $7,000) to release them for burial, a hospital source said.
The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.
A hospital worker in Tehran described ""very horrible scenes"", saying there were so many wounded that staff did not have time to perform CPR.
""Around 38 people died. Many as soon as they reached the emergency beds... direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well. Many of them didn't even make it to the hospital.
""The number was so large that there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another.
""After the morgue became full, they stacked them on top of one another in the prayer room,"" she said.
The hospital worker said the dead or wounded were young people.
""Couldn't look at many of them, they were 20-25 years old.""
A doctor who contacted the BBC via a Starlink satellite connection on Friday night said Tehran's main eye specialist centre, Farabi Hospital, had gone into crisis mode with emergency services overwhelmed.
Non-urgent admissions and surgeries were suspended and staff called in to deal with emergency cases, he said.
Iran's security forces often use shotguns which fire cartridges filled with pellets during confrontations with protesters.
Another doctor from the city of Kashan in central Iran told the BBC many injured protesters had been hit in the eyes, and that his colleagues in hospitals across the city reported receiving many wounded people during Friday night's unrest.
Thursday night produced similar accounts.
A doctor at a medical centre in Tehran told the BBC: ""The number of injured people and fatalities was very high. I saw one person who had been shot in the eye, with the bullet exiting from the back of his head.
""Around midnight, the centre's doors were closed. A group of people broke the door and threw a man who had been shot inside, then left. But it was too late - he had died before reaching hospital and could not be saved.""
The BBC also obtained a video and audio message from a medic at a hospital in the south-west city of Shiraz on Thursday, who said large numbers of injured were being brought in, and the hospital did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx.
What footage is emerging from Iran shows protesters in Tehran taking to the streets en masse on Friday night, burning vehicles, and a government building set alight in Karaj, near the capital.
The Iranian army has since said it will join security forces in defending public property.
It follows reports that Iranian security forces were spread thin as the unrest extended throughout the country.
Iranian authorities issued a series of co-ordinated warnings to protesters on Friday, with the National Security Council saying ""decisive"" legal action would be taken against ""armed vandals"".
Iranian police maintained that no one was killed in Tehran on Friday night, though they said 26 buildings were set on fire, causing extensive damage.
An eyewitness who joined the protests on Thursday and Friday nights in Tehran told BBC Persian Television that Gen Z Iranians have been instrumental in encouraging their parents and older people to come out and join the protest marches, urging them not to be afraid.
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday that Europe backed Iranians' mass protests and condemned the ""violent repression"" against demonstrators.
UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said on Friday the international body was very disturbed by the loss of life.
""People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,"" he said.
French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz released a joint statement on Friday calling on Iranian authorities to ""allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal"".
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday, saying: ""The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this.""
In later remarks broadcast on state television, Khamenei reiterated that his regime ""will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements"" who he said were ""trying to please the president of the US"".
Meanwhile, the son of Iran's last shah, who was deposed by an Islamic revolution in 1979, described the protests as ""magnificent"" and urged Iranians to continue over the weekend.
""Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres,"" Reza Pahlavi said in a social media video.
US-based Pahlavi also said he was preparing to return to the country.
But former UK ambassador to Iran Sir Simon Gass told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""we really shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves"" when discussing regime change.
He said the lack of organised opposition within Iran meant people did not have an alternative figure to coalesce around as things stood.
However, he noted the protests were ""a much wider movement"" than previous flare-ups, which were triggered by Iranians finding it ""almost impossible to make ends meet because of the disaster to the economy"".
On Friday, President Trump reiterated his threat to Iran's leadership that the US would ""hit them very hard"" if they ""start killing people"".
He clarified that this did not mean ""boots on the ground"". Last year, the US conducted air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Meanwhile, the US state department said accusations by Iran's foreign minister that Washington and Israel were fuelling the protests were a ""delusional attempt to deflect"" attention from the challenges the regime was facing.
Taghi Rahmani, an Iranian political activist who spent 14 years in prison and whose wife, Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, was re-arrested in December, said any lasting change must come from Iranians instead of foreign intervention.
The protests have been the most widespread since a 2022 uprising sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups.

Iran leader says protesters are vandals trying to please Trump,2026-01-10T01:32:05.670Z," Mallory Moench
","Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called anti-government protesters ""troublemakers"" who are trying ""to please the president of the US"".
Iran also sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council blaming the US for turning the protests into what it called ""violent subversive acts and widespread vandalism"" in Iran. Trump, meanwhile, said Iran was ""in big trouble"".
The protests, in their 13th day, erupted over the economy and have grown into the largest in years - leading to calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and some urging the restoration of the monarchy.
At least 48 protesters and 14 security personnel have been killed, according to human rights groups.
An internet blackout is in place.
""We will be hitting them very hard where it hurts,"" Trump said at the White House on Friday, adding that his administration was watching the situation in Iran carefully and that any US involvement does not mean ""boots on the ground"".
""It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,"" he said.
These remarks echo ones the US president made about the Iranian government on Thursday, where he pledged to ""hit them very hard"" if they ""start killing people"".
Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday.
""Let everyone know that the Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this,"" the 86-year-old said.
Later, in remarks made to a gathering of supporters and broadcast on state television, Khamenei doubled down, saying Iran ""will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements"".
Iran's United Nations ambassador accused the US of ""interfering in Iran's internal affairs through threats, incitement, and the deliberate encouragement of instability and violence,"" in a letter to the Security Council.
Since protests began on 28 December, in addition to the 48 protesters killed, more than 2,277 individuals have also been arrested, the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) said.
The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, had been killed.
BBC Persian has spoken to the families of 22 of them and confirmed their identities. The BBC and most other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran.
In a joint statement, the leaders of the UK, Germany and France said they were ""deeply concerned about reports of violence by Iranian security forces, and strongly condemn the killing of protesters"".
""The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal,"" French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.
UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the United Nations was very disturbed by the loss of life. ""People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,"" he said.
Meanwhile the Iranian security and judicial authorities issued a series of coordinated warnings, hardening their rhetoric and echoing an earlier message of ""no leniency"" by Iran's top security body, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).
Iran's National Security Council - responsible for domestic security and not to be confused with the SNSC - said ""decisive and necessary legal action will be taken"" against protesters, which it described as ""armed vandals"" and ""disruptors of peace and security"".
In a brief statement, it warned against ""any form of attack on military, law-enforcement, or governmental facilities"". The intelligence arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said it would not tolerate what it described as ""terrorist acts"", asserting that it would continue its operations ""until the complete defeat of the enemy's plan"".
Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah who was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution, called on Trump on Friday to ""be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran"".
Pahlavi, who lives close to Washington DC, had urged protesters to take to the streets on Thursday and Friday.
Protests have taken place across the country, with BBC Verify verifying videos from 67 locations.
On Friday, protesters amassed after weekly prayers in the south-eastern city of Zahedan, videos verified by BBC Persian and BBC Verify show. In one of the videos, people can be heard chanting ""death to the dictator"", referencing Khamenei.
In another, protesters gather near a local mosque, when several loud bangs can be heard.
Another verified video from Thursday showed a fire at the office of the Young Journalists Club, a subsidiary of state broadcaster Irib, in the city of Isfahan. It is unclear what caused the fire and if anyone was injured.
Photos received by the BBC from Thursday night also show cars overturned and set alight at Tehran's Kaaj roundabout.
The country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, with minor amounts of traffic returning on Friday, internet monitoring groups Cloudfare and Netblocks said. That means less information is emerging from Iran.
IHRNGO director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said in a statement that ""the extent of the government's use of force against protesters has been increasing, and the risk of intensified violence and the widespread killing of protesters after the internet shutdown is very serious"".
Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi has warned of a possible ""massacre"" during the internet shutdown.
One person who was able to send a message to the BBC said he was in Shiraz, in southern Iran. He reported a run on supermarkets by residents trying to stock up on food and other essentials, expecting worse days to come.

The shutdown of the internet has meant that cash machines are not working, and there is no way to pay for purchases in shops where debit cards cannot be used due to the lack of internet.
Mahsa Alimardani, who works for the human rights NGO Witness, told the BBC in London that she had not been able to make contact with her family since Thursday evening.
""It's very anxiety-inducing, not having access to information, not knowing if your loved ones participated [in the protests] or if they're okay,"" she said.
The protests began nearly two weeks ago with shopkeepers in Tehran angry about the collapsing currency, before spreading to students and street demonstrations.
The last major protests were in 2022, when demonstrations erupted after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.
More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.

","Tehran has witnessed its largest anti-government demonstrations in decades, as protests swept through dozens of districts across the capital and its wider metropolitan area of nearly 16 million people.
For several hours there on Thursday night, security forces appeared unusually restrained. In areas where crowds were especially large, police and security units largely avoided direct confrontation, raising questions about whether the authorities were deliberately holding back.
That restraint, however, appears selective and strategic rather than absolute. While Tehran has seen a comparatively cautious approach, reports from smaller cities and provinces around the country tell a far more violent story.
According to multiple Iranian human rights organisations, including the Germany-based Kurdish Iranian human rights group Hengaw and US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (Hrana), more than 40 people have been killed since the protests began nearly two weeks ago.
BBC Persian's verification team has confirmed the identities of at least 21 victims through interviews with relatives, many of whom were killed in Lorestan and Kurdish-majority regions of Illam and Kermanshah provinces. Video evidence obtained by the BBC shows security forces firing directly at protesters. At least four security forces have also been killed.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has issued a firm warning, declaring that the Islamic Republic ""will not back down in the face of vandals"". In a speech on Friday addressing the unrest, he framed the protests as foreign-inspired sabotage.
Referring to property damage in Tehran, he said demonstrators had destroyed their own buildings ""just to please the president of the United States"".
Following the seizure by the US of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, many within Iran's leadership are increasingly concerned that the United States may be serious about its threats, particularly after a 12-day war with Israel last June, during which the US bombed Iran's nuclear sites, and the weakening of Iranian-backed militant groups across the region.
It is possible these developments could embolden Washington to strike Iran without fear of significant retaliation.
President Donald Trump has loomed large over the regime's calculations. Since almost the start of the protests, Trump has issued repeated warnings to Tehran, stating that the US would respond forcefully if peaceful protesters were killed.
In a recent US radio interview, Trump said Iran would ""get hit very hard"" if it repeated the mass killings seen during previous uprisings. He downplayed responsibility for deaths so far by attributing some to ""stampedes"", but stressed that Iranian authorities had been ""told very strongly"" where the red lines lay.
It is not clear whether these warnings may be behind the regime's response. In Tehran, where symbolically the costs are greatest, security forces appear to be exercising restraint to avoid images of mass bloodshed. Gunshots were reportedly heard late Thursday night in Tehran, but due to the near blackout of the internet it is difficult to verify exactly what is happening in the city.
Outside the capital, however, repression has been swift and lethal.
During the mass protests in Iran in 2022 following the death of the Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran, more than 500 people were killed, human rights groups say. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with its affiliated militias and anti-riot police, played a pivotal role in violently suppressing those protests.
Historically, the Islamic Republic has relied on a layered security apparatus to suppress mass protests. Alongside riot police, the regime deploys the Basij militia - a volunteer paramilitary force under IRGC control - often operating in plain clothes.
In more intense situations, command shifts from police to IRGC commanders, signalling that unrest is being treated as a national security threat rather than a civil disturbance. This escalation typically precedes harsher crackdowns, including mass arrests and lethal force.
Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has called for tolerance of what he described as ""legitimate protests,"" but his authority is limited. Ultimate control over security policy rests with the supreme leader, not the presidency.
The current approach suggests the regime is buying time, attempting to exhaust protesters, limit casualties in visible areas, and avoid crossing thresholds that could provoke direct foreign retaliation.

\section{Provide formal proofs of the following claims using proof techniques that we have learned
during the course.}

\subsection{Define $a_1 = 1$ and $a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 1$ for $n \geq 2$.
Prove that for all positive integers $n \in \mathbb{N}$, it holds that $a_n = 2^n - 1$.}

\subsection{Prove that for all non-negative integers $n \in \mathbb{N}$ it holds that $3|4^n+5$.}

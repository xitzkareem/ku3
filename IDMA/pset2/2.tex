\section{For each of the propositional logic formulas below, determine whether it is a tautology
or not. If the formula is not a tautology, show how to add a single connective to make it into a
tautology. Please make sure to justify your answers (e.g., by presenting truth tables, or by using
rules for rewriting logic formulas that we have learned in class).}

\subsection{$((p \wedge q) \to r) \leftrightarrow ((q \vee r) \vee \neg p)$}

\section{One annoying feature of merge sort is that it ignores long runs of already sorted elements.
Your task in this problem is to analyse a modified algorithm by Jakob intended to fix this.
The merge part of the algorithm would be essentially the same as before:}


\subsection{Is the pseudocode algorithm above correct in that for any input array A it will be the case
that mergerunssort (A) returns the same array but sorted in increasing order?}


\subsection{Regardless of whether the sorting algorithm is correct or not, does it always terminate
(assuming that the input is an array of elements that can be compared with <=) and, if so,
what is the worst-case time complexity?}


\subsection{Can you give any example of a family of input arrays of growing size for which Jakob's
merge runs sort algorithm will output a correctly sorted array and be asymptotically faster
than the merge sort algorithm that we have covered in class? Can you give any example of
a family of input arrays of growing size for which merge runs sort will be asymptotically
slower than standard merge sort?}

\section{When constructing this problem set, Jakob ran into some very unfortunate problems.
1. that all swans have the same colour (presumably white, so that there are no black swans
after all), and 2. that all positive integers are in fact equal.
Both of these claims are fairly disturbing from a mathematical point of view. Please help Jakob
by pointing out clearly what goes wrong in his induction proofs below.}



\subsection{All swans have the same colour.}

\subsection{All positive intergers are equal to each other}
For the base case Jakob uses the fact that 1 is equal to itself, hence he uses the equation n=n. For the induction step, he uses a different induction hypothesis n= n-1. 
This is counter intuitive. If we work backward and test the base case for the induction hypothesis, we see that the induction hypothesis fails in the base case scenario, which proves 
that the theorem is wrong. 
For $n_0 = 1$
\begin{equation}
	P(n_0) : n_0 = n_0 -1 = 1 \neq 1-1 
\end{equation}
